Over that journey, our understanding of issues undermining youth access to the employment market – one of the dimensions of our challenge - has kept increasing thanks to focus discussion groups, surveys and meetings with the Ministry in charge of Employment and Vocational Training, the National Employment Fund, young job seekers, recruitment agencies, economic operators and private sector associations, universities, among others. After attending one of those meetings, a skills caravan organized in April 2021 by the GIZ on vocational training, strong and pervasive coordination failures undermining the functioning of the job market emerged as one of the main root causes explaining long term unemployment and higher unemployment rate among young people.
- -A bit of theory: an introduction to the concept of coordination failures...-Coordination issues are largely documented in the economic literature. Coordination failures arise when an outcome is the result of a complementarity of actions performed by two or several stakeholders. They contradict traditional classical economy thoughts according to which market, guided by Adam Smith invisible hand, automatically adjusts thanks to price.-Depending on whether coordination failures are addressed or not, variations in the level of commitment and intensity of actions by stakeholders can lead to a variety of low, intermediate and high equilibria (see graph). Coordination failures are now considered worldwide as one of the most powerful impediments to development efforts at the macro, meso and micro level.- -... And its implication for the Cameroonian job market -Far from being a theoretical reality, coordination issues may explain the paradox of the Cameroonian formal job market. Especially, on its sub compartment where the supply is driven by private sector formal corporations.-Taken individually, each  category of market players exhibits a great dynamism and willingness either to look for a job or to create the conditions for recruiting. Yet collectively, intermediation performances are pretty bleak as illustrated by a few statistics. It takes on average 26 months for a young Cameroonian to find a job. And unemployment rate among the Youth is also significantly higher (8.9% vs 5.7% for the general population).-A root cause analysis for each relevant group of stakeholders active on the Cameroonian stakeholders revealed that a variety of factors limit on a daily basis the ability and capacity of stakeholders to fully play their role in the market and contribute to higher equilibria, characterized by more job ads posted and satisfied.-Let’s start first, with young people, our target job seeker group. Those we have been meeting through several selection processes for post-Covid-19 recovery programs mention a job quest that included dozens of applications, years of search and a succession of odd jobs. They generally complained about their not finding the supply and not knowing where job vacancies are. Their willingness to enter the job market was often hindered by several factors: limited knowledge of job search techniques but also the costs related to job search. As an illustration, many job ads are published in newspapers, a source of information that many young Cameroonians cannot afford. Finally, as their job search longs and despair grew, they often admitted translating their frustration into accusations of opaque hiring practices by employers.-The latter reported difficulties in filling their vacancies and challenges reaching job seekers. Once again, size and resources seemed to be a selection factor as small enterprises do not often have real human resources expertise and cannot afford lengthy recruitment process. As I visited several hair salons, mechanics and carpentries during the skills caravan, many small enterprise owners confessed that they had no knowledge of free recruitment platforms and programs operated by public stakeholders. As their scope of opportunities is restricted, managers end up recruiting either the first comer or recommended people, with no thorough vetting process. With often disillusion as an outcome. Large corporations also complain of high costs to find and attract the rare gem, despite their multiplying job posting channels through social networks, publication in newspapers and use of the National Employment Fund platform. -Finally, actors at the core of the intermediation process, whether private or public, also reported difficulties in finding and matching the supply or demand. That compartment of the market is animated by complex strategies and a myriad of stakeholders. It could be best characterized as a fringe oligopoly led by the public employment agency. Ministries in charge of Employment and Vocational Training, Tertiary Education, Youth, Women Protection and Family and Agriculture, among others, manage several programs aimed at matching their beneficiaries with job opportunities, with often limited coordination and redundances. On the private sector side, competition among a multitude of recruitment agencies paves the way to limited coordination of their profession at the national level, resulting in a weak collective negotiation power, especially when they plea for reforms. As they fail to cooperate, expenditures to build a comprehensive job seeker database, the holy grail, cannot be shared. As a result, many recruitment agencies have to specialize on niche markets, characterized by a specific customer, sector or geographic zone, with most young Cameroonian unable to access their services.- -For public institutions operating in the job market, scarce resources, to find a job to thousands of young Cameroonians arriving on the job market represent a major impediment to their activity. So do often unfounded thoughts about their intermediation capacity. The latter often prevent many private corporations from using public actor job intermediation services. Public intermediation capacity also suffers from various uncoordinated initiatives and programs by national and international partners that often dilute efforts and prevent the completion of the critical mass. More specifically, as Youth has become a priority in the development agenda, nearly each development partner has developed its cash-for work, internship or placement own program aimed at increasing employment opportunities or employability. But it is difficult to know who does “What”, “When”, “Where” and “For Whom”. As far as coordination is concerned, development partners have so far not been very successful in coordinating themselves and in assisting the stakeholders of the job market to better work together.
-All in all, mistrust, domination of sub optimal responses in the realm of cooperative games, and limited mechanisms to exchange both information and job ads among all the stakeholders create the conditions for weak levels of intermediation on the Cameroonian job market.
- -Our next step addressing coordination failures-So, here is the background. From discussions with colleagues of other Accelerator Labs in sub-Saharan countries, the outlook appears to be the same. And from the latter, solutions to coordination failures represent a policy priority, given the stakes. As a matter of fact, youth might be synonymous of a ticking demographic bomb, if no responses are found. And this might be even more relevant as social tensions have been heightened by the Covid-19 crisis. On the other hand, Cameroon and Africa will benefit from the promises of the demographic dividend, provided structural issues hindering the access of young people to the job market are addressed.-This is why strategic stakeholders should encourage coordination efforts around the market. This is why AccLab Cameroon has embarked in two experiments focused on promoting a holistic approach involving the private and public sectors, but also development partners as well as the civil society. The first one aims at improving coordination in the regular compilation of job market statistics, so that all stakeholders may know where the tensions are. The second experiment aims at increasing coordination of systemic stakeholders as they try to provide solutions to those tensions. And the next blog of our series will introduce both experiments. -Special thanks to Hermann Aurelien Kamougne Ndjampa of UNDP, for the layout and to Yannick Elouga, Euphrasie Kouame and Anna Ojong for their pieces of advice.

This decision is rooted in a paradox. The sector is of systemic importance, as it represents the second source of export revenues for the country, after oil. Yet, cocoa planters hardly receive the recognition they deserve by the media and many Cameroonians who tend to focus on more glamorous occupations, ignoring thus the difficulties in that sector. As a reminder, 257 151 tons were collected for the 2019-2020 campaign, -2% in comparison to the previous period, and cocoa tonnage produced has been decreasing since 2016.- - -Meeting Mr. Fouda: A long and rich journey that became our 101’s guide to the Cameroonian cocoa value chain
-Our second meeting with Mr. Fouda, a cocoa planter, took place in that context as the Accelerator Lab team tried to better understand the issues plaguing the Cameroonian cocoa value chain. Far away from our office  in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, the meeting took place in Tambe - a typical village, located in one of the Cameroonian cocoa belts - where he owned a 4 hectares cocoa field planted with young trees.-This encounter confirmed my opinion on cocoa planters. They resembled in many respects those characters portrayed by Hemingway or Zola and who are full of exceptional energy, calm and determination. Like those characters, Cameroonian cocoa planters wage  a daily struggle against an indomitable force, here the rainforest, as a large part of cocoa harvested in Cameroon is planted under trees, deep under the canopy.
-This mode of exploitation requires a constant commitment from planters. On a daily basis, they have to cover long distances on foot to monitor the growth of their cocoa trees. This activity which is imperious to prevent the spread of diseases that can ruin months of labor in a few days. And because meccanization is only a faraway dream, all works have to be done with machetes. And this from the maintenance of the tiny paths linking main roads to fields located deep in the forest to the logging of trees to provide light for the young cocoa trees. 
-According to Google Map the journey to meet Mr. Fouda and his fellow cocoa planters was supposed to last 3 hours and 37 minutes. In real life conditions, it took the UNDP Cameroun Accelerator Lab Team more than eight hours to travel the 161 kilometers between Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, and Tambe. For us, this journey was synonymous of dusty roads, hardly practicable, wooden bridges and a foretaste of the various logistical post-harvest constraint faced by planters as they have to transport cocoa bags from their fields to commercial hubs. It was also an opportunity to deploy the know-how of the Accelerator Lab. Audrey Moneyang, our Head of Exploration was able to discuss with planters about their constraints. Anna Ojong, our Head of Solution Mapping did collect local answers used by planters to solve their challenges. Finally, as the Head of Experimentation, this journey, which may have lasted several days during the rainy season, was an opportunity to test and start validating several innovations.-In fact, our mission to Tambe had started a few days ago as we were incidentally introduced to Mr. Fouda, by the Head of the TRIDOM II project, a UNDP Cameroon unit working to maintain biodiversity in the Congo Basin.  The encounter was rooted in our first frontier challenge aimed at improving the access of young people to entrepreneurship and employment. Early sensing activities concluded that young people in rural areas were often the poor relative of Youth policies. Though, they account for 42 % of that age group, young rural people have access to fewer technological and job opportunities, with more than 70% of people living in rural areas occupied in agriculture, according to ILO.
- -.-As we analyzed those realities, we decided to give more attention to young people living in rural areas. Systemic thinking exercise led us to understand that actions aimed at improving the functioning of agricultural ecosystems may have decisive impact on their living. And cocoa production immediately emerged as a game changer for many reasons. First, it is estimated that 1 out of 4 Cameroonians live directly or indirectly from cocoa value chain. Secondly, the sector is said to employ more than 600 000 people. Finally, that crop is cultivated in 7 of 10 regions of the countries.-An initial analysis of the potential leverage points for the Accelerator Lab focused on the constraints undermining the daily routine of young farmers. As we discussed with them, they pointed poor access to inputs and seeds as the first bottleneck upstream in the value chain. Then, insects and diseases that constantly threaten the health of the cocoa tree, leaves and pods were identified as a major issue. Logistical issues also undermine their efforts as illustrated by post-harvest costs estimated for each ton.-Innovators and Accelerator Lab Team discuss cocoa production issues with planters in Tambe, Centre province of Cameroon.

Location: Tambe, Centre Province of Cameroon | Credit: Rodrigue Martial Mbarge et Severin Ndemanou- -Those issues arise right after the collecting of cocoa pods as planters must first rent moto taxis, called “benskins”, to help them carry bags one by one from deep inside the forest to villages, before having to wait for trucks. Mistrust represents another issue as it undermines the functioning of farmer’s groups. Thus, planters must often yield to the purchasing power of “coxeurs”, as they fail to present a common stance in terms of selling price and conditions.
-Beyond those pre and post-harvest root causes, planters are not engaged in transformation and sell their product raw, after drying and sorting. All in all, those factors explain that planters only reap on average 6 % of the price of a chocolate bar, according to Fairtrade, whereas they account for the most labor-intensive part of the value chain.-An overview of logistical operations in the cocoa value chain.

-Considering the above root causes undermining planter’s value creation, a strengths/weaknesses analysis pointed that it would be difficult in a limited time lapse to address the road and logistical constraints. Alternatively, a series of factors led to focus the AccLab first intervention on improving the management of diseases by planters. According to planters, diseases and insects decrease potential production by up to 30 % of losses. Long distance and steep terrain make it difficult to monitor diseases in plantations. Young planters also expressed their difficulties to identify the illnesses and insects affecting cocoa trees as they often received limited training on that topic, in the realm of state-sponsored programs to revive the cocoa sector. Finally, planters suffer from poor intergenerational knowledge transmission on diseases, leading to above average losses for young planters, poverty, and rural exodus. And because of some of those issues, treatments are not often adapted to the disease or poorly executed.-The strategy to provide solutions to Mr. Fouda and his colleagues included the preparation of several experiments aimed at improving disease management by farmers. They are ongoing and include technological, institutional and socio-cultural innovations. An example of innovation that we would like to test is the introduction in the community of discussion groups on cocoa diseases. In the realm of that grassroot cheap solution, planters may collect samples of leaves or cocoa pods affected by a disease or insect and organize thematic discussions.-Harnessing drone and Artificial Intelligence to better monitor the myriad of diseases affecting cocoa production-Beyond that example, we used our field trip to Tambe to test some more technological innovations. In particular, we team up a Cameroonian innovator, William Elong, who has been working on drone imagery solutions with a young developer, Giovanni Gweth, specialized in artificial intelligence. Both have quite a record in their respective fields of expertise. The final objective of that association was to develop and test a solution able to use drone imagery to obtain nearly real time detection and monitoring of diseases across large spaces, for cocoa trees located under the canopy. -Right: Discussion between the technical team before the launch of the drone. Left: drone operations and its interest are presented to Mr. Fouda, a cocoa planter. Location: near Tambe, Centre Province of Cameroon | Credit: Rodrigue Martial Mbarge et Severin Ndemanou-Ease, coverage, speed and accuracy of disease monitoring were some of the selection criteria that fueled the launch of that experiment. A more precise identification of diseases thanks to a broader database pleads in favor of that solution. From discussions with our innovators emerged the perspective of an easier and quicker monitoring of disease. Currently, this process is time-consuming and exhausting. Mr. Fouda estimated at two to three days the time necessary to perform a quick and inaccurate scan of diseases on his 4 hectares. Meanwhile, several trees can be infected by a disease, such as the swollen shoot, a virus that has been decimating cocoa plantation all over Africa.
-Beyond the Lab Team, we brought a drone operator in Tambe. Drone detection of diseases is not new in Cameroon as that technology has been used for pineapple fields owned by large corporations. Yet, this trip was a good opportunity for him to discover the limits of drone operations under the rainforest canopy. The artificial intelligence engine’s developer was also able to better calibrate his “supervised deep learning” model thanks to discussions with planters and pictures taken by the drone. “Deep learning” models applied to imagery involves creating digital neurons that can replicate the workings of the brain to detect objects and features in pictures. The neural network thus created is trained, like the brain, to recognize objects and their characteristics (in our case diseased leaves and pods). In our case, much like a child's first steps, artificial intelligence network training is accomplished by submitting images of both good and bad leaves or pods to the neural network. Like the human brain, the artificial intelligence model will be able to subsequently detect diseased leaves and pods on new images provided by the drone.-All in all, preliminary results from that field missions are promising. Drone flights went well but we discover that we should privilege some types of drone equipment as their radio signals are less jammed by giant trees. Drones were also able to maneuver below the canopy quite easily, despite the challenge. More importantly, it was estimated that a drone can cover more than 20 hectares per hour in that environment, more than what a planter can in 24 days, if we consider the monitoring rate given by Mr. Fouda. Early results from the artificial intelligence engine are also good as highlighted in this video. It detected cocoa pods and leaves affected by disease or insects as highlighted in this video, with an accuracy rate of 80% so far. That rate will increase as the deep learning neurons are enriched with more pictures and cases of diseases.-The Accelerator Lab Team is currently planning a second mission in Tambe in July to experiment other solutions and deepen results for the Artificial Intelligence/Drone combination. Technically, the mission will aim at testing medium and long-range detection but also operations during the rainy season. Geolocation of sick cocoa trees and fully automatic are also on the table to address the challenge of the rainforest environment. Finally, it would also be an opportunity to train planters to the solution, validate various User Experiences and to answer questions on their capacity to master and adopt such a technological innovation, given the limited exposure of planters in rural areas to digital solution.

-Once upon a time, a Solutions Mapper participated in a COVID-19 support mission to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on youth and women in ten communities of the Far-North region of Cameroon. The mission was part of the UNDP Cameroon Country office’s response initiative to address increased vulnerability brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic on local populations’ livelihood and income. The project called “Cash for Work”, aimed to bring simple solutions to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID on 500 youth and Women, who have been affected by the pandemic in terms of jobs losses in these communities.
- -Taking part in such a mission was such a great idea for the new Accelerator Lab team! It was an opportunity to explore further to understand the emerging challenges and opportunities surrounding youth employment in rural communities. An opportunity to identify typical grassroot solutions to challenges of youth employment and entrepreneurship, our first frontier challenge, just so you know!-I was excited, well prepared with a questionnaire that I thought would trigger insightful responses from the participants of the different focus group discussions the lab aimed to have on the perceptions and perspectives of this assistance from UNDP. Before the mission, I thought the issues raised in the questionnaire would be the main concerns of the local youths and women; in fact, I had a preconceived idea of what their challenges might be. Albeit, that wasn’t the case when we got to the field and started talking to these people.
-""Interesting to note, my concerns on youth employment and excitement to identify local solutions that address unemployment was the least of priorities raised by men and women in these communities"".
-A number of  challenges were mentioned that varied between men and women, ranging from COVID-19, climate change and environmental factors impacting on  agriculture and food security, education, infrastructure, ,non-scalarization of the girl child, gender inequality, insecurity, and health care concerns!-The insecurities affecting the far-north region of Cameroon since 2014 with the onset of the Boko Haram attacks has deprived some of the most vulnerable groups from development opportunities, led to unequal distribution of resources and increased inequalities between men and women. Existing harsh and extreme climatic conditions impacting on agriculture and livestock which are a principal activity in the region has not made things easier for the local population as well. In these difficult climatic conditions, the capacities to transform and store food to be used in moments of scarcity have remained low despite the flourishing market gardening activity in the region.-Above all, gender inequalities characterized by increased unpaid labor for women, absence of services capable of responding to their specific needs and capacities, discriminatory social norms impacting the economic growth of women and girls all continue to prevent them from utilizing their full potential.-Then the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the livelihood and income of men and women. Barrier and preventive measures characterized by border closures has continued to impact businesses and the flow of cash for men and women in these communities.-Talking to these local groups, their only request for comfort, stability and growth was “Means” ...they said!-« We need means and opportunities but COVID 19 has made things much difficult!» they said. -It was hard to go further without wanting to know more on the challenges these different groups encountered. Opportunities for escaping these challenges mentioned were a thin line between the realities of the region in terms of insecurity, climate change, environmental, socio-cultural factors and the current COVID-19 challenges.-At some point, going further to address the prepared questionnaire became difficult as feelings of empathy towards their challenging stories set in.  Instead of intended insights on the preference for monthly salary job types or income generating activities, their difficulties in accessing gainful employment, communication on employment opportunities, their needs for gaining decent employment, just to name a few, the stories from the different  ethnic groups, quite similar for all the communities  made me think otherwise with much focus on gaining more insights on the challenges they raised- The realities observed for the different groups did not facilitate my understanding on how I was supposed to stay focused on identifying solutions that work and which do not, in order to better mitigate the impact of COVID on employment opportunities for youth and women. Obviously not a homogenous group of persons, coupled with educational levels ranging from very low, low, medium, high, and very high.- However, the women of the Toupouri and Podoko ethnic groups in these communities shared very intriguing realities. Stories which revealed the need to restrategize development interventions at country office level, while laying more emphasis on the consideration of gender perspectives in UNDP’s work.-Discussions within these communities incorporated an ethnographic and gender sensitive approach. Separate group discussions were organized for men and women, including key informant interviews. Besides the need to capture firsthand and uninfluenced facts, it was an opportunity to understand what other domains the country office could focus its attention and strengthen its interventions when addressing development challenges such as youth unemployment.
- -Then came this quick instinct to understand the interplay between socio-cultural norms, COVID-19, and improved living standards in these communities after having an in-depth discussion with the female beneficiaries of this project. The “Cash for Work” intervention targeted 50% of women in each of these communities and listening to their stories was an eye-opening experience. Rethinking new development and investment opportunities for the Country office made more meaning as insights on integrating gender and women empowerment in development programmes were captured. This was equally an opportunity to think about unusual development actors for partnership with Country office, while addressing issues of unemployment in a COVID-19 context greatly affected by gender stereotypes and socio-cultural norms. Improving employability for youth and women in these communities through simple solutions that could bridge the gender gaps became a point of focus. The Cash for Work project intended to build back better from COVID with a goal of preventing vulnerable groups from joining radical extremist groups. Providing support to the country office for the realization of this goal could not be effective without understanding existing community challenges and opportunities. Certainly, there was another entry point to addressing decent work and economic growth! Understanding the inequalities between men and women and knowing how to address socio-economic growth of men and women from an inequality standpoint approach, rather than just COVID and Conflict, which by the way have only stimulated existing disparities in these communities.
-Evidences of a root cause to a problem initially identified were glaring and it was time to divert and get  focused on what could be described as a  “an intestinal parasite” for these communities, preventing the growth and development of specific groups.
-To most of these women, the cash for work activity was considered timely, “À point nommé!” as they exclaimed in the French language. It was a big relief not just to the socio-economic challenges posed by COVID-19, but most especially to the challenges posed by socio-cultural norms that have long been the modus operandi of these communities.-Community Realities faced by the Toupouri and Podoko Women-“We are not given an opportunity to exchange words with our spouses says Panta Kouma on behalf of the other women with whom she shares the same culture. From childhood we are made to understand this, and nothing can change. Even just responding to a man (spouse) who has wronged you is considered disrespectful” she added.
- -“The husbands here get us pregnant and disappear for even up to 2, 3, 5 and even 10 years before resurfacing”. During this time of their absence, these women are hardly ever informed of the whereabouts of their spouse. Some of these women while talking testified to have been victims and it was considered a common practice, while the burden of childcare remained her sole responsibility as they continued to struggle with their usual small businesses for survival.-High birthrates, little or no income to manage these hardships, no access to health care services, the absence of women empowerment centers and even a low knowledge of their sexual and reproductive health rights were realities of women belonging to these ethnic groups. Coupled with different forms of violence infringed on them by men who treat them like objects.  According to these women, the girl child was a perfect replacement and sacrifice for more children in a household. When space in the house became small to accommodate everyone, the girl child had to give way, they said funnily while laughing. In communities where houses are usually characterized by very small hurts built with mud bricks and grass roof tops, liberating space meant the future of the girl child was at risk,  forced marriages and her education which in these communities has never been prioritized like that of the male child!-Thus, there is definitely very limited opportunity for women to find decent employment opportunities in these communities as their childhood is constrained by the society in which they find themselves.
- -The woman is called upon to take responsibility of the family and so even when there is an incident of violence from the man, there is nothing she could really do to help herself because returning back to her parents will mean increasing the responsibilities of another woman, their mothers. Increased unpaid labor, hence little or no descent source of income!-Despite these hardships the wellbeing of the household and community remains the prime concern of these women. The Toupouri and Podoko women are sole providers in their homes. Even when the man earns an income, he spends it on “bilibili”, a locally made alcoholic drink from Millet, a commonly grown grain in the region.-Besides the effects of COVID-19 on youth and womens’ socio-economic status in these communities therefore, it was discovered that socio-cultural practices were a great barrier to an improved living standard for youth and women especially in these communities.  All these made it difficult to stay focused on the challenges of youth employment without a gender analysis approach for the purposes of leaving no one behind and because the girls were part of these groups of youths.-At the end of it all I realized that addressing issues on job accessibility for youth and women in grassroot communities needed to take a different approach from that in the urban areas.-Even when a non-homogenous population is a common factor for both rural and urban context, the situation in rural communities seems even more complex.-Equally more opportunities for entrepreneurship and employment in the informal sector were identified on which UNDP could build on to improve the employability of youth and women in these communities in the future.-Most of these vulnerable groups when asked did not prefer salary type jobs, but businesses they could run on their own to have time for other social engagements.-However, It is quite difficult to implement pro-gender policies in a context where surveys or traditional data gathering techniques do not work due to high illiteracy levels.-Unintentional biases from development actors was equally identified. Some communities have been classified as red zones (dangerous, high insecurities) and others as green zones (safe and accessible). This alone has contributed to some of the existing gaps in these communities, where development opportunities are rare and gender inequalities persist.-The good news or very remarkable aspect in these communities is that:-Contextual realities of the region have revealed the capacity of local populations to think creatively and adapt to different conditions, in their difficult context. 
-These local materials could be better valorized if reconstruction and rehabilitation projects by development actors encourage the use of such local materials.  Taking advantage of such opportunities could be another option for creating employment opportunities for youth in these communities-Water puddles for example are adopted as the most common adaptation measures for farming and livestock in the dry season. A system which is mostly conceived in rainy season where floods are common due to heavy rains. Farmers and cattle grazers take opportunity of this season to safe water for different purposes...irrigation and cattle consumption during the dry season often characterized by drought. In this case, local councils could take on contracts with youths in these communities, depending on their skills and capacities to enable them gain employment in the creation of water puddles seen as very essential in their different localities given the context of the region.
-In the absence of development opportunities in such remote communities, traditional development methods are quickly and easily valorized. Local resources are best put to value than when these communities receive aid from development actors.-Women in these communities, where socio-cultural norms are a threat to their wellbeing and economic growth secretly take contraceptives without their husbands’ knowledge to prevent unwanted pregnancies and also a safe way for them to reduce maternal and child mortality where access to health care is a problem leading to home deliveries where no medical personnel is available.-Future perspectives for the lab will entail an opportunity with strategic units within the Country office to analyze existing skills and opportunities for men and women in such communities largely characterized by discriminatory social norms such that future programmes and national initiatives better adapt to existing opportunities that match the skills of existing or available  human resources.

- -4 years. That's the time I spent looking for a job !-Those words came from Arnaud, one of the young participants of a Covid-19 relief program aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the Cameroonian economy. UNDP Cameroon Accelerator Lab (or AccLab) met him and various other young Cameroonians while providing technical assistance to fasten the implementation of that program.-Those encounters were a great source of learnings for us. Beyond Covid-19 and its impact, they led us to understand that finding a job was a long and tortuous obstacle course for most young Cameroonians. They represented opportunities to put a face on anonymous macro data and to meet directly with some of the 95% of young people entering the job market and not capable of finding a descent job. Those stirring meetings also bolstered our resolution to work on the first frontier challenge assigned to us  : find and assess solutions to reduce mismatches between the skills received by young graduates and the needs of the labor market. This blog post is a summary of our first steps in that discursive journey around that topic.-A Covid-19 relief program as an unexpected entry point in the subtleties of the Cameroonian job market
-“Le Grand délestage”. It is hard to find a proper translation from French to English of this expression which was used by Cameroonians to depict the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on their living standards. In Cameroon, “délestage” refers to sudden and long power outages affecting people and, more subtly, to all other negative social and practical consequences. During a random discussion session with the Acc Lab team, some young Cameroonians, trained by UNDP in the realm of a Covid-19 relief program, diverted this expression to characterize the unprecedented and massive hit of the pandemic on their activities, revenues and spending. For them, 2020 was definitely socially the year of the “Grand Délestage”. As in many African countries, the sanitary impact of the pandemic in Cameroon has been limited so far, yet Covid-19 has acted as a silent economic and social killer for thousands of households, especially in the agricultural sector. Accelerator Lab members, as many city dwellers, discovered early signs of that economic catastrophe as prices of some local perishable products usually on high demand were divided sometimes by 2 to 3 times the actual price, most often remained unbought, and rotted in the markets. Some of the reasons for this market crash were explained by early lockdowns, closure of trade borders and other barrier measures implemented too quickly to prevent the spread of the virus. Those measures forced the street food industry, an institution in Cameroon, with most people eating outside for breakfast, lunch or dinner, to close with an immediate impact across all agricultural value chains. -More than these anecdotal pieces of evidence of the impact of the crisis on the agricultural sector, the Rapid Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 (SEIA) undertaken early this year by UNDP Cameroon highlighted the profound impact of Covid-19 on agriculture, a sector that still employs 56% % of the population. Hence, the decision taken by the Country office to prioritize interventions in the agricultural sector for its Covid-19 relief funds aimed at supporting economic and social groups affected by the pandemic. The results of the call for applicants launched by UNDP Cameroon to select, train 500 entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector and equip 300 of them revealed the extent of the crisis as 5700 applications were received in 8 days. Given the number of applications, UNDP Cameroon AccLab Team was solicited to help fasten the selection process and training.-Beyond figures, the reading of applications was a revelation for our team of hundreds of micro tragedies affecting farmers and entire value chains. Limited financial assistance and the absence of storage facilities led many farms to shut down their operations. Beyond taking stock of the impact of the crisis, that mission was also for us a source of unexpected learnings and discovery on the unemployment challenge mission assigned to the AccLab Cameroon : finding solutions to reduce the frictions plaguing access to the Cameroonian job market, especially for the young people.-As a matter of fact, informal discussions set in after training sessions with participants focused on employment issues. Some participants like Arnaud told us that they wrote hundreds of applications and looked for a job for years. Despite holding a Master from the renowned Faculty of Agronomy and Agricultural Sciences (FASA) in the University of Dschang Cameroon, he looked for a job all over Cameroon for 4 years, unsuccessfully. He later turned to entrepreneurship. Many had the same story, with entrepreneurship not being a choice but an obligation.-Beyond one-on-one discussions, we decided to better understand factors that may explain dysfunctions in the job market. In Bafoussam, the main city of one of the four different regions of Cameroon in which capacity reinforcement bootcamps were organized, a first focus discussion group and a collective intelligence workshop were organized with 60 participants of our pool of agri business entrepreneurs-Discussions between the AccLab Team and participants, especially young ones, were fruitful, lively and highlighted direct but also indirect and unexpected causes. Among direct causes, many attendants pointed at the narrow size of the formal job market, which is too thin to absorb the number of young people looking for a job. As a matter of fact, it is estimated that 100,000 graduates enter the job market every year in Cameroon but only 5% get a decent job. Participants advocated for policies capable to widen the size of the market either by fostering private sector development and recruitments by SMEs or the civil service. Many of them openly acknowledged that the quality of the training they received was not up to the expectations of corporations, often blaming too theoretical curricula. -Much time was also spent discussing the issues surrounding employment of young graduates, as young people described the vicious circle around professional experience. Many participants stressed that only a minority were  able to get an internship and how difficult the journey to employment was for the majority who did not have that opportunity as employers focus on the need for work experience. Explanations for the lack of internships ranged from the weak internship culture in many corporations to limited financial resources available to pay interns for SMEs and public bodies.  -As confidence grew between participants and AccLab Team members, we were also able to explore some indirect and hidden factors plaguing the access to the job markets. -

-For most participants in the training, the functioning of the job market suffers from weak information mechanisms around job opportunities.
They demanded that more efforts would be placed around platforms disseminating job market opportunities in a transparent manner while denouncing some malpractices of the job market.-For a majority of those attending the training, recruitment processes were often too tricky, not transparent, mired with off-market and informal arrangements or relied on identitary factors. Women mentioned biases limiting their access to the job market ranging from doubts over the capacity to perform certain tasks to off-work solicitations. Finally, the functioning of the market was definitely not judged to be pro-poor but even more to widen inequalities. As a matter of fact, scarce resources limit from birth the level of qualifications that children from poor households may attain, therefore restricting their choices on the job market one decade later. Lack of resources also limits the capacity of poor young seekers to extend their job search and to accept low or unpaid internships as they are unable to afford transport costs from home to work. Many participants also explained that their access to the job market was doomed from their school years as their career orientation was mostly based on parents and relatives and did not include any information about promising sectors. -Through talking and discussions with participants, we received a lot of insights on the functioning of the job market and its issues. However, those pieces of information were mostly qualitative. Hence our decision to administer a survey on those topics on a pool of 500 people selected for the final training, with finally responses obtained from 216 people. That sample of the population must be qualified as it surely presents some biases. Participants are indeed more educated and more tech friendly than the average Cameroonian as the selection for the Covid-19 relief program required minimum technological awareness to fill the online form. As a matter of fact, 78 % of the respondents had an academic level beyond the Cameroon Advanced Level Certificate (High School certificate). However, some of the answers represent avenues for our work in the next months.- - -Long-term unemployment | weak career guidance mechanisms | poor information on job opportunities | gender biases and non transparent process plague access to jobs
-Source: UNDP Accelerator Lab Cameroon Survey on 216 participants to a Covid-19 relief program focused on agriculture
 -Finding # 1 : long term unemployement is a plague-42.1 % of respondents spent more than two years looking for a job and 9 out of 10 people interviewed declared that their search had been difficult or very difficult. Long term unemployment and job market facilitation represents therefore major issues and sources of work for the AccLab Cameroon.-Finding # 2 : access to employment is not always transparent-Participants highlighted the need for a more transparent job market. As an illustration, 3⁄4 of them considered that identity factors were a major determinant of access to employment. They also gave a poor assessment of information mechanisms aimed at disseminating job opportunities. Those findings represent a second avenue for AccLab Cameroon efforts to remove frictions in the job market.-Finding # 3 : more internships and sandwich courses are needed-Finally, responses to open questions on the adequation between curricula and job markets or the main issues of the job market and their solutions represent an inestimable source of knowledge that we intend to share and exploit with UNDP Cameroon partners. In that realm, participants pleaded for curricula aligned with employers' needs, more internships and sandwich courses, better academic orientation mechanisms,  but also the intervention of more professional experts inside academic institutions. The Ministry in charge of Higher Education has recently launched reflections in that area and AccLab is currently considering experiments to be carried out to support that initiative.- -Additional results will be published in the realm of another blog post and a new version of the questionnaire will be administered through UNDP Cameroon Facebook page and through other channels in 2021. As far as solutions are concerned, AccLab Cameroon has started preparing an Academic Orientation Fair scheduled to take place in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, early February. It will be an opportunity for pupils and students to ask universities and corporations the best advice for their studies and build career. The Lab will also leverage that event to test solutions able to improve career counseling and information sharing around job opportunities. We hope that those solutions will help students to avoid the long, complex and unsuccesful job search that Arnaud, our participant, had to face a few years ago.- -All our thanks to Euphrasie Kouame, our Accelerator Lab focal point, who provided invaluable contributions to this piece.

However, the low-lying Delta is also extremely vulnerable to rising sea-levels and other consequences of climate change.-Our Accelerator Lab team set out to explore what can be done to help the small farming communities in the Delta facing the loss of their livelihoods due to sea-level rise and the salination of the soil.-We started our journey by collaborating with the Desert Research Centre, which is a public research-centre working together with UNDP Global Environmental “Small Grants Programme”, on “climate smart” crops.-The experts organized for us four ethnographic visits to the area, from which we were informed of two main challenges facing farmers: soil salinity and the use of sewage water as the main source of irrigation for 60% of farmland. These and other factors lead to reducing crop yields that threaten the livelihoods of smallholders. This is why the Centre is focused on developing new types of ‘climate smart’ crops.-Then we complemented our sensing phase by holding a series of interviews with agribusinesses and NGOs working on agricultural development to gain a better understanding of the challenges involved.-All of our interviewees highlighted the difficult situation facing smallholders in the Delta region. Farmers are often trapped in long-term debt cycles, for example, because they buy all their agricultural inputs on credit and don’t have much choice over the price, they sell their products for, nor whom they sell to.-Another vulnerability for farmers stems from the fact there are many market players between farmers and end-consumers, with farmers being the most vulnerable and lowest paid actors within long and complex value chains.-We also learned from our interviewees that current contract farming models are not the best and that cooperatives and farmers’ unions have only enjoyed limited success in empowering farmers to gain greater market access and a greater role in decision-making.-Based on the data we had collected, we then conducted a behavioural analysis of the key bodies involved in agriculture in the Delta, a socio-economic analysis of local farming communities, and a behavioural analysis of the value chain market players for opportunistic crops.- -Behavioural Analysis of Key Bodies-We analysed the behaviour of the key bodies affecting farmers in the Delta, including agricultural cooperatives, local arbiters, water management institutions and farmers’ unions, with the objective of understanding their format and scope, being a strong tool to enhance market entry and empower decision making capacities for small farmers.-What we found from this analysis was that none of these key bodies currently play any role in the marketing of crops or in resolving conflicts arising from farming contracts. Instead, the main internal conflicts handled by these bodies stem from issues concerning water scarcity, especially among farmers. The support these bodies provide to farmers is further limited due to their lack of resources, including understaffing.- -Socio-Economic Analysis of Delta Communities-We also conducted a series of focus groups and surveys with vulnerable communities in the Delta. In doing so, our aim was to gain a better understanding of their incomes model, levels of education, their main sources of information and their current understanding of the impacts of climate change on crops and livestock.-We identified two prevalent models of income: 1) day-to-day income in the form of revenues from livestock, poultry, or dairy products; and 2) seasonal income from agriculture. Farmers tend to save this seasonal income for paying off their agricultural debts or – if possible – for major expenditures like marriages or buying a new house or new livestock.- -Education-We found that there are less and less graduates in the Delta who are interested in pursuing higher education or careers in agriculture. Farming is widely considered by young people as hard work for low pay.- -Awareness of climate change impact-Farmers are aware of the impacts of climate change on their livelihoods. Heat waves, strong winds and soil salinity were identified as the three main factors adversely affecting their crops and livestock, often resulting in loss of quantity and quality, as well as the emergence of new crop diseases.- -Communications and sources of information-Regarding communications, 51% of the people in the communities we surveyed said that the most effective communications channel for them was ‘word of mouth, while 44% get most information from television. Social media came last on the list of sources of information.- -Behavioural Analysis of Value Chain Market Players-The final step in our exploration journey was to understand the market of the most opportunistic crop as well as that of the most opportunistic animal product, by conducting interviews with their value chains actors.-We identified them by identifying the amount of revenue farmers make from them, the amount of costs, number labour entailed and their levels of water consumption, as well as their current and predicted climate change resilience We also looked at predicted future demand for different types of crops and animal products.-Wheat was identified as the most opportunistic crop, while dairy products were identified as the most opportunistic animal product.- -Wheat-Wheat-growing farmers are currently obliged to deliver their output to state-owned mills, which then distribute 70% to the public sector for bread and pasta, while the remaining 30% of wheat goes to the private sector. Essentially there is a downstream government monopoly on wheat.-The niche markets for pasta and bakeries use durum wheat, which cannot be grown in the Delta. These markets import 80% of durum wheat from abroad while getting 20% from farmers in Upper Egypt, i.e. from the south of the country.- -Dairy products-Seasonal factors have a strong impact on the value chain for dairy products in Egypt, with all actors in this chain reporting a 30% reduction in the quality and quantity of these products in summer compared to winter, with a corresponding reduction in prices and revenues. This seasonal loss is due primarily to the absence of any green feed crops grown in the summer months - unlike the availability of clover in winter.-The low quality of dairy products and the inability of smallholders to afford pasteurization units constitute major barriers to farmers in accessing supermarkets, hotels, and restaurants.- -Smart crops of the future-Finally, we explored which would be the best climate smart crops to grow in the future to ensure sustainable agricultural practices.-The Desert Research Centre has recommended a range of climate smart crops based on their climate-resilient characteristics. We selected from these the crops most resistant to heat, wind, and salinity. Our selection criteria further included considerations about the amount of water needed for different crops and the marketing opportunities of these products. In addition, we identified which crops had the most value chain opportunities.- ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 1  No poverty,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 13  Climate action,Engy Abdel Wahab,Egypt,Press release"

Each team came from a different background and approached the challenge from a different perspective, from portable nano-biosensors for rapid soil analysis to using moringa seeds for sewage water purification.- -Three days of innovation-The three-day hackathon gave participants the opportunity to attend consultation sessions with leading mentors from the field and introduced them to key tools in design-thinking approaches to solutions.-On the final day of the hackathon, the teams presented their ideas to a panel of experts from UNDP Egypt, IWMI MENA, the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development, and the Academy of Scientific Research and Technology.-The team’s proposed solutions were assessed according to their impact, feasibility, sustainability, and innovation.-The winning teams and solutions were as follows:-Team AquaMeter proposed a digital platform that allows fish-farming producers to maximize and organize their production process through data analytics.  -Team Vita proposed enhancing soil properties through the use of microalgae as biofertilizers and biopesticides.-Team SunRes proposed bringing together PV solar energy with agriculture to increase yield production and save water from evaporation.-Team Algaenoor proposed pairing inland desalination plant with algae farms and using salinity-tolerant algae for the remediation of the rejected brine generated by the desalination of groundwater aquifers.","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Blog post,Goal 13  Climate action,Alik Mikaelian,Egypt,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs"

And this socio-economic vulnerability has been rendered even made worse over the past two years by fluctuations in the local and global markets due to the pandemic.-The UNDP Accelerator Lab team in Egypt have been talking with smallholders on the ground to explore innovative solutions to help farmers gain greater stability and improve their incomes while at the same time adopting more sustainable practices.-Worldwide, development agencies and experts are also looking into ways of integrating small-scale farmers into global and domestic markets and of including smallholders in the development process.-This is because increasing farmers’ participation in markets would expand their choices and enable them to make more informed and free decisions on how and what to produce and how to invest in their farms, their families and themselves.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 1  No poverty,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Egypt,Yomna Mohamed,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs"

It was an intended opportunity to engage with the ecosystem, acknowledge our presence, and open room for inspiration, synergies, and collaborations. You will always hear our team talk about accelerating learning, disrupting how we do development, and changing obsolete discourse. That’s a huge responsibility which we absolutely take very seriously and were keen to reflect that from day one!-Easier said than done! We started by building a conscious design for all our launching activities that aims to lead by example.-Commit to our values to be Inclusive and empowering-In the urban fabric of old Cairo’s small alleys, we kick-started our launching activities. “Bayt Yakan” (translated as the house of Yakan), an architectural treasure renovated into a community center. This is where we gathered a diverse group of people to have our first conversations on signals of change: any development, idea or innovation that points to a future possibility different to today's norm. The place is an empowering location that sits at the center of local communities and tells a story of commitment and connectivity.-There, we had deliberate-on-camera conversations with a diverse group of people, who are change leaders in their respective domains and influential voices among their followers. They represent not only different sectors but also, different players in the ecosystems. Between civil society, private sector, community building, and entrepreneurs, those six champions had more than half a million followers collectively through various social media channels. It was exciting to see what conversations can intersect when we get such a diverse group to re-imagine development together. A conversation starter for numerous ideas to explore and experiment. Moreover, people got to hear terms like signals of change, experimentation, and acceleration through familiar voices that can help build a new narrative. Followed by an open survey, this conversation did not stop there but was an open call for everyone to contribute and see their role in building a better future.- -Apply the narrative of collective intelligence and collective action-Collective intelligence is about harnessing insights, ideas, information through an orchestrated engagement with people and technology to achieve a goal, in our case, accelerating sustainable development. Collective action is about working toward that goal, together. Our launch campaign intended to show a glimpse of what we mean when we talk about collective intelligence and collective action.-If we want to re-shape development and respond to future calling, we needed to ask big questions: which signals of change happening today around us can guide more sustainable future scenarios? How can we capture those signals and use them to create change? First, we reached out to people, government, private sector, and civil society for answers. Collectively we gathered actionable insights on education, health, technology, labor, tourism, and development at large. Departing from that, we aligned our launch event agenda with that big picture. For example, the launch event had a highlight session with Her Excellency Minister of International Cooperation Dr. Rania El Mashat focusing on the power of collective intelligence and collective action from a policy maker’s perspective. Facilitated by one of our own Gina Lucarelli, Team leader UNDP Accelerator labs, this turned into a harmonized conversation on acceleration and learning, with a local flavor.-Seize every opportunity to approach complexity with learning-You might know by now that UNDP Accelerator Labs operate through what we call learning cycles. We start anything we do with a learning question. From that point, we sense around that question, explore challenges and opportunities, design solutions, and test them. This official launch was a space for learning, not only for the audience but for us as well.-With a new discourse, we questioned which medium can best help us deliver our message? So, we decided to diversify and test with our pre-launch activities. Between published video interviews, static content, virtual webinars, and anonymous surveys we were able to collectively reach around 90,000 people through social media and across various channels to date. We traced a significant peak with humanized content that guided our post launch campaign for wider engagement with our ecosystem.-We finally asked for our virtual launch, how can we best unbox our approaches and explain them to the audience in such short amount of time? In our last blog, we talked about the power of “show don’t tell”, and that is what we decided to do. The wealth of learnings we encounter through our global Accelerator Lab network is inspiring and humbling. It was the perfect venue to invite fellows from the region’s accelerator labs to share real life examples on what we mean when we talk about solutions mapping, exploration, and experimentation. Insights and stories from Tunisia, Sudan, Lebanon, and Iraq that helped bring in a clearer picture to our partners but also to colleagues in our own country office.-We might have just officially launched, but UNDP Egypt Accelerator lab is already busy as for the past five months probing one of the most pressing sustainable development challenges in our local context “socio-economic resilience in the face of climate change”. From day one, we got into action mode, trying to apply innovative approaches and methodologies brought in through the Accelerator labs global network. In upcoming blog posts, we will be telling you more about that, and meanwhile, the time is for building synergies, forging partnerships, and taking actions.-We invite everyone to share local solutions, ideas, and collaboration interest tapping into collected signals of change and imagined scenarios to experiment and grow- together.",[],"Egypt,Blog post,Yomna Mohamed,Accelerator Labs"

It is left to another member of the family to take care of that person—even as they have to negotiate a big new contract for their company.-Who is that person?-We at UNDP in Egypt put this riddle to 13 different people, male and female, ages 12-60. The occasion is International Women’s Day, 8 March, which this year UNDP is marking with the theme, “Women in Leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 World.”-70 percent of them said it was a man—the father or an adult son. Only a man, they said, was likely to be in such a job role.-Why did they feel that way? People we talked with attribute their answers to traditional views on the roles of women as caretakers and men as breadwinners. If a father was taking care of the family, then it would be only to step in for a sick wife and mother.-Unconscious bias-As soon as we meet someone, we may make judgements about them based on their age, accent, weight, gender, race, or other characteristics. Much of the time we’re not even aware of it.-That some 70% of people assumed the CEO in our story was a man suggests that such bias runs deep. Indeed, we might all be riddled with unconscious bias, especially towards women in the workplace and in leadership positions.-For Dr. Renee Navarro of the University of California in San Francisco, “Unconscious bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.” Its impact is devastating.-The fact that men are generally perceived as better leaders, even by women, reinforces the biases that have implications for the status of women in the workplace and positions of power. “I don’t know why I didn’t see myself in that story” says CEO and university lecturer, Yassmine Hassan. “I just felt that it would be the father in the family.”-Academic studies compiled by researchers at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School showed that the salaries of blonde women were 7% higher than those of brunettes or redheads, that 'mature-faced' people had a distinct career advantage over 'baby-faced' people, and that both male and female scientists were more likely to hire men, rank them higher in competency than women, and pay them $4,000 more per year than women.-Despite the remarkable increase in women entering the global workforce, women are still underrepresented in positions of responsibility, power, and leadership. Data from UN Women shows that 119 countries have never had a women leader. In addition, data from 133 countries shows that women constitute 2.18 million (36%) of elected members in local deliberative bodies, and only 14 countries have achieved 50% or more women in cabinets.-Out of all interviewees, the quickest to answer was 13-year-old Jana Rabie. With no hesitation she answered, “It’s the mother.” Jana had a role model. “I see my mother who has worked all her life and is very successful but also takes care of me and my family,” she says. “This is what I am used to at home.”-Jana aspires to own a company one day while following her dream of singing on the side.-If bias is learned—can it be unlearned?-Change is happening, but conscious and consistent effort is needed.  -In Egypt, a new law says that at least one out of ten members of the Senate must be women, and the constitution has been amended to require that at least 25 percent of members of the House of Representatives be women.-Direct government interventions ensure the increased participation of women in public life, improves diversity in the workplace, and works to close the gender gap, but a whole-of-society approach is also needed to make a deeper impact. Unconscious biases can be untangled through public education and open community dialogue.  -The malleability of these biases was apparent with interviewee Khadijah Muhammad, who was quick to believe the character was the father but changed her answer halfway through the discussion. “I jumped to the conclusion that it was a man, because that is what we were told growing up!” But, thinking through it, “I changed my answer.”-Through education and community dialogue, we might all change our “answers” on unconscious bias.-Learn more about how women’s equal participation and leadership in political and public life are essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.",['Icon of SDG 05'],"Noran Said,Goal 5  Gender equality,Egypt,Gender equality,Blog post,English"

To get there, stakeholders across the region need to listen to women in all their diversity and support women to make their voices heard.-Today is International Women’s Day, and this year’s theme is Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world. The theme celebrates the enormous contributions women and girls have made around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.-It is a theme that is highly relevant in the Arab States region, where women have stood at the front lines of combatting the crisis, be it through their work in the health and social sectors, as essential workers, or their contributions in communities and family life.  The crisis has underscored both the centrality of their contributions, often invisible, and the outsized burdens women carry, as they have been stretched thin through their efforts while also bearing the brunt of social and economic impacts – in a region where even before the crisis, women in the region have been hit by the highest regional unemployment rate in the world, at 41.8 per cent.-Women leading for change-Globally, the crisis has shown that countries with women in positions of national leadership have been relatively successful in the tough battle to stem the tide or mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. The same holds true at local levels or across different types of institutions, with women’s organizations demonstrating their skills and knowledge to secure better outcomes for people and communities.-While the Arab States region has not enough women in decision-making positions in the public sector, there has been no shortage of strong examples of women leaders at all levels pushing for change over the course of the pandemic. -In Jordan, women’s groups successfully lobbied to have child-care vouchers distributed as part of COVID-response social protection, in a step towards recognition of the economic value of care work. -In Morocco, women’s groups engaged the Ministry of Justice to roll out innovative programmes that enabled women to safely report domestic violence and access support. -In Libya, a network of women’s peacebuilders spread awareness of COVID-19 through radio stations, and teamed up with a legal aid network to provide masks to inmates, distribute food and provide information to vulnerable migrant and refugee communities.- In Djibouti, the Ministry of Women persuaded the Ministry of Budget to slash taxes on feminine hygiene products, diapers and infant formula to zero.-Women driving results-What these examples underscore is that where women of all walks of life have a seat at the table, or are able to make their voices heard, the result can be decisions, policies and laws that work better for all. Looking ahead, the key is to fully leverage the potential of women’s leadership in pandemic preparedness and response, first and foremost by listening to women and girls and engaging their insights in policy and programme development, including women with disability, who have been hit harder by the pandemic - while also moving to scale.-Across the Arab States region, and with support from core donors, UNDP works closely with partners and supporting institutions to listen to women’s voices, and to facilitate spaces at all levels for women from all backgrounds and contexts to make their voices heard. An example of this is a global sensemaking exercise that UNDP in the Arab States region initiated to capture the voices of grassroots women, peace and security advocates around the world on their role in economic and political decision making, to drive forward the Women, Peace and Security agenda.  Similarly, our Gender Justice and the Law initiative with UN Women,  UNFPA and ESCWA took into account perspectives of women leaders across the region, and our Regional Elections Project has partnered with the Organization of Arab Election Management Bodies to launch the Arab Network For Women in Elections. At the country level, UNDP is working in Jordan and Lebanon on initiatives to explore and promote positive masculinities, in light of increases of gender-based violence across the region.  And work is underway to support women supporting communities in crises and fragility settings,  such as an initiative to support a group of women in Yemen to set up and manage solar-powered mini-grids – providing affordable renewable energy to the local community in a country where half the population has no access to electricity, and at the same time creating economic opportunity for women.-Walking the Talk – With Women-UNDP also seeks to lead by example. Across the region, we have reached gender parity at senior levels within our own ranks.  Yet we must continue to engage more and more diverse women at every level of our work – so that our work continues to become more reflective of the good ideas of women of all backgrounds in our ranks and in the societies we serve. I strongly identify with the priority of supporting women within our ranks because it rings true with my own experience. I began my career as a National Officer in UNDP Algeria, and I have found within the United Nations a universe of opportunities to grow professionally, contribute ideas and serve the cause of sustainable and inclusive development.-An example just in from one of our Country Offices in the region makes clear the link between engaging women internally and in our work: During the early stages of the pandemic, a group of women staff at UNDP Tunisia County came together virtually to brainstorm priority ideas to support women across the country hit hard by the  pandemic.  The resulting initiatives provided targeted and rapid support for business continuity of women-headed small businesses, support for value chains benefitting 850 women entrepreneurs, and the kick-off of discussion on a strategic partnership with a large private-sector company to promote women’s entrepreneurship in the COVID-19 context and beyond. The colleagues recognized that the ideas would not have come to fruition had they not taken it upon themselves, with management support, to forge a way ahead.  It is one example, but one of many across the Arab States region—all of which started with listening to women and enabling women to lead.",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,Women's empowerment,Khalida Bouzar,Blog post,Arab states"

He explains that the word innovation derives from the Latin word innovationem, used as a noun of action – “a new idea, device, or method” – in the 16th century. Until then, “novators” were treated with suspicion. In the 19th century, French sociologist, Gabriel Tarde noted that social change required the stimulus of innovative thought. Innovation signified an act of disruption creating new opportunities for emerging segments of the population. And in the 20th century, innovation became identified with market innovation. It shifted from a quality of thought to an intellectual commodity. Innovation was required for increased economic efficiency. It was something to produce and possess.  -If we take a closer look, we will see that innovation advocates and active communities are not only building exciting things but and are also constantly adding new terminologies to the dictionary. This glossary is rapidly evolving at a pace faster than regular people can assimilate. Terms like “co-creation”, “design thinking”, and more recently, “future foresight”, “positive deviance”, and “collective intelligence”. Yes, the world is evolving that fast, but can this be a little too much?-Beware of red flags-This linguistic evolution, in itself, is a signal of change, and change lies at the center of innovation. It is a healthy sign that we are advancing intellectually and paving the way to doing things differently. Yet, we really need to stop and think if this is becoming jargon that makes the act of innovation more elusive and exclusive. After all, the language barrier is the kernel of communication challenges.-So, what does that mean for the promise of “Acceleration”? As UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab’s journey kicks off, our mission is to be a fast-learning network on sustainable development challenges and catalysts for change. UNDP Accelerator Labs provide partners with new approaches to address development problems unleashing the power of local innovations, collective intelligence and experimentation. This means that we start asking unusual questions, experiment with new approaches, and introduce new concepts that usually involve progressive discourse and non-traditional terminologies.-But what if we started speaking a language no one is relating to? The risk of falling into the trap of semantics, sophisticated terminologies, and untied links was a red flag caught early on. When people speak different languages, it is a two-way break in communication, which can interrupt any velocity before it picks up.",[],"Innovation,Agenda 2030,Egypt,Blog post,Yomna Mohamed,Accelerator Labs"

The objective was to understand their barriers to formal markets.-Through the collective intelligence workshop  we learnt that rural MSMEs face many challenges that force them to remain in the cottage industry sector . For instance, before registration at the Ministry of Commerce Industry and Trade, they have to fulfil the requirements of operating a business on Swazi Nation Land such as getting a consent letter from the chief and spending on ‘facilitation fees’ that they could be investing in the business. We also learnt that MSMEs who are interested in agro-processing face several barriers to getting their products into formal retail markets. For example, an MSME said he has not received a quality standard certification from Eswatini Standards Authority (SWASA) because it costs about E150,000.00 ($10,000), which is unaffordable to most MSMEs.-Upon learning about these challenges, the AccLab, working with SEDCO, started a journey of finding solutions through a Buy Eswatini Campaign. The idea is to develop localized and accessible solutions that make it easier for the small agro-processors to get into mainstream markets. The objective of this campaign is to introduce policy and regulatory changes that allow the small businesses to thrive and compete with their well-established counterparts.-We are working with two groups; women and youth, from the Shiselweni Region involved in honey and cayenne pepper processing, to experiment with solutions to the barriers. The Shiselweni Women Processors, an association of 20 members processing cayenne pepper completed a training recently on setting up a quality management system for their plant. Through this process, a quality management manual for MSMEs was developed after which the association produced its first chilli sauce called Lilangabi, which is professionally branded.-We are also working with ESWADE to support a youth group, Magele Honey. Through working with the two groups, we hope to develop a model that can be adopted by other MSMEs who want to take their products to the retail outlets’ shelves. The AccLab is also working- with the Regulatory and Quality Infrastructure Department under the Ministry of Commerce Industry and Trade to explore ways to domesticate or produce a local product certification scheme that will be more accessible to MSMEs. We are working with a few retailers in this experiment to ensure that there is an increase in the number of local brands in big retail outlets. The aim is to bring about policy changes that enable better penetration of local products and a good representation of these in local retail shelves.-tapping into experiences of countries like Kenya, we’ll work with retailers to get Eswatini to a stage where many products found in retail markets are locally produced. Lilangabi and Magele Honey are just one of the ways the AccLab learns by doing and, thereby, produce actionable knowledge to programming that supports the country reduce women and youth unemployment, while contributing to UNDP’s Country Program Document (CPD) Output 1.2 – improving agricultural value chains.- ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Eswatini,Solutions Mapping,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 5  Gender equality,English,Accelerator Labs"

At face value, addressing one challenge seems to create another, as in the case of eliminating single-use diapers in favour of reusable nappies.-The contribution of single-use diapers in reducing the burden of reproductive responsibilities on women and allowing them to save time cannot be ignored. However, the advance towards single-use diapers has also contributed to several environmental setbacks, especially in areas without adequate waste collection systems. Disposable diapers are not only a public nuisance, but they also pollute surface water and are sometimes ingested by livestock. They also clog drainage systems, and pose a number of health risks. Therefore, solving this challenge without applying a gender lens is likely to raise concerns among advocates for gender equality and it could cause setbacks in work done to ease the burden for women raising children.-From a cultural perspective, childcare and maintaining good sanitation, such as managing diaper waste, is usually the sole responsibility of women. As such, any sustainable solution that promotes the use of reusable alternatives must bear this in mind. As we aim to investigate the most gender-responsive solution, we have conducted Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with a diverse group of women. Those women have identified reusable nappies as the most suitable solution to mitigate the negative environmental impact in peri-urban and rural communities where adequate waste collection systems are almost non-existent.-From the perspectives of the FGDs participants, single-use diapers do not affect only the environment, but also the incomes of women and the health of their babies. Therefore, a holistic, gender-sensitive approach must be considered. One of the issues raised by the FGDs was that single-use diapers are expensive, and the money spent on them could be used to provide for other childcare needs such as food, health, or saving for education. Indeed, according to the South African Cloth Nappy Association, on average, a child will use $1,100 (E15,000.00) worth of disposable nappies by the time they are potty trained, compared to an average cost of $250 (E3500) for cloth nappies. The FGDs attested to this observation that many young women would rather ensure that single-use diapers are available first before worrying about other baby needs.-A survey carried out by UNDP Eswatini Accelerator Lab that mapped 610 households found that 37 percent of infants and toddlers under the age of three live in low-income households that receive an average of less than $32 (E500) per month.  The survey further found that parents who are low-income earners are spending a large portion of their money on diapers. For instance, 94 percent of households earning below $ 32 (E500) were found to use single-use diapers and, of these, 51 percent were found to spend between ($ 3.15 – $10 E50 - E150), while 38 percent spend between $ 10 – $19 (E151 and E300) on disposable diapers. This means that low-income earners who receive below $32 (E500), spend up to 60 percent of their direct incomes on single-use diapers.-Cloth nappies provide a cheaper option to their disposable counterparts and they are friendly to the environment. For example, in Eswatini, the cost of one cloth nappy can be as low as $2.00 (E30.00) and with over 96 percent of the infants surveyed, using up to five nappies per day, this becomes a cheaper alternative, no matter how many are needed. The UNDP Eswatini Acc. Lab is currently running an experiment with 80 caregivers in five communities under the Ludzeludze Inkhundla to learn more about the practicability of a transition to much more environmentally friendlier options such as cloth nappies to reduce waste.-Although the debate on baby sanitary wear options continues, and it is not limited to the cost, disposable diapers have proven to harm the environment especially in developing countries like Eswatini.-(Nontobeko Mlangeni is the Head of Solutions Mapping at UNDP Eswatini Acc.

Therefore, I strongly believe that young people should be encouraged and supported to use their youthful exuberance and ingenuity to create viable business enterprises.-The youth can start businesses based on new ideas and try out new models in producing different products and services. While this is true, despite their entrepreneurship skills, talent and the hunger to succeed, the youth does not get easy access to finance their start-ups. Banks and other financers traditionally do not finance “ideas”.-“The financing model for start-ups should be tailored differently from general business financing,” is how the Head of Development at Royal Science and Technology Park (RSPT), Sebenzile Dlamini, responded to my question on how start-ups could be transformed into successful enterprises.-This  makes sense to me for several reasons. Start-ups do not usually have solid business models. Their products and services are unknown in the market. Financial institutions generally want to see cashflows, turnovers and projections when appraising a business proposal for a loan.-Understandably, start-ups are at the stage where they are still experimenting and building up the product. Therefore, any financing vehicle must be flexible enough to support this development stage. Unfortunately, the reality is that mainstream financing institutions such as commercial banks are not of that flexibility, as they are always guarding against None Performing Loans (NPL) in their books. As a result, the uptake of guarantee schemes has generally been less than impressive in Eswatini. Banks’ rules and regulations still do not accommodate loan requests even when a guarantee scheme is available.-It gives me hope though that a partnership between UNDP and RSTP under the Pipeline Innovators and Entrepreneurs Programme, also known as Ematfuba Ami, has seen the success of at least two start-ups which have grown in leaps and bounds.  Both start-ups – ROCILE Investments and Smiling Through Investments – are owned and run by young people. They are both specialising in seed production and multiplication. They were selected to be among 16 youth entrepreneurs who were not only awarded seed capital, but they were also enrolled in an incubation programme with RSTP.-I had the privilege of talking to the directors of both companies. On the one hand, I learnt that since Smiling Through Investment received the grant of E135,000 (USD8 645), they have had E3.1 million (USD198 185) turnover since 2020 and after being able to use the grant to leverage E500,000 (USD31 963) credit facility from the Industrial Development Company of Eswatini (EIDC). On the other hand, ROCILE Investment, owned by two young women, received a grant funding of E165,000 (USD10 542) which it has used to gain access to both local and international markets. The money was used for product development including branding and packaging. As a direct result of the grant, financial institutions started to gain confidence in the start-ups which now had a more structured business model and a market-ready product.-I, therefore, believe that the UNDP and RSTP’s funding model seems to be working. We just need more resources to help start-up access grants. Initially, the programme was aimed at allocating the $100,000 (E1 565 245) UNDP funding to a private institution to issue loans to start-ups. However, owing to the high rate of NPL by young entrepreneurs, the blended approach of first having seed funding in the form of a grant for start-ups together with private financing seems to have been effective.-(Mavie Thwala is the Head of Exploration at UNDP Eswatini AccLab)","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Eswatini,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Design Thinking,English,Accelerator Labs"

As such, the development of value chains and market linkages remain somewhat an afterthought. However, awareness on the importance of value chains and market linkages has improved in recent times because of the economic gains associated with value addition.-I think there are several reasons why market penetration for agro-processed products is poor in developing countries including Eswatini. One of the most significant reasons is the lack of a proactive project design that considers closing the processing gap by not only improving productivity but also:-·       Exploiting the full value chain.-·       Linking products with markets.-It makes sense to integrate all three steps at the conceptual phase in a project design to ensure their seamless interconnectivity. There are intricate details of each step that must link with the next stage. For example, potato production for French fries must be responsive to market requirements given that the preferred variety is genetically different from any other potato. I strongly believe that the poor market linkage integration in project planning results in:-·       A lack of a market-responsive product variety.-·       Inadequate production to supply market demand.-·       Poorly structured market linkage.-Having observed these challenges, the UNDP Eswatini Accelerator Lab is on a journey to understand how prohibitive factors to market linkages such as value addition for agro-processed products can be addressed. The Lab has noticed that smallholder farmers mainly focus on production and barely consider value addition. Additionally, locally-produced agro-processed products seldom make it to the mainstream markets, yet they dominate the informal sector.-There are technical barriers that impede the market penetration of these products related to food health and hygiene. Those that attempt to add value to their products tend to use their home kitchens (cottage enterprises), which is a practice that is frowned upon because it does not comply with international standards for food health and hygiene.-Therefore, the Buy Eswatini Campaign has three components that are independently designed to work towards testing different technical solutions to understand the prevailing challenges. By partnering with a major retail outlet that has an Enterprise Supplier Development Programme (ESDP) and collaborating with government entities with a mandate to develop Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), the Buy Eswatini Campaign attempts to produce a blueprint to support agro-processors to overcome these technical barriers that impede market access.-1.      Enterprise Supplier Development-The AccLab has partnered with Pick N’ Pay (PnP), one of the major food retailers in Southern Africa, to launch a call for local agro-processors who qualify to enter the PnP ESDP. The selection criterion has been designed in collaboration with SEDCO, a parastatal that supports MSMEs. Qualifying applicants will be subsequently enrolled in the PnP ESDP and stand a chance to benefit from SEDCO’s incubation and business development support.-2.      Product Development Support-Working with the Home Economics Department (HED) under the Ministry of Agriculture and SEDCO, a group of women will be supported with production inputs and a processing facility. This will help this group to produce at a level commensurate with retail outlets’ standards. Again, this is meant to help the beneficiaries to comply with regulatory requirements and identify partners to work with in getting certified to access the formal market. -3.      Development of High Impact Agriculture Value Chains-We then structured the last component to approach market linkages from a value addition point of view. The Acc. Lab has partnered with Eswatini Water and Agricultural Development Enterprises (ESWADE) to identify a honey-producing group at Magele in the Shiselweni Region. This group will be supported with basic honey-processing equipment and technical support to add value to their produce. SEDCO has availed an incubation facility to be used for processing. PnP will be at hand to also enrol this product under their ESDP to provide branding and packaging support.- -(Mavie Thwala is the Head of Exploration at UNDP Eswatini AccLab.)","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Goal 1  No poverty,Eswatini,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Design Thinking,English,Accelerator Labs"

Lab last year changed the way single-use plastic bags are distributed by retailers across the country.  This resulted in major reductions in the amount of plastic bags distributed because they are now issued on only two days per week. Along with this experiment came a lot of public debate around issues of waste management.-While several waste streams are a challenge in the country, sanitary waste stood out, in particular, used disposable diapers. The perception survey which was undertaken as part of the Phatsa Sakho Nawe campaign also highlighted the need to find solutions to this challenge. This, along with the results of other past UNDP and Eswatini Environmental Authority (EEA) initiatives such as the  2016 Waste Indaba, justified the need to pursue this as one of the Lab’s frontier challenges for 2021. -The AccLab is building on some work that some organisations and communities have done on this issue. These organisations include Enactus – a tertiary student organisation focused on innovation, which worked with a small community in Kwaluseni to find solutions to manage the disposal of single-use diapers. The Royal Science and Technology Park has also done some work to map solutions to this challenge. -Towards a Circular Economy-With the country now moving towards a circular economy that promotes sustainable solutions for dealing with waste, the Lab was challenged to explore solutions higher up in the waste hierarchy when it came to disposable diapers. The hierarchy draws on the precautionary principle; in that reducing waste is likely to cause far less harm to people and the environment than putting it into landfill will. It prioritises the reduction of waste, then its reuse, recycling, recovery, and lastly, the optimisation of its final disposal. -The Sustainable Inclusive Economic Growth Portfolio in the Country Programme Document (CPD 2021-2025) for the Kingdom of Eswatini recognizes the need to promote a circular economy, which has the dual potential of creating new jobs and livelihoods while improving waste management. -UNDP aims to adopt a holistic approach whereby every type of waste is part of a closed-loop process chain, thus creating a sustainable value chain for the waste management economy. Building on the work initiated through the Phatsa Sakho Nawe Campaign, the Lab’s focus will be to support the promotion of a circular economy through the mapping and testing of solutions that are higher up in this hierarchy. Such solutions are not only beneficial to the environment but also have financial gains for users. For instance, reusable nappies, which may be considered one of the sustainable solutions to single-use diapers, tend to be cheaper in the long run. According to the South African Cloth Nappy Users Association for example, on average, one child will use disposable nappies to the total cost of over E15,000.00 ($1100) by the time they are potty trained, compared to an average cost of E3 500.00 ($250) for cloth nappies.   -The Challenge in Eswatini-Initial indications to understanding this challenge pointed to several issues:-1. Rural and peri-urban areas lack adequate waste collection systems. Diapers are currently disposed of indiscriminately in environmentally sensitive sites such as waterways, rangelands, etc. -2.  Lack of adequate solutions or technologies for appropriately disposing of single-use diapers.-3. Lack of sustainable options or solutions that fall higher up in the waste hierarchy. -4. An adequate solution should consider women because childcare and taking care of household duties is largely their responsibility.-5. Diapers have a low propensity for recycling and degradation – according to the World Wildlife Fund. They take over 500 years to decompose.-6. Lack of awareness on the impacts and possible solutions to this challenge-The Case for Sustainable Alternatives-Additionally, the high volumes of single-use diapers that are imported and their increasing affordability make them an attractive option even for low-income earners. According to Eswatini Revenue Authority (2021), over 70 tonnes of single-use diapers were imported in the last three years. Moreover, the 2017 National Census reveals that the country has 130 208 infants which could be within the diaper-wearing bracket (Central Statistical Office). With the cost of a single-use diaper going for as little as E2.00 ( $0.14) each, an increasing number of mothers/caregivers are using them. Observations from informal peri-urban households show the high use of disposable diapers even for low-income earners who earn an average salary of E15 00.00 (~US$ 100) per month.-According to the South African Cloth Nappy Users Association, a child will use 4 140 disposable nappies and generate almost a ton of waste (952kg) by the time they are potty trained. With the number of children of diaper-wearing age in the country, the call for more sustainable options is very urgent. -Moreover, used disposable diapers may contain viruses and microbes which can cause public health problems if they are leached out from illegal dumpsites into the soil and water. According to the World Health Organization, used diapers should first be rinsed before being discarded to ensure that raw human waste does not get disposed of in landfills and other disposal sites. It is doubtful if any consumers follow these guidelines.-Solutions Mapping and Experimentation-The AccLab plans to use an ‘innovation challenge call’ to map solutions to address the waste from used disposable nappies. The aim is to unearth solutions that provide alternative, affordable and sustainable options as demonstrated in the Phatsa Sakho Nawe Campaign. The idea is to set up an experiment with two groups of mothers/caregivers - one will be the control group which will continue to use disposable nappies and the other an experiment group that will use re-usable nappies. The aim is to learn and identify the levers of change that would drive the adoption of more sustainable options to the single-use diaper.  -(Nontobeko Mlangeni is the Head of Solutions Mapping at UNDP Eswatini’s Acc.

In the process, we learnt about the economic dynamics of the cottage industry where a variety of interesting products are created for the local market. These products include, but are not limited to, jams, sauces, peanut butter and soaps.  Interestingly, although some of the products are indigenous, they have become scarce or are forgotten due to modern lifestyles and/or urban migration. These products are also believed to have many unique health benefits because they are indigenous and they provide the market with feelings of childhood nostalgia.-The local cottage industry seems to be the backbone of the economy but it hasn’t been well researched. While in many countries across the world the industry has been found to play a significant role in contributing to livelihoods and rural development through job creation, in Eswatini it is still underdeveloped. This is an interesting fact considering that the kingdom is among countries with the highest rates of poverty, inequality, and unemployment in the world. It is therefore worth taking a closer look at the local industry to gather some insights.-Observations of cottage industry Eswatini-The Ministry of Agriculture’s Home Economics Department has played a significant role in empowering rural and urban communities with basic food processing and preservation, carpentry and soap-making skills. The department motivates people through programmes that emphasize the value of “sustainable livelihoods”. Through its programmes, some community members formed women groups to manufacture products ranging from peanut butter, sauces, jams and liquid soaps to yield benefits of ‘collective capacity’ and to boost income. However, over the years it has been noted that the training attracts participants with a low business acumen to drive the commercialization of their products at a large scale. This means that participants of such programmes tend to use their acquired skills and products for domestic purposes and sell the little that is left to neighbors. As such, there is a need to find ways to attract unemployed youth and ensure that programmes offered include technical guidance on basic industrial processing and business administration at the cottage industry level.-With the growing popularity of social media marketing, several cottage industry products have emerged. A significant portion of the products is also agro-processed goods such as sauces, jams, coffees, bakery, confectionary, domestic liquid soaps, skincare and grooming products.  This trend is interesting because Eswatini cottage industries have mostly been dominated by handicraft, textile, interior decorations, meat and dairy products, and construction products (welding, bricks etc.). The individual product suppliers seem to be mostly from urban to peri-urban areas with a clear business interest, as some have online stores for their products.-Some of the challenges faced By Cottage Industries in Eswatini-The industry faces intense challenges in designing marketing strategies, accessing finance to invest in equipment, raw material supply chain management, product development and preservation, and meeting food processing standards requirements. Meeting food safety standards requirements  appears to be the main barrier for growth and sustainability for the cottage industries particularly those that process edible products. This is because meeting food safety standards is a  key requirement for both formal local retail outlets and export markets. In Eswatini, like in most of the Sub-Saharan countries, the predominant form of retailing is formal. Shopping centres and malls are the main market access points for fast-moving consumer goods. While this phenomenon is good, the strict formal retailing requirements are a market access barrier for  Micro Small and Medium Enterprises, who are still at the cottage industry level.  Nonetheless, a lot can be learnt from other African economies, such as Kenya, which have endorsed cottage industry policies that have improved access to the market for these products.-Most cottage industries in Eswatini face poor market perceptions. A young fashion designer shared that “the local market doesn’t want to pay us well because the consumer’s expectation is that since I am a local and have made the garment from my cottage business, where I don’t pay rent and etc., I should sell at a lower cost’’. Some local artisans also share this view, as such, they struggle to find a local market that appreciates and values their products, skills, quality, and the time that goes into making the product. As a result, some choose to use cheaper product inputs to manage costs at the expense of quality.-The inability to form groups among individual cottage businesses that manufacture the same product (especially in rural communities) is another challenge. This limits some cottage industries from reaping the benefits of economies of scale and attracting potential support from the Government, development agencies and venture capitalists to help contribute towards the scaling of their activities. This silo approach creates unnecessary competition among cottage businesses targeting the same market segment, leading to limited progression in these businesses.-Buy local, Buy Swazi-Local flea markets and promotional events and campaigns that support the consumption of local products, under the mantra of ‘buy local’ or ‘support local’ or ‘go local’ can play a pivotal role in the promotion of cottage products. Such a campaign could serve as a platform that brings together cottage industrialists in Eswatini, with the long-term goal of changing the narrative that has a perennial dependence on imports of products that can be easily produced and manufactured in the country. During the Agriculture Indaba on 17th June 2021, the Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Jabulani Mabuza, said “let us stop importing basic food commodities that can be produced locally, let us stop exporting money and jobs to other countries. Asidle kwetfu (let us consume our own) and keep our wealth and jobs.”  The challenge has been put on the table for us all.-            (Zandile Mthembu is the Head of Experimentation at UNDP Eswatini Accelerator Lab)

Founded in 2018 with the aim of boosting Africa’s trading position in the global market, trading under the AfcFTA started in January 2021.-To fulfil its mandate of supporting the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini to eradicate poverty by creating sustainable jobs, UNDP Eswatini is eyeing AfCFTA to allow local MSMEs access to the continental market.- -Partnership Agreement for COVID Recovery through Enhanced Trade-This follows the signing of the partnership agreement between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the AfCFTA Secretariat on March 29, 2021. The partnership agreement was signed by UNDP Regional Director for Africa, Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa, and AfCFTA  Secretary General, H.E. Mr. Wamkele Mene, who was accompanied by Ambassador Fatima Mohammed Kyari, Permanent Observer of the AU to the United States.-The aim of the partnership agreement is to promote trade as a stimulus for Africa’s socioeconomic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, and as a driver of sustainable development, particularly for women and youth in Africa, in line with the SDGs and Agenda 2063, Africa’s development blue print.-The agreement between the two parties came shortly after Ms. Eziakonwa’s virtual mission to the Kingdom of Eswatini on March 22-26  where she met with different partners including senior government officials such as the Acting Prime Minister, Senator Themba Nhlanganiso Masuku. She also participated in the launch of the new Country Programme Document (CPD) for the Kingdom of Eswatini 2021-2025.- -Addressing MSME Trade Barriers to Empower African Businesses-In light of these developments, UNDP Eswatini’s Resident Representative, Ms. Rose Ssebatindira, convened an engagement meeting between the country office and the Africa E-Trade Group (AeTrade) to discuss possible collaborations that could allow Eswatini traders access to the continental market under AfCFTA.-“At a global level, we’re already in partnership with the trade agreement and my team and I are very keen to see how this translates at a country level,” said Ssebatindira during the virtual meeting held on April 14.-AeTrade was formed 11 years ago by a group of Africans in the diaspora who collaborated with the AU in 2018 by signing a Memorandum of Understanding for a partnership to help businesses in the informal sector transition to formality in all 54 member states through digital means.-As noted by the UNDP staff, MSMEs in Eswatini, like their peers in other countries on the continent, face numerous structural barriers when trading within Africa, including high tariffs,  cumbersome customs processes, unreliable payment systems, breach of contracts and poor adherence to standards.-AeTrade works on  addressing these barriers. AeTrade Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson, Mr. Mulualem Syoum, told the UNDP Eswatini that streamlining and digitizing services will enhance trade within the continent. He said there should be a focus in the digital infrastructure to allow connectivity for the ease of doing business.-“Africa is the richest continent in the world, but we need the infrastructure to make the most of it,” he said, adding: “This will allow Africans to manage their own resources rather than having to export raw materials.”-He said the aim is to create 22 million jobs by enabling 600 000 entrepreneurs from African countries to access regional, continental and global markets.- -Connecting African Traders through the Sokokuu Market Place-Responding to the infrastructure challenge, AeTrade has created a practical online trade tool, Sokokuu Market Place. According to AeTrade Acting Chief Operations Officer, Ms. Treasure Maphanga, Sokokuu aims to enrol 2 500 MSMEs each year with a target of reaching 350 000 African subscribers.-Besides removing trade barriers and enabling the free movement of goods and services, AeTrade aims to introduce a digital lending platform within Sokokuu to give MSMEs affordable financing, said Maphanga.-“A digitally-connected Africa is here,” said Maphanga, who is also the Executive Director for the AU Trade Group Regional Headquarters for Southern Africa based in Eswatini. “This is an opportune time because COVID-19 has ignited digital trade such that being online is no longer a luxury but a development imperative.”- -A Model for Africa: Opportunities for E-Trade in Eswatini-Eswatini could be used as a model for other African countries through a potential partnership of mobilising resources to build the capacity of vendors enrolled in Sokokuu, said Maphanga.-Speaking at the same event, UNDP Strategic Advisor to the Regional Director for Africa, Ms. Joy Kategekwa, concurred, adding that Eswatini could benefit from AfCFTA by focusing on value addition and building the capacity of women and youth to become export entrepreneurs.-“UNDP country offices can help by surrounding themselves with partners who are helping the women and youth who are trying to export,” she said.-With a new Country Programme Document (CPD) in place, Kategekwa urged UNDP Eswatini to explore ways of positioning AfCFTA in the new five-year programme.-Ssebatindira echoed this, highlighting that AfCFTA provides a golden opportunity as the country is about to roll out the new CPD through new development programmes and projects.-“We have powerful partners and a lot of content and the challenge is how to narrow it down to what we can actually do,” she said.  -(Mantoe Phakathi is the Communication Specialist at UNDP Eswatini)","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Eswatini,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Launched in December 2020 with the aim of discouraging the use of single-use plastic bags to protect the environment, the campaign also presented a golden opportunity to entrepreneurs who are making the reusable shopping bags.-Vukani Bomake Project (VBP) is one of the business initiatives that took advantage of the resounding success of the campaign that was implemented by UNDP Eswatini’s Accelerator Lab in partnership with Eswatini Environmental Authority, the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, and the five major supermarkets in the country. VBP was established by Business Women Eswatini (BWE), under the wing of Business Eswatini, with the aim of equipping unemployed rural women with sewing skills so that they could start businesses within their communities. The project is currently working with 100 women drawn from five constituencies of Eswatini. Twenty of the women are working from Far East Textile Factory at Matsapha Industrial site while the rest are based at their constituencies.-According to BWE chairperson, Tokky Hou, the women are trained on various skills including mass production, business management, customer care and how to run a factory. However, Hou said it was difficult to implement the plan for VBP during the COVID-19 pandemic when many businesses had to close down owing to the impact of the partial lockdown that the Government of Eswatini imposed to curb the spread of the virus.-The Phatsa Sakho Nawe campaign, which begun on the first week of December 2020, presented an opportunity to the women under the project to make an income from supporting the campaign through the production of re-usable shopping bags. The initial idea was that shoppers would, for two months and on weekends , be expected to bring their own bags or buy the reusable bags available at the retail outlets. However, owing to the positive response from the public and retailers, the Minister of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Hon. Moses Vilakati, has extended the campaign indefinitely with an addition of two weekdays. This brought confidence in the sustainability of the campaign, thus allowing more Micro Small and Medium Enterprises to feel confident in entering the space.-“Vukani Bomake saw a niche in the campaign and partnered with the retailers to make shopping bags for their customers,” said Hou. “We are currently supplying four of the five partner retailers of the campaign with affordable multiple-use shopping bags.”  VBP produces up to 1800 shopping bags a week to try to keep up with the growing demand.-These multiple-use shopping bags are made from the waste generated by textile companies at the Matsapha Industrial Site. Instead of throwing away their waste, which used to end up in the landfill, the textile industry now supplies VBP with the scrap material. This means that the Phatsa Sakho Nawe campaign has also provided the country’s textile industry with a sustainable waste management option.  Apart from the shopping bags, the women also make reusable masks and sanitary towels. -The project is starting to bear fruit even at a household level, particularly to some of those who were affected by the scaling down of economic activity during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Sibongisile Dlamini (49) is one of the beneficiaries of VBP who suffered a major blow when her husband was retrenched in March last year. She had already lost her source of income after her sewing machine, which she used for making traditional women’s dresses (tidziya), broke down. Raising her six children while taking care of her elderly mother with no source of income proved to be a daunting task.-“I found it very frustrating not to know how we will pay for utilities and still have enough food,” said Dlamini.-Her misfortunes turned around when she was nominated to participate in VBP where she represented her constituency, Nhlambeni. “This project has positively changed my life because I’m now able to take care of my family and even invest into my indigenous chicken business,” said Dlamini. The beneficiaries get paid fortnightly like all textile workers but the aim is that they will return to their communities and create a textile hub that will supply the big factories.  -Dlamini wishes to empower more women and the youth to venture into the business of providing alternatives to single-use items because they harm the environment.-“In as much as it is gratifying to see people buying and carrying shopping bags sewn by me, it gives me even great pleasure to know that I am playing a significant role in protecting the environment”, she said. -Dlamini also said reusable bags ensure that the environment and rivers of Eswatini remain clean and that farmers do not lose more livestock upon the consumption of single-use plastic bags.-Sakhile Nsingwane is the Communication Officer at UNDP Eswatini’s Accelerator Lab.

The support, extended through the UNDP COVID-19 Rapid Financing Facility, is for the implementation of the Waste Management for Improved Livelihoods and Resilience Initiative in Eswatini. This project will also create business opportunities for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).-This support comes at a time when the country is currently witnessing the impact of Cyclone Eloise and the COVID-19 pandemic which is not only slowing development progress but also reversing gains made.-Addressing a virtual press conference on Feb. 18, UNDP Eswatini Resident Representative, Rose Ssebatindira, said it is important to integrate entrepreneurship and climate change actions to better mitigate and adapt to multiple shocks as an important green recovery pathway from COVID-19. The press conference was held jointly with the Minister of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Hon. Moses Vilakati.-“One of the most pressing issues facing the country, as it responds to the pandemic, is the management of COVID-19 waste,” Ssebatindira said, adding: “The disposal of used masks, testing kits and reagents require a management system that will prevent littering and re-infections while generating income.”-She said this initiative is in line with The Kingdom of Eswatini’s COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan and is designed to address the impacts of COVID-19 through innovative low-carbon solutions to enhance green economic recovery. It is also in line with UNDP’s inclusive economic growth strategy as outlined in the Country Programme Document (CPD 2021-2025), underpinned by the principle of “leaving no one behind”.-The Waste Management for Improved Livelihoods and Resilience Initiative takes advantage of lessons learnt from a UNDP-supported “Waste for Jobs” pilot project – at Matsapha Town Council – that benefited 114 households. It also draws inspiration from the no single-use plastic bag campaign, “Phatsa Sakho Nawe”, an initiative supported by UNDP and implemented by The Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs and the private sector, towards keeping Eswatini clean.-“There are indicative signs of positive behavioural change towards single-use plastic bags from this campaign as reported by Eswatini Observer, in its February 03 edition that ‘Vukani Bomake women project generated over E80 000 from the sale of reusable shopping bags, as an alternative to single-use plastic bags, in less than three months’,” said Ssebatindira.-In response, Vilakati acknowledge the challenge brought by COVID-19 to which the Ministry responded by setting up a committee to help mobilise climate finance available globally. This initiative is a result of one of the six proposals that were successful.-“This project will develop an inclusive strategy to strengthen waste sector policy, legislation, institutional coordination and capacity building,” said Vilakati.-He also said, among the outputs of the project, is a study that will form the basis for recyclable materials from household, commercial and industrial facilities to identify business opportunities in the waste management to attract more funding to the sector. The 18-month project has a strong bias towards women and the youth who form the largest group among MSMEs.-Mantoe Phakathi is the Communication Specialist at UNDP.

Lab in collaboration with Eswatini Environmental Authority (EEA) launched the Phatsa Sako Nawe (Bring your own bag) - Towards a plastic bag free Eswatini . The campaign seeks to advocate and address:  
--  The reduction in the distribution of single use plastic carry bags by major food retail outlets during the festive season;-- Raising awareness on the adverse effects of single use plastic bags on the natural environment;-- Encouraging the sale and use of multiple use carry bags to be possibly sourced from local textile MSMEs;-- Influencing the passing of Plastic Bag Regulations Bill in Parliament. The Bill advocates for the introduction of a plastic bag levy with an option of completely banning single use plastic bags.-The Lab, EEA and major food retail outlets undertook a solution mapping exercise to explore ways in which the distribution of single use plastic carry bags in Eswatini can be minimized. A partial ban strategy was agreed upon as an experiment.  The partial ban will entail retailers not issuing single use plastic bags from Friday to Sunday of every week for three-months starting from 4 December 2020. Shoppers will have the options of purchasing affordable multiple use carry bags or bring your own bag.-Eswatini has been grappling with the challenge of plastic waste pollution. A 2016 survey by the Eswatini Environmental Authority (EEA) indicated that three out of the five major retail distributed about 1.9 million single use plastic bags per month. Approximately 60% of these plastic bags are taken to landfills while the rest either pollute the aquatic ecosystem or the aesthetics of the natural environment. Domestic animals, considered in Eswatini to be a symbol of wealth especially for rural small holder farmers, have also been put at risk as they tend to ingest single use plastic carry bags while trying to forage on discarded food they contain.-Important to the eradication of single use plastic bags is behavioural challenge from both retailers and consumers. In Eswatini, there is no law that compels retailors to issue plastic bags, but rather this has been a goodwill practice by retailors in their quest of creating convenience to shoppers.-As part of monitoring behavioural change of consumers during the campaign, participating retailers will continue to give shoppers single use plastic bags as usual from Monday to Thursday of every week for the duration of the campaign. Data will be collected weekly on the number of plastic bags utilised and comparison will be drawn from baseline data. Secondly to encourage youth participation, an essay or poster competition will run throughout the two-month campaign. Qualitative data will be collected throughout on consumer feedback, complaints, and reaction to the campaign. -The experiment will also identify textile MSMEs in the country that can produce the cheapest multiple use shopping bags made from durable material with a high propensity to biodegradable. The idea is to create a local supply pipeline for multiple use shopping bags that will be a common feature for both retail outlets and consumers.-Single use plastic bag pollution has necessitated EEA to put together Plastic Bag Regulations’ Bill that currently awaits parliament approval. The bill is two pronged; first it introduces a levy on every single use plastic bag issued by retail outlets and it then provides an option for government to completely ban single use plastic bags. This phased approach is meant to allow both retailers and consumers to prepare for a complete ban of single use plastic bags.-Although the levy approach has proven to be effective in reducing the distribution of single use plastic bags by retailors, studies have shown that the effectiveness of the levy is price inelastic in the long run. The levy tends to create a cost shock for consumers in the short run that deters consumers from demanding plastic bags, but in the long run, the additional cost of the levy becomes negligible compared to the cost of the shopping basket. A complete ban of single use plastic bags is the most effective way of dealing with plastic bag pollution in the country. The partial ban introduced by the ‘Phatsa Sakho Nawe’ campaign will serve a practical example of the impact of the desired complete ban.-For more information contact;-Mavie Thwala – Head of Exploration - mavie.thwala@undp.org-Nontobeko Mlangeni – Head of Solutions Mapping  - nontobeko.mlangeni@undp.org-Zandile Mthembu – Head of Experimentation - zandile.mthembu@undp.org- - - ","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Climate change,Goal 15  Life on land,Eswatini,Blog post,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 14  Life below water,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Accelerator Labs"

While the enemy may seem invisible and surreal, the onus is now on us to take action in solidarity, and focus our combined efforts in doing all we can to protect one another, and ensure that we come out more resilient.-For the informal sector, this is probably one of the biggest challenges the sector will ever face. Between the lockdown and the looming economic downturn, this sector is staring right into the eye of the storm.-It is during this critical time that UNDP Eswatini through the Acc Lab is embarking on a journey to engage with this sector and map solutions for access to finance.-Assigned with the task to explore the informal sector in the COVID-19 pandemic and identify areas of intervention for UNDP, we found a wealth of information that shows how this sector is lagging in adaptive measures to external pressures such as those posed by COVID 19, and the capacity to absorb or tap into resources that are available to other Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs).-Informal employment is the main source of employment in Africa, accounting for 85.8 % of all employment (ILO, 2018). A majority of Emswati, 75%, earn their income from the informal sector or are depended on someone in the informal sector. Women constitute 65% and 25% are youth. 72% of those women are self-employed with a monthly salary of E719.00 (US$ 39.00). Informal Cross Border Trade (ICBT) contributes for 30-40% to intra-SADC Trade of which 70% of informal cross border traders are women (ILO, 2004). A study by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on Women in Informal Cross Border Trade (WICBT) in Southern Africa, including Eswatini, revealed that their trading activities are the main source of income for families - to buy food, pay school fees, health care services and rent, save in savings clubs and banks and reinvest in their businesses. This brings attention to the gender dimension, revealing the disadvantaged position of women and the need to empower them.-Eswatini like other countries has been affected by the lockdown including, curbing the informal sector, of their main source for livelihoods. When we engaged the sector, we quickly realised that they view things differently from mainstream society. While we are all faced with a health risk of COVID-19, they must, daily deal with health risks of the unsanitary workspaces. COVID 19 pandemic is not a top priority. Instead the highest risk is being unable to put food on the table.  -Some of the COVID 19 challenges highlighted include the following: loss of incomes and business due to prevailing lockdowns; spoilage of stock; lack of cashflow/ liquidity as money is locked in stock that was purchased prior to the lockdown; inability to service loans and other business related debts like rent and stock bought on credit; inability of cross boarder traders to access suppliers; exclusion from current relief programs for SMEs and for poor households; and increase in urban-rural migration as the increasing costs of staying in urban areas cannot be met without an income. This migration further poses a risk of spreading COVID-19 to rural areas.-The key aspects for the informal sector are issues of longer-term sustainability for the welfare of the sector. These include issues of legal validity of the sector as a contributor to the economy and therefore a valid form of employment, issues of the safety and welfare other members of this sector (not just from COVID 19), and issues of sustainable interventions aimed at promoting the sector.-As things are currently slow, the informal sector has chosen to focus on longer term challenges which have always affected this sector, including: financial exclusion; access to finance, especially the lack of documentation and  financial record history that would allow increased access to funding from micro lenders; the lack of tailored financial products; financial illiteracy; lack of appropriate infrastructure; including basic sanitary infrastructure; lack of participation in municipal planning and activities; lack of appropriate storage facilities for perishable goods; and lack of validation of the sector as a profession.-Following this sensemaking exercise, the Lab undertook a solution mapping exercise and found several solution developers, through reviewing the results of a hackathon organised by the financial services industry in 2019.-We are currently in the process of designing experiments and developing partnerships with one or two of these developers, aimed at providing business development services, including a platform for inventory management and record keeping for the provision of a financial record history to the informal sector. This experiment will also provide an online marketing platform, starting with the women who have stock for second-hand clothing, thus allowing for business continuity.-The Lab is also finalising the design of an experiment aimed at facilitating digital payments for the informal sector through mobile money platforms and linking these platforms with their income and expenditure records including their records in Stokvel activities. A stokvel is an informal savings pool where a group of individuals contribute a monthly amount and the group has full control of how they use that money. In many cases in the context of Eswatini, the informal sector funds its business capital through these Stokvels. Having a digital and authentic record of their activities (saving, borrowing and repayment of loans) in these Stokvels will provide an opportunity for a financial and credit record history for the informal sector which will (hopefully) enable them to get access to funding.-The Lab is looking at these experiments as part of value addition for the informal sector. The  lessons learned are envisaged to build the ability for the sector to recover and build better. As a Lab, we are still on a journey to learn more about the informal sector and how we can intervene to support its path to resilience.- ","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11']","Eswatini,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Blog post,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Sustainable Development Goals,Crisis response,Economic recovery,Accelerator Labs,English"

He was unfamiliar with the concept of public entrepreneurship and value creation as a public organization. While he saw himself and his job at the institute as innovative, translating that into a value proposition for the public was not straightforward until he participated in the training program developed by UNDP’s Innovation for Development project.-We cannot talk about building an innovation ecosystem without touching on the role of government as either a facilitator or a hands-on guide in setting the stage and building the infrastructure for entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems.-The government and its institutions need to be innovative as they build inter-governmental coordination, provide market-driven value to the public and take risks of innovations that the private sector can’t. Policies geared towards innovation building should be based on an understanding of the needs of the ecosystem and design strategies that are responsive.-Therefore, leaders and technical experts at government institutions need to build their capacity to create value to incentivize and support innovation.--"" If we see ourselves as experts in our fields but the ecosystem is still in the beginning stage, where is the disconnect since we are the ecosystem” Genet Zewde Researcher at Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute""-The solution -In Ethiopia, the Ministry of Innovation and Technology leads the government effort to promote the innovation ecosystem. With the support from KOCIA and FCDO, we collaborated with the ministry to provide capacity development for government institutions working in science and technology to be better positoned at championing and developing responsive policy around entrepreneurship and innovation.  -The training designed in partnership with the Entrepreneurship Development Institutions focused on government innovation actors to first understand how they can create value within their organizations through public entrepreneurship. The exercise tools helped participants understand, design and manage innovation ecosystem building strategies. In the past year, there have been seven rounds of training that have reached over 300 government staff. -The training has been very well received, and changed the minds of those who had been sceptical, like Dr Jelal. We had trainees lobby their senior management to extend the training to the institutional level, even to the level of regional government presidents. The technical teams went back to their institution and proactively created work plans based on what they learned and gotten approvals from their Head of Agency to put them into action.-What made it successful -The fame of this program has reached well beyond the reach of the ministry and affiliated institutions to the Ethiopian Tourism Organization and Addis Ababa City Education office looking to adopt the training program on value creation for their sector. The training program was successful because of the following reasons:-Methodology: Innovation is not a theory but a practice, so making the training as interactive as possible and focused on the public sector was crucial. Building in multiple opportunities to exercise on the job tools gave the trainees the practice they needed to be confident in implementing what they have learned in the real world. Genet Zewdie, a researcher at Ethiopia’s Biotechnology Institute, expressed, “We can see how to apply the training in our jobs fairly easily, and it brought a mindset change for me on the value and meaning of entrepreneurship”.-Design Framework: The program is framed in two parts; first is to improve organizational innovation capabilities internally to drive value creation at an institutional level. Second, it looks at how to take these capacities to create an active role in the ecosystem. By connecting organizational capacity with the ecosystem, the training drove home the need for collaboration and coordination commonly lacking in Ethiopia’s ecosystem. --What is next?-The progress made so far in developing the government institution’s capacity has been very successful, but we need a sustainable model that can make this training accessible to a larger audience and leave a lasting impact within these institutions.  We will be continuing to provide additional trainings for the rest of the year, but the longer-term plan is to: -While this is an exciting beginning, changing the ecosystem is not somethings we can or want to do on our own, so we are looking for partners to help us realize these goals in the coming years and expand the impact in the innovation ecosystem by collaborating.

Smallholder farmers that mainly cultivate cereals dominate crop production in Ethiopia.-Striga hermonthica (witchweed), known in Ethiopia as Akenchira in Amharic, is a parasitic weed that attacks cereal crops such as sorghum, millet, maize and rice in Africa and significantly reduces yields. -Striga can cause yield losses ranging from 20 to 80%, severely threatening the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Various mechanical and chemical measures, including hand weeding, crop rotation, intercropping, fertilizers, and herbicides have been developed to control Striga. However, the adoption by farmers remains limited due to reasons that include the high costs and lack of awareness. -In recent years biocontrol has gained considerable attention as a promising nature-based supplement to other control methods. Biocontrol involves using natural enemies like insects and fungal antagonists instead of chemical pesticides to control pests.  -The toothpick project has been one of the innovative products selected by the Cultiv@te project of Singapore centre for innovation and technology and the UNDP Accelerator Lab to conduct a field test in sorghum and maize growing areas of smallholding farms. This innovation is a nature-based solution, as opposed to chemical products applied to fight this weed that would have negative consequences on the environment and human health. -The Accelerator Lab had facilitated a knowledge transfer visit between the Ethiopian biotechnology institute (EBTi) and the Kenyan lab. The EBTi scientists have adopted the biological herbicide development protocol into the Ethiopian context. According to the institute, the application of this protocol is of use for a wide range of crops beyond sorghum and maize, which could be a game-changer in cereal production. -One such bio-control solution is ‘The Toothpick Project’, an initiative spearheaded by Dr David Sands of Montana State University. This involves using a highly virulent fungal pathogen viz. Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. Striga(FOXY), which is originally isolated from Striga. -The name of the project comes from the use of toothpicks on which the primary inoculum of FOXY is grown on it. The toothpick which carries FOXY is sealed into a plastic straw and gets delivered to the farmer. Consequently, the farmers prepare the secondary inoculum by placing the toothpick into cooked rice using a sterile plastic container and culturing for three days. Half a teaspoon of the secondary inoculum goes into each seed hill during planting, and the resulting product, called FoxyT14, is trademarked in Kenya as Kichawi Kill. -FoxyT14 is a cost-effective and easy to distribute and use bio-control solution for Striga. Field trials among smallholder farmers in Kenya demonstrated an increase in maize yields of 42-56%. -Through Cultiv@te, UNDP seeks to introduce FoxyT14 in Ethiopia. UNDP facilitated a research collaboration between the Toothpick Project and the Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute (EBTi) to identify Ethiopian local Foxy strains, field trials on different crops, and evaluate the efficacy of locally identified strains compared with commercially available strains. -The project hopes to radically transform Striga control and management in Ethiopia using local FOXY strains for bio-control, leading to at least a 20% increase in yields of cereal crops and consequently improved food security and livelihoods for Ethiopian smallholder farmers. -Sample collection and isolation of Fusarium -The EBTi team has collected wilted Striga weeds from two regions (Southern Nations Nationalities and People Region- Arbaminch area and Benishangul-Gumuz-Assosa area) in the 2021 cropping season. -Thirty-five samples were collected from four Kebels (smaller administration units). Fusariums were isolated from the collected Striga samples at Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute (EBTi) mycology laboratory (Fig 1). -Twenty-four Fusarium isolates were identified for further characterization.-Exposure visit -Research partnership and experience sharing among the project members of African countries is crucial for research capacity building and efficient skill transfer. In this regard, the Toothpick Project and Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KARLO) organized an exposure visit for the Ethiopia and Cameron research team at KARLO laboratory, Katuman, Kenya, in November 2021. Two researchers from EBTi participated in this exposure visit with the support of the UNDP-Ethiopia accelerator lab. -The exposure visit helped to establish a network between researchers doing the same work and also enhance the skill of the project team members. Also, it creates a platform for the researchers from three Toothpick project member countries to visualize and understand the project implementation in each respective country. It has given the team an opportunity to engage in discussions with the research teams and the toothpick project manager. -The exposure visit played a role in building research collaboration and facilitating the project implementation. Considering the need to further strengthen the research collaboration among the member countries, the participants were able to identify potential research ideas for further collaborations. -The next activity involves the Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute and UNDP accelerator lab conducting experimentation, evaluation and validation of isolated FOXY strain at the laboratory and field level.-In parallel, samples collection will continue, and Fusurim will be isolated from Striga hot spot regions (Amhara and Oromia). The selected local FOXY strain, and the appropriate methodology for the preparation of fresh on-farm inoculum technology, will be investigated. Upon the successful completion of the on-farm evaluation of the technology, it will be scaled up in the major Striga infested regions of Ethiopia. Accordingly, this technology will be trademarked and commercialized in Ethiopia. These activities are undertaken by application for additional funding and connected with government technology incubation centres.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,UNDP Donor Partners,Ethiopia,blog series,Solutions Mapping,English,foundations,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

We wanted to sense the culture and scan the trends around knowledge creation (learning and innovating), knowledge sharing (networking) and knowledge usage(collaboration) to build an organizational culture that is fit to tackle the complex development challenges we face. We did this through a series of exercises to help us:  -The exercises included a behavioural insight exercise on the current practices and the perceived value of knowledge by staff. We looked at additional data sources like the general staff survey and blog engagement data to get a broader and more accurate picture of the practice on the ground. We used scenario planning and desired futures with the team leader and portfolio manager to understand how they envision their teams working the new connected way, what needs to change about the way we work now and what needs to stay. This exercise helped us identify pathways to solutions we can test to get to a more innovative and collaborative working environment. --The current culture  -We looked at an existing staff perception survey to understand the innovation and collaboration culture in the office. -We found out that the value of innovation is understood, but there are challenges to bringing it into practice, such as being risk-averse, fear of failure, and not feeling empowered to try new ways of working. -The staff expressed that adapting to new ways of working was not easy, but we are getting better at being open to ideas, and there is also good collaboration and teamwork in general. -However, one point that resonated with us was that they felt that having access to knowledge and expertise across UNDP was not easy.  -To explore this further, we employed our exploration that specifically looked at how knowledge is created and shared within the office. -This exercise helped us learn that staff felt that learning and sharing are key for innovation and collaboration. -However, the how remains a challenge, especially for sharing knowledge. The majority of participants expressed that they would like to share, but they failed to do so because they did not know how and where to share their knowledge. -Exploring further showed a perception of a lack of dedicated space for learning where staff can explore by themselves. The lack of an easily accessible knowledge-sharing platform is the major barrier for those who would like to share regularly. -The most common medium for learning about other teams' work is currently through meetings such as monthly program meetings, showing that personal interactions are the common way for learning. Motivation for making knowledge sharing part of the work plan was recognition from peers and management.  -The desired future-Looking to the future, as an organization, we are building an open, innovative, networked, and collaborative work environment. However, what does that mean on a day-to-day basis? From our exploration of the desires of senior management, we saw that they are looking to have a motivated and passionate team that regularly interacts with each other and works together to learn new things through experimentation. -When they think about collaboration, they view it as horizontal linkage and cooperation rather than the traditional exchange of information within the hierarchy. Creating customized platforms and tools to generate evidence and best practices need to be developed for open learning. -When they think about networking, they think more of creating an incentive-based platform to share the results, information, and joint work. A network would also need shared goals and interests beyond the current team structures, which have dedicated time and resources to create multiple sharing opportunities and communication channels. -Practically, we are looking at joint learning plans, sharing weeks, recognition and accountability of teams to shared goals, and senior management dedicating time and resources for learning and sharing. The key here is not seeing learning and sharing outside of, or in addition to our current workflow, but rather about making knowledge creation and sharing an integral part of our work plans. It can’t be a nice to have it, but rather a must have. --The experiment-We now understand that while there is a common acceptance and understanding of what we need to do conceptually, there needs to be a cultural change in how we value and express knowledge. -A structured way of integrating our work and sharing is necessary on what we are learning. -This approach means we need to have scalable solutions that simultaneously bring mindset change and change the way we work. -As we are collaborating with a UNDP-SIDA (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) project and the Communication Hub within our country office to prototype and experiment with a few tools to support integrated programming. -One component of the project is strengthening knowledge management within the country office, and the Communication Hub is leading on the development of a three-year roadmap to facilitate synergies, collaboration and partnerships among CO staff and external stakeholders.-Therefore, we are working jointly to design and experiment with scalable solutions to be integrated into the roadmap and become part of the integrated action plan. -In the experimentation will be looked at if :-The experiments will be looking at the short-term outcomes of whether joint initiatives take place, such as more interaction between staff and increased participation in networking platforms. In the medium term, we will be looking for knowledge products and access to knowledge within the country office. We will be holding the experimentation in the first half of 2022 and look forward to sharing our insights.

Waste disposal is a critical issue for the environment and public health. There are several initiatives to turn this threat into wealth through responsible consumption and production framework of sustainable development.-Solid waste management is one of the key services a city requires, and this is more so with the rapid growth of Addis Ababa. Residential solid waste constitutes a sizable share of this municipal waste, and therefore we need to dispose of it properly. According to Diriba & Xiang-Zhou (2021), households contribute 76% of municipal waste. For urban waste, residential areas contribute considerably and having behavioural and practical issues addressed at the household level could make a difference in waste disposal impacts. Moreover, instead of blanket approaches across the city, pragmatic decisions based on the existing data could make the city’s administration prioritize issues to address. This approach will also economize resources through an improved use efficiency while tackling solid waste-related challenges.-Our exploration in Adama and Bishoftu (Oromia regional towns) brought us research questions that we may need further study in specific cases. In our exploration, we have understood that the demographic status of residents could make a difference in solid waste management practices at the household level. Municipality experts reported the comparably low economic class residents solid waste segregation practices over the other segments of the community. Such economic class-based differences in waste management practices within the same town caught our attention to do an in-depth study in the capital city on geographically contrasted locations. Contrasting locations are also proxy indicators of economic classes through residential differentiations. Surveyed locations are indicated in the following map (Figure 1).-In addition, we also tested the hypothesis to see if solid waste volume and physical distances from transfer stations could affect households decision to dispose of their waste improperly. Therefore, we have assumed that households that reside the farthest from the transfer station and generate a higher volume of waste would likely dispose of their waste improperly. Improper waste disposal practices (such as on streets, open fields, and open canals) were linked to the households that participated in the survey.-Using the existing distances between households from transfer stations and the waste amount produced by the household, a simple logistic regression method was applied to run the test. The model was used to analyze if the aforementioned factors determine a household’s behaviour on how waste is disposed of and to predict the probability of a household’s tendency to dispose of waste improperly. This information could give insight to the local waste administration unit to either reorient the transfer stations distributions; or set priorities to tackle important factors affecting households’ behaviour. Therefore, improper waste disposal is captured as a binary category with a maximum likelihood of one.-Where P is the likelihood of improper waste disposal behaviour, x is the independent variable explaining the occurrence of improper waste disposal, α is an intercept, and β is a coefficient for independent variables. Then the Analysis of maximum likelihood estimates could lead us to what factor could be determinant for improper waste disposal for households. Analysis of results returned coefficients of intercept =-3.8961024, Distance from transfer station=0.0007044, and Waste size=0.1834206 and their significances < 2e-16 ***, 0.711, and 3.59e-14 *** respectively. Results depict that it was only the size of the waste, which could be said statistically important factor, but not the household’s distance from a transfer station. Therefore, the occurrence of expected behaviour (improper waste disposal) could be explained as : -From this simple analysis, we have learned that a household’s distance from its nearby transfer station does not determine the household's behaviour when it comes to the proper disposal of waste. The size of the generated waste could also affect a household’s decision on whether to dispose of it in the assigned transfer stations or to practice improper disposal. Therefore, we have concluded that our alternate hypothesis on the improper disposal of solid waste is partially accepted, as solid waste size determines improper solid waste disposal. Based on these findings, the local solid waste administration could focus on areas that generate a larger quantity of waste per household per week and develop a set of interventions that enhances proper waste disposal. Beyond this piece of insight, an emulation of similar experiences on data-driven decisions could be applied to analyze multiple suspected factors that are affecting certain situations in a development context, similar to waste disposal behaviour. This approach could help local authorities and development organizations be pragmatic and manage for impacts, instead of having blanket interventions that sometimes result in wasted time, financial resources and low results.","['Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Africa,Innovation,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,partnerships,Ethiopia,blog series,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,foundations,Goal 13  Climate action,Data Innovation,English,Accelerator Labs"

She founded her pioneer digital platform LSSAY that gives access to affordable and convenient virtual connections to the mental health profession in Ethiopia. She has successfully piloted her idea through social platforms for a year and is now looking to launch a website and expand her reach in the untapped market.-Lidiya is one of the young people starting their entrepreneurship journeys all over the country, shaping their futures and changing society. So, where do they turn to get support navigating the road from idea to a business, and how might we, at UNDP, help create an ecosystem today that can help build an equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for all.  -Building an economy that is open to doing business, inclusive to all and have stable employment needs an entrepreneurship ecosystem that can innovate and meet the changing demands of the market through technology and beyond. UNDP's innovation-for-development project, through the generous donation of Korea International Cooperation Agency KOICA, is strengthening the capacity of the startups and SMEs, creating better institutional coordination between ecosystem actors and facilitating access to finance. Specifically, we are working with start-ups and SMEs in ICT to be more productive and contribute to employment by providing tailored mentorship and training, global experience sharing opportunities and creating knowledge hubs for information regarding innovation and research regulation, training, and funding.--Simplified innovation ecosystem-#ETdeeds 2021-To identify startups with growth potential within the ICT sector, we launched the #ETdeeds competition. In the first-round, 138 applications were received through the online application portal from all over the country. After three rounds of screening, evaluation by a technical committee and pitching sessions, ten startups and SMEs were identified as the first cohort finalist. The finalists have received tailored mentorship and participated in an incubation program,  and accessed finance through a credit guarantee scheme upon completion of the program and investment readiness. In addition, the project is also holding a 15 boot camp where 200 entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to develop and prototype their ideas, participate in pitching sessions and come out with business plans and seed funding.-Working closely with entrepreneurs and the ecosystem actors such as universities and training institutions, we have seen some patterns on what startups want more knowledge about and get information on. Here are some areas that we have seen as being of interest to them when it comes to capacity development.  -Building partnerships-The road to innovating and entrepreneurship needs support through collaboration and partnership. We see this at the ecosystem level between different actors such as government, academia, and the private sector, but it is also true in building a start-up. We often hear people ask how to connect with others on ideas and build valuable partnerships. There is also fear of others adopting or 'stealing' new and innovative ideas, meaning that entrepreneurs are reserved about reaching to others for collaborations. There is also a question on trademarking, copyright and intellectual property that could offer legal protection. Overall, legal consulting services could benefit from more business development training. Information can also be accessible through the Intellectual property office website and our innovation and entrepreneurship platform.  --Entreprenurs visit to ICT park- -Capitalize on failure -There is a lot of trial and error in an entrepreneur’s journey, with the threat of failure and uncertainty can be a constant one. The fear of failure can also determine how entrepreneurs set their goals and take action both in either a positive or negative way. The key is seeing failure as a learning opportunity and seeing learning as a way to mitigate failure to some extent. Therefore, it is important to create networks that address success and normalize failure through mentorship and support. We have seen the appetite from entrepreneurs to learn more about what others have learned from their practical mistakes. The UNDP accelerator lab explored how we can cultivate a mentality of failure as a driver for motivation rather than something to avoid at all costs. In collaboration with the lab, we want to hold networking events centred on exploring failure opportunities to address some of these needs.- -Valuation and pitching of ideas -Once an entrepreneur has an idea validated, it should be effectively communicated to attract investment. That means entrepreneurs need ample practice in verbal and written communication of ideas. Specifically, when it comes to investment readiness, they also need to evaluate their ideas as an asset and request fair and acceptable terms from investment partners. So, while we are providing opportunities, such as innovation competitions, we also need to create formal and informal opportunities of practice for entrepreneurs to enhance their communication skills. One-time incubation or training may not be sufficient in such cases. Therefore, entrepreneurs are asking for more opportunities to practice pitching for example, before they participate in a competition. One approach we are exploring is designing boot camps that lead to competitions, rather than only doing open calls that lead to incubation opportunities. By having training opportunities beforehand, we can explore if we can better evaluate well-articulated ideas.--#ETdeeds networking event -What is Next-The innovation for development will be working on strengthening the innovation ecosystem for the next four years for a sustainable impact on the capacity of ecosystem actors, providing support to start-ups and better coordination and collaboration across the actors. We are expanding our reach to universities and centres to create market-driven innovation for industry and creating national frameworks for supporting innovation and entrepreneurship. As we move forward on this journey, we look forward to sharing key learnings and insights about the ecosystem and what it takes to make it inclusive.  - ","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Innovation,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,partnerships,UNDP Donor Partners,Agenda 2030,Ethiopia,blog series,Entrepreneurship,foundations,Data and statistics for development,Youth,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

This follows a recent re-configuration and tasking on policy and programmatic work of the Country Office, supported by the Sida-UNDP Programme on Environment and Climate Change (Sida-UNDP Programme).-The portfolio approach to programming introduces new ways of working that break down silos, emphasizing partnerships and coordination across programme units, with the goal of creating an open, innovative, collaborative, and networked team, and along with it, a strong focus on knowledge management. It advocates for more integrated work, breaking the barriers that impede delivery, creating better and more impactful results on the ground.-“Our new way of working includes learning from the past where our portfolio became fragmented, with insufficient connection among related interventions,” says Cleophas Torori, Deputy Resident Representative for Programme at the UNDP Ethiopia Country Office. Torori adds that “our future work calls for a clearer focus and logic as well as a higher level of ambition commensurate with the scale of changes happening in Ethiopia”.-In this new agile work approach, programme units will promote the environmental and climate dimensions of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework as they deliver on the UNDP Country Programme Document (2020-2025). Information sharing and learning will improve work processes by connecting the dots across the work of different teams of the Country Office. -Martha Mogus who heads the Development Communication and Advocacy Hub at the UNDP Ethiopia Country Office, and she explains: “It has been ten years since last time we had dedicated staff working on Knowledge Management in the Country Office. Through the support of the Sida-UNDP Programme we are re-engaging with this discipline and building a strategy that will support staff to systematically capture and share knowledge using a broad range of existing and new platforms”.-Parallel with these efforts, the Country Office is tapping into the work of its Accelerator Lab to connect the dots and capture lessons from programme engagement. “We are promoting a strategic and coherent approach to programming through stronger coordination ranging from work planning meetings to activity review sessions”, says Amanuel Tadesse, Head of Solutions Mapping in UNDP Ethiopia’s Accelerator Lab. “Evaluations are carried out to document learnings, improve performance and create opportunities for innovation,” he adds.-Although UNDP Ethiopia is taking great strides in facilitating integrated programming, several challenges remain, Martha Mogus notes. She emphasizes that documenting and communicating information require the development of a work culture that supports continuous sharing and learning.-Amanuel Tadesse shares these sentiments, adding that “Existing Knowledge Management tools, including digital platforms, require a systematic and uniform application by all Country Office staff.” He stresses the importance of capturing, documenting, and sharing of programmatic information through knowledge repositories and platforms as a means to increase the active participation of staff in knowledge sharing for development results.-As a first and critical step in implementing the Knowledge Management dimensions of the Sida-UNDP Programme, the Country Office has engaged a specialized consultant to identify existing knowledge assets and gaps while designing a Knowledge Management Action Plan along with a roadmap and the identification of tools needed to accelerate implementation. This Action Plan will align with and inform UNDP’s global Nature, Climate and Energy Knowledge Management Strategy under current development. “UNDP Ethiopia acknowledges and thanks the Government of Sweden for supporting these initiatives”, Cleophas Torori concludes.- ","['Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 15  Life on land,Donors,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,partnerships,UNDP Donor Partners,Development planning and monitoring,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Ethiopia,Partnerships,blog series,Environment,Goal 13  Climate action,Sweden,Knowledge management,Gender equality,Sustainable development,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

However, to make a significant impact and reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills, we need to mobilize the private sector. We also need to build a compelling case and demonstrate return on investment. Why do solid waste recycling, reuse and upcycling make good, clean (and green) business sense? The market for segregated waste and waste products is currently be limited to recycling plastic and composting organic waste. However, there is a real opportunity as well as encouraging signs that turning waste into usable items (upcycling) and recycling paper, rubber, metal, among others, has the potential to grow in Ethiopia. -Buoyed by this prospect the Accelerator Lab sought to explore and experiment this further by reaching out and connecting with key stakeholders and budding innovators interested in recycling, reusing, and upcycling. To operationalize this, the Lab Team embarked on a Solution ‘Safari’ to map out different waste products that can be profitable for waste collectors and held a solution fest to introduce waste and sustainable products. This expedition enabled us to listen to various inspiring stories of young people building their creative businesses while being environmentally conscious.-The Solution Fest-As a next step, the Accelerator Lab collaborated with the Addis Ababa Solid Waste Management Agency to organize a two-day solution fest that attracted over five hundred visitors. The fest enhanced local engagement within the ecosystem, providing an opportunity to explore the possibilities for stimulating the existing waste market and creating connections across the value chain for a robust and environmentally sustainable waste management system. The fest exhibited start-ups and innovators working with waste products, matched waste collectors, municipalities, and private sectors within the value chain, and held a dialogue to enhance community engagement within the ecosystem.-The event created a unique opportunity and space for the exhibitors to showcase their innovations, explore connections with potential partners and initiate business transaction discussions with potential clients. In addition, it provided an opportunity for wider networking among the ecosystem players, as was reflected during the storytelling session provided for during the event. - -Scaling Deep-During the event, we engaged in a futuristic and solution-driven discussion about waste management, including looking at how we can improve the market for recycling, upcycling, and reducing waste. In two panel discussions, we looked at how we can move towards sustainable waste management from the environmental, public health, and job creation perspectives. These dialogues were the highlight of the event, helping participants to generate ideas and lessons. The exchanges focused on building a waste management ecosystem that is open to economic opportunities, has positive impacts on cultural practices and influences policies and programmes. -Theme one - The Future of Waste Management: Strategies for Economic Opportunity and Environmental sustainability.  The session raised several learning questions like, what is the approach for a waste management system that is environmentally sustainable that is open to economic opportunities? How is the Public-Private Partnership working in waste management? What does research reveal about trends in waste management? How do we coordinate our efforts and create synergies for the future? -Representatives from the government, a private recycling company, UNDP’s NAMA compost project and Waste to Energy researchers reflected on these points. -Theme two - What opportunities exist? Their role in building a circular economy on waste.-The second dialogue brought together multi-national corporations, environmental social movements, and urban design innovation hubs to share their experience and practical approach on the theme.- -Their story focused on developing a shared responsibility and approach to waste management, the key issues and challenges. Other questions included how to open waste as a business/ job opportunity, identifying opportunities for creating a circular economy, and creating connections across the waste value chain? How does advocacy contribute to a shared responsibility for waste management?-Interesting reflections shared during this discussion included tackling the challenge caused by the absence of a proper system design from waste collection centre to waste disposal. The discussants emphasized the need for end-to-end design thinking in the waste system.  -At the end of the discussions, we captured important learnings on how people can get into upscaling or recycling business, making it profitable, green and sustainable. These are captured below:  -“We need to move from passion and stories for recycling to proper design thinking and system,” said Mahder who is a founder of the Urban centre. -If you are interested in this topic and have any ideas or suggestions, we would love to hear from you through email address.  ethiopia.acclab@undp.org.- ","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Design Thinking,Ethiopia,blog series,Solutions Mapping,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,foundations,Goal 13  Climate action,English,Accelerator Labs"

The initiative focused on creating an integrated and whole-of-government approach to minimizing the disruption of critical government services, through among other actions, installation of incident management systems, disaster response and recovery capabilities, and generally the adoption of new business continuity practices through training. The success of this intervention planted a seed for digitalization that has the prospect of replication and scaling up. -As a background, the socio-economic impact assessment conducted by the United Nations in Ethiopia following the outbreak showed us that scaling up digital transformation in the public and private sectors would support the development of a strong digital ecosystem for business continuity and sustainability in Ethiopia. -The digital economy in Ethiopia is nascent with few government-driven digitalization initiatives and the urgent need for coordination and collaboration among different sectors, institutions, and stakeholders to strengthen and enable an inclusive digital economy. The government's digital strategy points to improved digital interactions among the government, private sector, and citizens. -So, we set out to test a model for a public-private partnership for government technologies within the context of the pandemic that enforces the need and urgency for digital technologies. We wanted to see how we can create opportunities for small start-ups that can't participate in large scale national-level technology procurements; yet can provide tailored need-based technologies that are not meet by tools deployed nationally. -What we did-UNDP Ethiopia's accelerator lab partnered with the Ministry of Innovation and Technology to enlist local innovators in a pilot initiative intended to digitize critical government functions linked to business continuity. The innovation challenge identified and is testing innovative solutions that can allow government institutions to continue providing critical services to the public. Moreover, the challenge grant connected the public and private sector in a co-design effort. This linkage was a win-win partnership, assisting government institutions to provide services efficiently while supporting private technology sector growth. -Challenge creation -It was critical to define the challenge closely with the government institutions, so we conducted a multi-phased problem definition process that included: -Once the challenge areas were identified, we created an online application portal and advertised the challenge grant on different platforms inviting bids from prospective digital entrepreneurs. We received 174 applications across the eight challenge areas identified, from which 134 of them passed the first-round screening, which looked at the eligibility of the applicants and whether they met the basic requirements. -Subsequently, an evaluation committee comprising representatives from UNDP, INSA, TECH-IN, MINT and Ethiopian Innovator Association conducted two rounds of evaluations. The evaluation included reviewing documentation, presentation, and budget to identify a solution for the challenges outlined by the different institutions. Finally, seven potential innovations were selected and enrolled into a business incubation program led by X-Hub Addis to refine their products and create a business model that would allow them to experiment. -The selected solutions will now be refined and tested with the institutions through grant funding and business development support during the process. The clients' involvement in the development phase will increase the relevancy of the solution, but it also requires a commitment to the process from both sides. Once the solutions are tested, it is up to the institution and the start-up to implement. The grant process will connect the start-ups with the institutions, but it will also support the testing. --What we learned-From this model of public-private partnership, we learned a number of things that are worth mentioning here:-Digital Infrastructure: Currently, Ethiopia suffers from poor connectivity, which is not necessarily an issue of resources, just one of prioritization. Ultimately, in the medium to long term, UNDP will use this intervention to advocate for policy reform to allow for increased connectivity across the country. In the meantime, establishment of alternate working arrangements and workflows, use of innovative solutions including ICT will create the appetite for the adoption of e-governance and e-service provision for key functions, encouraging online rather than in-person contact.-What is Next -The transformation to digital solutions is critical to support business continuity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. However, improving access to essential services to all citizens and accelerating the digitalization of services must be done carefully to avoid widening the ‘digital divide’ between economic sectors and those with differing abilities.-The support for product and business development support for the innovators includes training on how to build their capacity to continuously innovate on their solutions and approaches beyond selling their products. -Moreover, our incubation partner X-Hub will help the innovators refine their business model to be accessible to government clients and the community. The accelerator lab is also exploring partnerships with our Democratic Governance and Peacebuilding Unit of UNDP with a view to jointly growing the solutions once they prove to be working. -If you are interested in this topic and have any ideas or suggestion, we would love to hear from you throughout email address.  ethiopia.acclab@undp.org- ","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08']","blog series,Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Solutions Mapping,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,English,Accelerator Labs,Ethiopia"

The accelerator labs are part of a new way of working for UNDP and bring innovation into how we identify, understand, and solve challenges. In turn, we can be innovative in applying collective intelligence, unusual data sourcing and portfolio thinking into project design, implementation, and monitoring.  -UNDP Ethiopia recognises the need for finding new ways of approaching the dynamic challenges facing the country. It also acknowledges the responsibility we all carry in helping the country achieve sustainable development. In doing so, we would be creating open, innovative, networked, and collaborative programmes anchored on a portfolio approach to inclusive economic growth, climate resilience and democratic governance. -Nevertheless, what we have learnt is that changing the way we work is easier said than done. We would need to see a culture change and a shift in mindsets. This change would actively promote a culture that builds on a shared vision for our work and for the results we seek to achieve together. As we are setting out to achieve this new way of working, the accelerator lab wants to bring its expertise and experience to build a learning organisation that is more innovative, networked and forward-looking. -So, we are designing a self-exploratory plan on how we create, exchange, and use knowledge internally as a basis for identifying solutions that can help bring more collaboration and innovation. Here is what we are setting out to learn.  --What is it, and what is it not?-Innovation and collaboration have become buzzwords that mean a range of different things depending on who talks to you. We often talk about it but do not usually follow up with action, maybe because we might not always know what it looks like in action. It is common in Ethiopia to think of innovation only for tech solutions, yet technology is a means and not the end. Therefore, we want to clearly define what these concepts of open, innovative, networked, and collaboration mean for us, what they are not, and what they should look like in action.-We plan to hold a series of exercises with team leaders, portfolio managers and senior management, where we will use scenario planning, desired futures, and backstabbing. We want to know how they envision their teams working this new way, what needs to change about the way we work now and what needs to stay. This exercise will help us identify pathways to reach a more innovative and collaborative working environment.--Scanning the trend-The creation, exchange, and usage of knowledge play a crucial role in innovation. The knowledge-sharing culture in an organization, the way an organization creates space for the free exchange of knowledge and experience, drives how the organization collaborates and opens a space for innovation. Therefore, we want to explore the intersection between our organizational culture and internal knowledge sharing. Knowledge includes how it is shared, and who it shares it, and how this practice works for or against the new working environment we are building.-To do this, we will engage the staff in a behavioural insight exercise on how they create, share, and use knowledge while at the same time extracting the perception of the value of knowledge. We will also be looking at additional data sources like the general staff survey and experience in knowledge sharing to get the border picture of the practice.-What is next?-Based on the actionable insights generated through these activities, we will work with targeted teams to experiment with solutions and how to create more spaces for learning from each other, collaborate and innovate together. We want to take these insights to create and share knowledge on how we can develop innovative and collaborative working environments.-We will be sharing our findings and what we learned in the next blog, but we would love to hear your comments and suggestion, so feel free to reach out on social media or at ethiopia.acclab@undp.org- ",['Icon of SDG 17'],"blog series,Innovation,Blog post,Sensemaking,Collective Intelligence,English,Accelerator Labs,Ethiopia,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

This was exacerbated by the widespread conspiracy theories and misinformation about the pandemic especially in its early days, how it was spread and measures one needed to take protect oneself against infection.  -As part of the COVID-19 response plan, the lab team partnered with the Industrial Park Development Corporation and VIAMO, a mobile tech company which excels in providing solutions in areas where technology infrastructure is poor, to develop an awareness creation campaign to empower employees to keep themselves safe and create positive work environment.  VIAMO’s platform allowed us to reach close to 20,000 workers across the country who speak multiple languages and have varying literacy levels.-Viamo proved that using a ubiquitous infrastructure like a mobile phone can make data collection simpler for hard-to-reach places.-Before setting out on the camping, we needed to understand what information the workers were interested in having. Given the entrance restrictions to the parks due to the pandemic and the strict working hours, we could not get this information through the traditional means. Instead, we collected this data through mass phone calls with automated messaging. We got the necessary insight to design the type of communication campaign that would be of interest to the workers and addressed the information that they were not getting through other outlets.-From a sample of 3,000 employees, we learned that respondents (48%) were interested in knowing more about the causes of COVID-19. 79% of respondents felt it was a personal responsibility to protect themselves from COVID-19. In addition, 35% of respondents said they would stay at home and self-medicate if they or a member of their household got infected with COVID-19 which prompted us to think about effective home care procedures. This supported the majority of responder’s (64%) understanding that COVID-19 symptoms without underlying conditions can be treated safely at home.-          -- ----With this information, we were able to see that worker’s knowledge about the COVID 19 causes and preventive methods were good so we directed our content to be more focused on messages addressing community behavior change, information about healthcare services, and accurate updates on the outbreak to the community while correcting false information and rumors.-We developed a customized and targeted SMS and IVR message campaign and behavior change messaging that reached 18,579 workers. We pushed information directly to employees’ phones, but also provided and info line where they could access the information on their own time. The latter approached proved to be more effective as employees could access the information as they need rather than getting phone calls at time that might be inconvenient for them. Giving the workers option to learn at their own convenience increased the uptake. - -- ---Following this activity, we conducted an end-line survey with the same targeted industrial workers. The beneficiaries were able to enhance their understanding of when and how they are at risk of being infected. 72% of respondents felt that it was their responsibility to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection; 37% of respondents said they would stay at home and self-medicate if they or a household member had COVID-19(an increase of 2% from baseline); 36% of respondents thought that resting is one of the treatments for mild COVID-19 symptoms (an increase of 4% from baseline) and; 66% of respondents thought that COVID-19 symptoms without underlying conditions can be treated safely at home (an increase of 4%). -Creating awareness in the work environment complemented with targeted information for management.-From our initial assessment, we were able to discern that the work environment itself was a source of stress for workers as they perceived a lack of communication from management on precautions and felt in the dark about the future of their jobs. -To address this, we targeted six industrial parks and provided remote training for 230 supervisors. We used mobile phone-based IVR (interactive voice response) technology and SMS in four local languages. The training included crisis communication tools that effectively deal with misinformation and communicate risks to employees. -The quiz results from the lessons had a correct rate of at least 70% (8 out of 12 modules) showing that most of the trainees understood what they learned. This controls the pandemic and creates a positive and productive working environment. -Though we could see that trainees have acquired new knowledge, the remote nature of this exercise limited our ability to assess the exact impact of the intervention, especially to see if supervisors had started to practice what they had learned. -Throughout this process, we were able to disprove prior assumptions that we had that it was impossible to reach industrial park workers due to locked down and the country's low technology experience.-Using these technologies made it easier for us to collect, store, analyze, use, and disseminate data. It enabled us to collect information without putting anyone in danger. And because we were using both voice and SMS, we made information accessible to workers with diverse literacy levels. Making sense of the vast amounts of data collected within the industrial park and visualizing it helped to support IPDC revisit its business continuity plans and take some corrective measure.The ongoing pandemic has taught us that partnership is key for accelerating solutions. This initiative showcased how we delivered and impacted our beneficiaries through collaboration, community engagement and an unusual way of doing things. We proved that behavioral change communication campaign can be enhanced by use of digital technologies like Voice based Information service, targeted mass messaging campaigns, mobile surveys, social media chatbot campaign, gamification and data visualizations. The success of this initiative is exciting. The platform that we used reached the masses with the right information.-We would be happy to hear your thoughts on this topic on our social media (Twitter @UNDPEthiopia or Facebook UNDPinEthiopia) or through email at ethiopia.acclab@undp.org.- ","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Ethnography,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,partnerships,Ethiopia,blog series,Behavioral Insights,Data Innovation,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

According to Gambia Association of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons (GADHOH), approximately 39,000 (about 2%) of the population are deaf. UNDP has been working with such partners to promote inclusivity and ensures that no one is left behind, as the SDG relies on the involvement and inclusion of persons with disability to be fully realized., UNDP through its Accelerator lab partnered with the Association of Sign Language Interpretation (ASLI) of the Gambia to design an experiment as part of its portfolio on disability inclusion.   The experiment consists in promoting inclusivity in governance within that community through sign language interpretation of the nightly news using a signal box.-This experiment came at a time when the country was embarking on the first post transition presidential election. The 2021 election year was a real test for The Gambia’s democratic system, and its peace and security structures. Among the registered voters, Total number of registered voters ahead of the December 2021 election was 962,157 (2021), including 545,318 women (56.68%) and 416,839 men (43.32%). The percentage registered youths (18-35 years) voters stand at 57.71% (555,220)- As a result, the election dominated the media establishments on both air and print media, but also on social media. The 8pm news hour is a source of news for the majority of Gambians.-Through consultations with various actors and in the AccLab’s engagement with partners and disrupters at the grassroots level, it was realized that although hard of hearing persons were among those that would assemble around their TV set for the nightly news broadcast, many found it challenging to understand what was being reported. The AccLab explored the possibility of partnering with ASLI to interpret nightly news for the hard of hearing persons five months prior to election date.-Another partnership was key in realizing this initiative. The largest private TV station swiftly embraced the idea and took ownership of the project by agreeing to embedding an interpretation signal box without a cost as part of their corporate social responsibility. After the first month, the GADHOH and UNDP received overwhelming feedback from the hard of hearing community praising the initiative. The programme also captures the attention of the Gambian community, as for the first time seeing the signal box along with news presenter during the hour. This furthers many people’s curiosity and boost their eagerness to realize that this has been a missed opportunity for most of our loved ones in the hard of hearing community. The hard of hearing community also took to the social media endorsing the programme and express their gratitude, and felt they are now included in the news stories of the country. The feedback was extended to colleagues within the UN System in The Gambia and sparked a deep reflection on the way we were ensuring inclusivity in our programs and ensuring that no one was left behind.-With UNDP receiving encouraging feedback from all over the country, from diverse communities, a decision was made to further engage with the hard of hearing persons themselves. A sensemaking and feedback forum was organized to get a sense how this programme was received and the impact it was having in the stakeholder communities. A significant amount of insider knowledge was built during the interactive sense making exercise, a with very valuable suggestions about how they would like to engage moving forward. For instance, a point was made to the AccLab team to ensure that the interpretation was continued throughout the inauguration period and next phases of the electoral process.  -This initiative ensures that people with this disability, particularly women, are also aware of the evolving issues and ensures their participation in the political discourse which was our primary objective. In the past months, the sign language interpretation has for the first time in The Gambia, captured the attention of many including the office of the President, many government institutions and other UN sister agencies. It is a positive step in ensuring that all people despite their disability could be included in the developmental process and contribute to the efforts for the achievement of the SDGs. One of the key unexpected outcomes of the experiment was the ability of the experiment to achieve a positive deviance within the community in contributing to covid-19 vaccine sensitization.-Secondly, it was later revealed that some members of the HoH community expressed interested to contest in the upcoming National Assembly and local elections.  Futhermore, the AccLab was able to enact the handover mandate of the overall Accelerator Lab model by handing over the results of the experiment to UNDP Governance Unit to ensure continuity of the service throughout the electoral cycle.-As the UNDP continues to explore areas of intervention within the disability portfolio, this AccLab intervention has been a recognized success and will certainly open up new inclusive component.

Sensitive to the “new normal” imposed by COVID-19, the UNDP The Gambia Accelerator Lab, together with the government, through the COVID 19 Recovery Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, explored how to support the Directorate of Development Planning and make the formulation processes more inclusive for all factions of the society including non-literates and people with disabilities.-How it all started? When COVID-19 emerged in The Gambia, the issue of how to balance government service continuity on the one hand with adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures on the other, came to the fore of development practice. This assumed additional significance given that 2021 was a significant period in the Gambia’s development planning landscape as two critical planning documents were up for formulation. These were (i) a Recovery Focused National Development Plan to succeed the National Development Plan (2018 – 2021) and (ii) the Long-Term Development Vision 2050 to succeed the expired Vision 2020 blueprint.-Ordinarily and in keeping with The Gambia’s commitment to leave no one behind, the formulation process of these two national documents would involve the usual face to face consultations/dialogue aimed at gauging stakeholder perspectives. However, this was no longer possible in view of the physical distancing demanded by COVID-19 preventive protocols. Notwithstanding, it was imperative that multilevel and multiparty stakeholder consultations take place as anything less would have had significant negative implications for peacebuilding and social cohesion, community ownership, social inclusion, and overall sustainable development.-Digitalizing Civic Engagement. Innovation is often not thought of as originating from the public sector, which in an ideal context is responsible for creating the enabling environment wherein such innovation occurs. Nonetheless, public sector innovation is a necessity, not only because of a need to improve processes within the public sector for greater public service delivery, but also because its interrelation with the other sections of the economy requires some level of compatibility. The general interest with digitalization, efficiency, and speed, means that the only way for the public sector to respond is in kind, translating in corresponding and easy to use platforms.-To overcome the challenge of participatory formulation of development plans in a COVID-19 era, the potentials of ICT – particularly, virtual consultations mechanisms was harnessed, in a format that could well be the future of stakeholder consultations. This use of virtual platforms for community consultations will allow citizens, in their own time and in their own place, adapt to the new normal imposed by COVID-19, make their contributions and get involved with the planning and formulation process of the COVID-19 Recovery and the long-term Vision. Furthermore, the platform was envisaged to provide a comprehensive apparatus for consultations between Government and the diaspora who continue to evolve as a significant partner in development as exemplified by the recent doubling and now 30 per cent increase of contribution of remittances to the nation’s GDP.-Partnership for Results: In a perfect union between development managers and IT specialists, the platform was established over the course of 3 phases:--          Sensemaking Sessions--          Outreach and Communications component--          3-day Hackathon to create web-platform- -Sensemaking Sessions: The concept of the ndpp.gm platform was firmed up through a series of brainstorming sessions undertaken by actors drawn from the public sector, media, private sector, civil society, civic educators, UN, statistics and data institution, women representatives, and so forth. This multidisciplinary approach ensured no one was left behind and the platform catered for various end users. For effectiveness, the group was categorized into two, namely the technical team and the content development and communications team. The technical team laid the foundation for the frontend and backend development as well as management and maintenance of the platform. By the same token the content and communications team mobilized the information that would feed into the platform while also leading on a communications strategy for popularizing the use of the platform.-A critical feature that also emerged during this phase is the use of Use A.I. detection tools for keyword searches with Machine Learning, Chatbot, and data collection systems in place to capture views expressed by users of the IVR, voice calls and SMS short code facilities what formed part of the platform. This last group of facilities catered for users without access to or ability to use internet-based facilities.-Outreach and Communications Component: Key elements worked on during this phase are,  multi-stakeholder engagement workplan to ensure continuous participation of all stakeholders throughout the virtual consultation process, information materials to be featured in the platform, methods and materials targeting various media outlets for public sensitization, outreach activities at national and local levels to sensitize citizens on the COVID-19 Recovery and Long-Term Development Vision 2050, as well as mechanisms to ensure outreach and the engagement of marginalized and vulnerable groups; women, youths, children, and persons with disabilities.-3-day Hackathon to create web-platform: This brought together the software developers from various government institutions known as the Gambia Application Development Team (GADT) along with AccLabGM and the content providers to create the platform, conduct a test run and further brainstorm on how to popularize the webpage. During this period, they created content related to among others things; user guidelines, policy briefs, opinion polls and surveys, upcoming events and webinars, knowledge hub, E-participation hub and experts group link.-Conclusion & Call to action. The ndpp.gm platform is a significant tool in The Gambia’s development planning scene and has added significant value to its processes. With a huge potential for up scaling and add-ons, this initiative will also build capacity within government and retain knowledge and skills for the progress of the platform for other uses. Ndpp.gm also avails users a one-stop facility on development planning and brings together its demand and supply elements in not only a static format but also an interactive format. Contributing knowledge, technical assistance and financial support, the critical role played by the Gambia’s UNDP Accelerator Lab and COVID-19 Recovery secretariat has once again, reaffirmed the value of UNDP’s integrator role and its championing of public sector innovations in The Gambia. Although not without challenges, such as high data costs, energy reliability, and digital literacy, the creation of the platform is a leap in the right direction to ensure vibrancy in the civic engagement space using a digital public good.-The nddp.gm platform is thus a great start, and indeed a significant milestone for the Directorate of Development Planning at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs. Yet it is certainly not the final destination as it signals a huge reservoir of untapped potentials that the public, private and international development institutions can tap into in tandem for sustainable progress, peace and prosperity in The Gambia.-Visit www.nddp.gm to have your say.- - ",['Icon of SDG 09'],"Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Gambia,Blog post,English"

Therefore, investing in the education and skills development of the youthful Gambian population willstimulate socioeconomic activities and generate an active, enlightened citizenry that can significantly inform and shape policy decisions. Given this centrality in development, the UNDP Gambia Accelerator Lab (hereinafter AcclabGM or the Lab), designed a comprehensive Education and Development portfolio that seeks to explore and adequately tap this development potential. In this drive, locally sourced education solutions have been mapped out ranging from digital learning technologies and community-based mediums, working with local and unconventional development partners.-Design and dissemination of E-learning Solutions-In the context of the COVID-19  pandemic , the Lab kicked-off a partnership with Gisqo, a local software development and digital marketing company, to design an e-learning platform to support students cope with the educational challenges posed by the pandemic. This partnership, supported by The Gambia’s Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE) culminated in the development of G-Quiz – a mobile friendly application that enables high school students, particularly those preparing for the WASSCE (West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examination) to get access to wide-range of educational resources.The G-Quiz app contains past WASSCE questions developed in a user-friendly manner for students to revise as they prepare for this sub-regional exam. -The primary beneficiaries for this e-learning solution are provincial schools, given their disadvantaged position in terms of accessing educational infrastructures and services. This was particularly exposed by the pandemic. Notwithstanding, research has recurrently showed considerable academic underperformance among provincial students compared to their urban counterparts in the WAEC exams.Bridging this educational gap is pivotal towards building an inclusive and sustainable development. In cognizance of this, AcclabGM, GISQO, and the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE) embarked on a nation-wide tour to introduce the resulting innovation, a mobile application called G-Quiz.  Part of the tour activity included supporting students to install the app and distribute access codes to schools across both rural and urban Gambia. A total of 78 schools were visited, representing 88% of the national coverage.-The ‘Library on Wheels’ project-More recently, the lab is leading and stimulating stakeholder intervention in the area of community education through solutions mapping field visits and engaging sister UN agencies such as UNICEF and UNESCO. This initiative is underpinned by the rationale that the establishment of community learning projects can perform the multi-purpose functions of providing educational materials, training and mentorship opportunities for deprived local communities. The Lab’s bourgeoning interest in community-based education is also inspired by the Gambia Community Library Project situated in Kafuta Village, in the West Coast Region. Through a field visit, it was uncovered that since the project’s inception in 2016, the community library benefitted over 10,000 students, predominantly in rural parts of the Gambia.  It has, among other things, donated books to schools in several regions in the Gambia, including the Lower Region. The project also organizes extra extracurricular activities such as reading circles, lending books to children in a bid to improve reading skills at the local community level.-To replicate and pilot this initiative, the Lab has designed a ‘Library on Wheels’ project that seeks to provides access to books, learning and mentorship. The mobile library will help reach the remotest communities across the country—directly serve needy children— in efforts to improve their academic performance and bridge the rural-urban educational gap. This project will also integrate an e-learning component that provides rural students access to digital technologies and improved educational materials, and as well bridge the digital divide.-UNDP-UTG SDG Challenge and Lecture Series-Additionally, given AcclabGM’s role in foreseeing the on-going partnership between the UNDP and the University of The Gambia (UTG), it facilitated the inaugural SDG Lecture Series, where Prof. Joon Oh of the Korea Development Institute (KDI) presented on ‘The SDGs and National Development’.  This program forms an integral part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2020 between UNDP and UTG in partnering on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in The Gambia. Since the establishment of this agreement, the Lab has been coordinating with the country’s main university to implement its maiden SDG Challenge.-The SDG Challenge, led by the UTG Students’ Union, is geared towards encouraging SDG centered student-led research and innovation-driven project with alignment to the Gambia’s national development plans. As part of this process, the students have initiated a three-day SDG Bootcamp to widen sudents’ understandings of the different thematic areas within the SDGs under the guidance of trained mentors. The camp contributed to enhancing planning, presenting, leadership, listening, and teamwork skills among UTG’s student body.-In conclusion, despite remarkable progress in providing access and inclusive education in The Gambia, considerable challenges such as lack of adequate learning spaces, materials, accessibility to trained teachers and mentorship  remain unaddressed, particularly in rural areas. Notably, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated some of the longstanding educational challenges in the country. While trying to recover from the shocks of the pandemic, it is imperative that concerted efforts are channeled towards empowering schools and building e-learning capabilities are promoted and better supported in enhancing access and inclusivity within the education system in The Gambia.",['Icon of SDG 04'],"Africa,Goal 4  Quality education,Gambia,Blog post,English"

A major challenge faced by the government was the need for business continuity whilst maintaining the covid protocols such as social distancing. Thus there was need to develop ways of virtual outreach to the various stakeholders including traders, buyers, and service providers; and data on the types of goods traded and revenue generated. To address these issues, AccLabGM was recruited to support a digitization aspect for the Lumos that was piloted in one of the principal trading regions, hence creating an opportunity for our work on informalities; and informal markets particularly.-Building on an impact assessment of Covid-19 on the Lumos by the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS), AccLabGM set out to develop a digital marketplace for traders and buyers, which resulted in the creation of the MyLumo App. GBoS disaggregated data on trader information facilitated  the creation of electronic profiles of the traders. Once registered on the platform and the goods and services also uploaded with price and other relevant details, online trading could easily be facilitated as a form of e-commerce with an inbuilt online payment system using mobile money. This first step ensured that we increased the frequency of trading from weekly to daily markets and addressed the issue of business continuity when closures or other business limiting policies are being enforced.-Promoting Digital Literacy using E-Commerce, E-Delivery, and IVR-Our intervention were always planned with scale up considerations factored into the design. For this reason, we also pushed the limits of the platform to cater for two other objectives in the lumo reopening project. Specifically, we wanted to contribute to the marketing infrastructure upgrades at these spaces as part of the recovery process, and secondly, to provide opportunities to build the resilience of women and youth. The closure adversely affected the livelihoods of approximately 50,000 rural women and their families as Lumos provide markets for their agricultural goods as well as being their main source of goods that they purchase and retail in their respective communities. Overall, between 60% and 90 % or rural women are engaged in agriculture as their major source of livelihood whilst between 8% and 30% are engaged in sales and services.-Following field visit to the lumos in Region one, where the digital component would be piloted, the developers of the platform incorporated an agent and home delivery option for users of the platform. The agent model catered for traders with smart phones but had little to no tech-literacy by allowing them to register and upload their goods onto the platform at a commission. This ensured that no one would be excluded from the platform. The visit also informed our incorporation of a motorcycle courier service into the output on digitization with the introduction of a delivery option for users of the mobile app. It will be particularly useful for users who could not visit the lumo on trading days, but also for those not residing in a particular region where the lumo is taking place, to order for and receive goods. (Note: there are a total of 30 lumos in The Gambia.) This helps to change the transportation service industry in and around the lumos by expanding the motorcycles within the network which also includes horse and donkey carts as well as creating employment for young people.-Besides the agent model, to further cater to non-literates, an Interactive Voice Recorder (IVR) is also being incorporated into the system, and will allow buyers to interact with an operator in local languages to participate in the trading via USSD.-Launching the MyLumo platform-The introduction of the IVR immediately shifted the project in scale up mode. We saw a silver lining in our support to the UN System in the Gambia Health response team, which included the Ministry of Health, and their collective challenge to sensitizing communities on the COVID-19 nationwide vaccine campaign. Our intervention used a planned SDG localization film screening and MyLumo app launch, to create a Building Forward Better tour during which we distributed vaccine sensitization posters around the country. On March 25, we embarked on a 10 day tour in partnership with our app developers, the National Youth Parliamentarians Network, and a popular musical theatre group which created the theme song for our MyLumo platform. At the summit of the tour, our efforts were presented to the wider UNDP global audience as part of the 2021 Istanbul Innovation Days session on Innovation in the Informal Economy – What do policy-makers need to know?-The tour included a 10,000-cloth mask and 1000 print ‘tour’ t-shirt giveaway, live performances, and raffles, and reached 13 communities throughout the Gambia. The venue sites included pop-up locations, community markets, and of course lumos. Over 5000 individuals were sensitized in the process with the caravan leaving behind COVID vaccine “what to know?’ posters across all community centers and posts. The tour helped the developers of the platform identify and establish more flexible, effective, and efficient goods delivery channels in remote communities.-Finally, to introduce the platform in urban Gambia, we hosted a pop-up market at which we invited traders from the regions to give visitors an actual experience of how we helped to digitally transform the lumos. With the launching of the IVR, an accompanying app music video and mini-drama, the lumos are well positioned to continue trading online, should another lockdown be introduced in future. We anticipate that up to 80 jobs will be created when the system is fully launched, and that over 50 percent of that will be rural based jobs.-Since the launching of the tour on March 26, more than 100 users have already downloaded the MyLumo app with over 50 active agents. Furthermore, the digital e-commerce platform helps to limit the possibility of physical personal interactions and we are confident that both the local and relevant national government authorities including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health, are better positioned to now mitigate the impact of created by the closure of the lumos.-We also know that they are eager to support the scale out of the app to other regions and platforms as well as other programmes. In a program integration effort, another UNDP project on social protection  supporting women in animal husbandary, will benefit from the MyLumo platform where the animals will be showcased for sale.   -Share your feedback on how we approached informal market digitization online using #AccLabGM.- - ","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12']","Africa,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Gambia,English"

This concluding second part explores the steps towards potentially realizing the transformation of that hot-zone into a cluster.-Several arguments could be made in favor of the innovation spaces springing up around the GBA (part 1), but there aren’t quite as many counter arguments as to the impact they have had in our communities – whether realized or anticipated. In the wider local context, they are simply not understood, and perhaps it is all due to the novelty of their as a phenomenon. After a 2-3 year opportunity to observe these entities, their role, at least in the short term, can be critiqued somewhat more comprehensively, thus forming a basis to debate their necessity in our local economy in the first place.-The introduction of the technology labs and spaces sought to disrupt the internet industry by creating new internet access points that would rival the dominant market capture enjoyed by the popular cyber ‘internet’ cafes. However, despite the edge they should have enjoyed, mobile data and smartphones, have achieved that disruption at an unprecedented rate unmatched by these new spaces.-Besides the ‘newness’ of this all, and the obvious role they play by providing access to resources such as reliable internet and electricity, they are also accessible to entrepreneurs at very flexible rates – even comparable to rates at cyber cafes. Yet despite the incentives, surprisingly none of the four existing creative spaces is operating at more than 40 percent capacity. With great flexibility and healthy competition in the rates offered for access to the spaces, in some cases even catering for hourly use, the lack of usage and inflow of members needed to sustain the spaces is limiting their effectiveness.-Managers of these spaces need to also explore other untapped resources to enhance their roles in the wider ecosystem and seize the gains provided by the diminishing reliance of cyber cafes. By looking inward, the program and events pillar introduced in part one, can easily be explored to further incentivize entrepreneurs. Competition, challenges, programs, and networking event opportunities in particular need to become more available and accessible. This will also facilitate opportunities to access seed funding to support start-ups and other early-stage venture.-Part one of this blog series, revealed that in at least one of the technology labs and creative spaces, two groups within its membership pool were registered there as a result of an external competition i.e. the KMC Innovation Challenge. A similar percentage constitutes returnee-run startups or scale-ups, and the outstanding 20 percent of members categorize local bootstrapped financed ventures. With various reasons why this second group chose that space, greater availability to events and programs will only improve their experience and foster innovation capabilities. Collectively, this quality element must be prioritized above expanding the lab’s member base.- -Notably, the number of talent one can target within the Kanifing Municipal Council (KMC) is limited. Creative individuals residing in other regions must be exposure to these spaces through awareness creation. Media channels and platforms are a great and cost-effective way to achieve this. Tapping into academic settings such as the University of The Gambia (UTG) can spark greater interest in these spaces and facilitate access to a diverse and representative student body among other actors within that network. For instance, creating a role for academics will diversify the role of actors with the ecosystem e.g. by facilitate a role for researchers in the hot-zone to contribute to knowledge generation and capture, in these spaces.- -The governance structures that be, must also use policymaking as a tool to attract talent to The Gambia and the GBA innovation hot-zone in particular. Essentially, if the quality is improved, the quantity in numbers will be easier to attract. The profile of The Gambia offers a lot to not just its immediate regional ECOWAS neighbors, but the whole of Africa, especially with the ratification of the African Continent Free Trade Agreement ( AfCFTA). The country has the ingredients to attract top talent to establish their businesses here, not because there isn’t enough home-grown talent to occupy the spaces, but simply because the AfCFTA presents wider economic and commercial opportunity that will help further nurture the budding entrepreneurship ecosystem.-International competitions, challenges, programs, and events like Seedstars World are accessible to local entrepreneurs seeking to develop their ideas and businesses. Together with local equivalents like the KMC Innovation Challenge, these events must increase in frequency but with a new twist. The new technology labs and spaces have to serve the purpose of venue – something that has never been done before. Programs also need to cater to the rural residents of the country and the managers of these spaces have to find ways to penetrate this rural urban divide. Furthermore, they must connect to regional structures and networks like the AfriLabs network to tap into international opportunities.-Recently, through The Gambia Ministry of Information and Communication Infrastructure (MOICI) the national government embarked on conducting a feasibility study to establish an innovation lab at the national university. Besides the UTG, other tertiary institutions should also be tapped into as potential new sources of talent. The entrant of the public sector through this planned lab, would complete the blueprint of an innovation cluster that can easily be replicated in another region of the country at other popular cities such as Farafenni and Basse in the Upper River Region.-In the meantime, AccLabGM will build on the television advert it created for the four technology labs and spaces in the country by intervening with its own catalog of competitions, challenges, programs and events. This builds on the 3-day hackathon and collective intelligence workshops we hosted in 2020, among other events such as collective intelligence and sense-making workshops.-In a later piece, AccLabGM will explore the implications of the establishment of UTG’s new lab in our local context. Given an existing MOU between UNDP and the center of learning, AccLabGM will be keenly following along the whole process.-And you can too with #AccLabGM.- ",['Icon of SDG 09'],"Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Gambia,Blog post,English,Accelerator Labs"

What’s their objective, you might wonder: to provide an enabling environment for budding entrepreneurs to co-work and network. The test of whether or not their solutions have contributed to the spread of innovations in The Gambia is still ongoing. Even then, asking whether these spaces are the right fit for our own local landscape is too soon to answer, but certainly not too soon to reflect upon. Since they are here though, AcclabGM being in its overarching omnipotent umbrella position, has the unique opportunity to provide a platform for that conversation.-The four labs are all located in the heart of the Greater Banjul Area (GBA) in urban Gambia. With over 10,000 registered businesses, perhaps this comes as no surprise. They are all within a four-mile radius of each other, enclosed in what one can consider an innovation hot-zone in all but name. The Kanifing Municipal council recognizes this fact and in 2020, hosted its first ever Innovation Challenge in partnership with the Youth Empowerment Project (YEP), and the Gambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). Both the winner and runner up in the challenge are housed at the Disruptive Lab – one of the four spaces. -These labs all came into being within one year of each other, with the exception of JokkoLabs (Co-Work Lab). Various characteristics such as location, programmatic areas, and funding source, separate these labs but they are all bound by their target demographic besides the neighborhood that they share. An innovation ecosystem in The Gambia can hugely benefit from the labs existing in the local landscape. This real-time experimentation with technology or creative labs has already tied in the public sector (with the National Youth Council Lab), an international network (with JokkoLabs), the private sector with both an internationally financed (through Innovate Gambia), and a domestically financed venture (in The Hub) vying for the same market of 320,000 residents within the Kanifing municipality. AccLabGM also brings the presence of an international organization in the United Nations (UN), and UNDP in particular.-Considering the landscape actors, the missing engagement of academia, mainly the national University of the Gambia (UTG), is sorely needed in this space. It is perhaps only a matter of time before the innovation landscape players entice this center of learning into its midst. If this is realized and a similar space is created within an academic setting, it will usher in a different iteration of the ‘labs experiment’ wherein The Gambia will be well positioned to really explore what it means to develop an innovation ecosystem. The move would also provide a blueprint that would facilitate the creation of another innovation hot-zone given the sparsely spread UTG campus throughout the GBA with its main campus in Faraba (a city in another area council).-Meanwhile within the existing hot-zone, opening up support to several pillars can truly nurture it for the anticipated scaling out to other areas. Besides the creative and technology labs or spaces for innovation (Pillar One), other pillars include data accessibility; data affordability; and programme and events (including competitions, challenges, and networking events). Collectively, these four pillars are centrally reinforced by a dynamic and creative up-and-coming labor force. Once performance in each of these areas is optimized to create the coveted enabling environment for the benefit of the entrepreneurs, a next set of pillars will become apparent for the ecosystem to tackle and build together as part of a new iteration of the ‘labs experiment.’ Although at that level, the desired output would be for the benefit of the entire economy. Overtime, the unharnessed potential of the new labor force entrants could also prove to be transformative.-This is precisely why the ongoing AccLabGM experiment to promote business continuity during crises and the sharing of digital technology platforms that can support that process, is important. The 13-part High Tech Show is a series airing on the major television stations with advertisements of ongoing and planned AccLabGM projects or experiments. One of the advertisements showcases all four creative technology labs or spaces in a bid to entice the hidden gems of the country to step forward and utilize them in their business operations. The series is also a collective experience in solutions mapping.-Join the viewing and catch an episode this weekend.  -A separate set of issues have also been identified stemming from the low occupancy rate of these spaces. Part 2 of this series explores how that can be tacked differently.  - - - ","['Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Blog post,Gambia,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

However, coordinating cooperation for success can be challenging. This situation was faced in all circles when the COVID pandemic hit. Whether among high-level decision makers such as leaders and executives, teams, or simply at home management duos, an adjustment was needed for us all to cope. Workflow management tools are far from perfect, but they can be useful in improving communication and in turn, efficiency during such periods.-When the Gambia registered its first few COVID cases in March while the country office was testing an alternating remote Work From Home (WFH) system, AccLabGM intervened by sharing with UNDP staff tools that would ease the adjustment process on telecommuting. These tools shared in the form of an email quickly circulated outside of UNDP and made its way to other UN agencies including the UN Resident Coordinator Office. This marked the start of when other agencies really sparked an interest in the Lab, prior to which was still seen as a grey spot in the larger development framework.-This breakthrough was solidified with a blogpost on possible responses to COVID which set the groundwork for our collaborations for much of the year, starting with the UNDP Programme Units. What was supposed to be a gradual adjustment to eventually working with the UN Country Team, was accelerated with a request from WHO and UNICEF to AccLabGM to understand our insights on improving workflow efficiency at the inter-agency level during the pandemic. An opportunity presented itself to test a lab method, and a prize challenge was chosen in response.-The results of a 48-hour prize challenge to develop a functional demo of workflow efficiency and communication tool were presented to all members of the UN Country Team. A working group comprising of an interagency band of IT and Communications staff from UNDP, UNICEF, and UNFEA, chaired by AccLabGM, would select a vendor to develop a Content Management System (CMS) for this purpose. Concurrently a UNDP COVID Coordination Group was also supporting the government through the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) to develop a similar project to create a crisis dashboard tool.-The Lab has developed several learnings from these two projects including on the ease of facilitating cooperation at a very high level; decision making; the appropriate digital tools involved in that coordination process; and on user driven vs process driven solutions. Criss-crossing the learnings as best practices in both processes have been a major factor in the execution of these projects, but more importantly in their evolution. That has been most apparent in role delegation, partnerships development, and solutions and beneficiary mapping.-A data source for the UN Country Team CMS platform dashboard section exists through the Ministry of Health COVID 19 tracker and WHO data. An element to introduce automation to that process was being explored when the UNDP Crisis Bureau was presented to the global Accelerator Lab network. AccLabGM quickly engaged the Bureau to explore how their services could be applied to the project to enhance the dashboard feature on the platform. As this integration is being explored, the NDMA crisis dashboard tool is also being pursued with the inclusion of other, new agencies; this time FAO and WFP, with AccLabGM playing its favored integrator role alongside UNDP’s Environment Unit. Provided the needed capabilities at NDMA are in place, a data scarcity issue can be avoided, leading to timely and efficient coordination around crises situations.-As these two projects evolve, what is visualized is two dashboards operating in parallel, contributing to the efficiency of cooperation at the UN level, but also with our main partner i.e. the national government, through NDMA in this instance. Hopefully, this will give us a new understanding of complexity and how to manage it, but also insights on parallel thinking within systems and data science.-How does data visualization enhance your work?

The main challenge in the labor market is a shortage of jobs. Attempts to digitize the job matching experience were introduced in the market and when AccLabGM came into being in 2019, it sought to understand the implications of digitally transforming the process.-By partnering with job-matching platform, GamJobs, the lab sought to understand: whether if youths were directly contacted about available vacancies, there would be more competitiveness among that demographic for skills and professional development training program; and secondly, whether if we created an open access point for available vacancy notifications, then uptake of local job opportunities would rise in the short term. This blog explores the findings from that experiment.-Guided by a Lab challenge of youth unemployment, AccLabGM began its experimentation cycle with an SMS Jobs Alert Promotional Media Campaign. Tracing back to the first national study around a national platform for employment networking and action,* a survey into existing UNDP beneficiaries helped the Lab identify GamJobs as a key implementing partner. Coincidentally, it was also the frontrunner player in market efforts to digitize vacancy announcements. A popular youth entertainment group, Bright Stars Entertainment (BSE), was contracted to provide the campaign media.-In designing the alerts, AccLabGM purchased 500 subscriptions from GamJobs and a short-code service to streamline the user registration process and facilitate bulk SMS alerts of vacancy announcements. For the media campaign, BSE created an 80 second radio jingle that would be aired on two major radio stations during peak rush hour. Stand billboards and poster advertisements were placed in strategic locations and key transit points around the country to ensure reach.-AccLabGM entered the first month of the campaign eager and curious to learn from the results and what could be adjusted to inform an iterative process in the experiment design. Among the adjustments made was a re-strategizing of where and how we placed the poster adverts and the creation of a video for the radio jingle. We also increased our alerts subscriptions for our bulk SMS (short code) distribution after finding out that the demand for alerts that we received exceeded our supply of SMS subscriptions by 100 percent. Even more encouraging was the 100 percent conversation rate of vacancies advertised to filled positions.-The positive effect of our interventions to tackle the issues of reach, did not address all the challenges in the campaign. In March 2020, the disruptions posed by COVID-19 also created challenges to the experiment. Reduced office hours and a crunch in the job market translated to fewer jobs available for posting, despite the use of television and social media following the release of the jingle video. Regardless, 100 percent of vacancies posted were filled on a monthly basis during the entirety of the five-month campaign with an increase in the active user base of GamJobs by over 1000 percent.-Ultimately, the campaign findings also informed of a need to run a jobs drive campaign. It exposed regions were no job announcements were made, that no vacancies were shared by the public sector, or that in The Gambia, men were more likely to use digital technologies over women. These findings can potentially inform program design and implementation at the country office level, such as the need for more digital literacy among women and girls as a result of their emphasis on outreach by phone over digital platforms in this experiment.-AccLabGM is currently exploring a jobs supply oriented version of this experiment with slightly different parameters. Following the release of a Customer Relations Managment (CMR) survey to employers within GamJobs’ userbase, AccLabGM decided to purchase three subscription packages which also factored in the findings from the alerts campaign. To maximize on the number of jobs posted, these packages were offered to the Gambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), The Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (TANGO), and finally, the Public Service Commission (PSC) of government. Taxi billboards are also being used to directly incentive users within those networks to become active.-These attempts to better understanding development, could pivot our approach to how we pursue and ultimately attain the SDGs. Whether its ‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’ (SDG 8) or ‘Reduced Inequalities’ (SDG 10), this experiment tried to offer a few insights on the challenge of youth unemployment in The Gambia. AccLabGM remains ever-curious and ever-ready to explore and test new ideas and exploit new to market innovations in country.-Would these results hold in your city or state?

One of the main challenges facing the Rule of Law sector is case backlog, particularly for remand prisoners and the consequential impact on the Prison Services. With a total of 621 inmates, more than half of the prison population are on remand. Even before the impact of COVID-19, it was imperative to decongest the Prisons.-The COVID-19 outbreak combined with the poor sanitation facilities and overcrowding of the Remand Wing of Mile 2 Prison raised a red flag of the Prisons becoming an epicenter or super spreader of the virus. To decongest the Remand Wing, the UNDP initiated a partnership with the Judiciary for the establishment of Virtual Courts.-In this regard, the Chief Justice established an Interagency Task Force (IATF) to review legislative or constitutional impediments for establishing a Virtual Court. The IATF was comprised of the Judiciary (Chair), Ministry of Justice, the Police Force, the Prisons Service, the National Agency for Legal Aid, The Gambia Bar Association, the National Drug and Law Enforcement Agency and UNDP. Several consultations were convened with recommendations on piloting and a position paper on the legislative and Constitutionality of the Virtual Court submitted to the Office of the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice approved the establishment of 2 Virtual High Courts for civil and criminal cases and issued Practice Directives to the stakeholders.-The first Virtual Court hearing was held on Wednesday, 10 June 2020. A total of 55 cases have been heard, 13 criminal matters and 42 civil matter as of 15 July 2020. The cases of detainees are heard daily before two Virtual High Courts per day. The Chief Justice is considering adding two more High Courts per day, totaling four to the Virtual Court and extending the pilot to the Magistrate level.-Virtual Court Hearing showing: High Court Judge, Defense Counsel, inmates, Court secretary and UNDP observer-Based on an assessment on ICT needs for the operationalization of the Virtual Court with partners, UNDP provided facilitated Internet access for the Prison Service and the National Agency for Legal Aid to facilitate engagement with the Virtual Court. UNDP through its AccLabGM, provided technical support including ZOOM to the IATF team, installed equipment at the Prisons Service, completed connectivity tests to ensure the internet connection for the Virtual Court is adequate for proceedings.-ZOOM platform was made available for participants to the Virtual Court and connectivity ensured for the Prisons so that inmates could be present in Court virtually. Additional IT material and furniture were also provided through the supported Prison Legal Aid Desks which were already outfitted with desktop computers, desks and chairs in Mile 2 and Jeshwang Prisons.-Preliminary Virtual Court hearing-The emergence of the virtual court system in the Gambia would significantly transform the Judiciary especially court proceedings. In the past, many Court cases were adjourned for a longer period due reasons such as absence of a Judge, logistics constraints in transporting detainees to the courts and prosecutors caught up in other official matters. With the current virtual court deployment, Judges can preside over cases virtually without being physically present in the courtroom, and this applies to both the prosecution and defense council. The logistics constraint could no more be a reason for adjournment as detainees would not be required to be physically present in the court room. As the optimism grow with the success of the new virtual court initiative and the Chief Justice’s consideration of expanding the deployment to the lower courts, this could be one of the breakthroughs that transforms Gambia Judiciary system beyond the COVID 19 pandemic and ensure that citizens have timely access to Justice.",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Africa,Blog post,Gambia,Data Innovation,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,English,Accelerator Labs"

Within a month, the number has risen to 25 cases with 6 active. The slow rate of case identification resulted in heightened concerns and fear within communities. Expectedly, youth entrepreneurs and local innovators emerged with solutions in response to the pandemic. Several awareness campaigns were initially launched, and measures exemplified in other countries were adopted locally. Some key interventions we encountered include the creation of makeshift bucket-taps, production of hand sanitizers, homemade face masks, and plans to leverage on digital technologies for contact tracing. To capture these community responses and map emerging solutions, our journey led to stronger partnerships both within and outside the UN System.-Adopting health and safety measures-Supporting the production of homemade (cloth) face masks-Since nations across the world are adapting this basic line of defense as an additional layer of protection and reporting success, it is necessary that AccLabGM also incorporates these solutions into its pandemic response. With the scarce supply of medical resources, recommendations emerged from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO that promoted the use of non-medical (cloth) masks as a substitution to medical grade masks for non-health personnel.-Connecting through various networks, AccLabGM reached out to local entrepreneurs and institutions and formed strategic partnerships leading to the formation of a project to support youth and female entrepreneurs to produce and distribute cloth masks. Together, with current efforts of the International Trade Centre (ITC), the Ministry of Health and WHO, funds and approaches are integrated to help scale, standardize and ensure quality control whilst providing income generating opportunities particularly, for vulnerable businesses and female entrepreneurs.

With this in mind, AccLabGM served as a panelist on the European Union funded a GMD 1 million challenge championed by Kanifing Municipality Council (KMC) and Gambia Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) supported by ITC / Tekki fi partners. The challenge presented the ideal opportunity for a virtual solutions mapping of responses emerging from innovative young entrepreneurs to tackle socioeconomical challenges caused by the pandemic.

Nonetheless, it has opened up windows of opportunities in a virtual world, for example through challenges and hackathons to  continue engagements. What has also been demonstrated is the importance of digital readiness and the crucial role that technology can play in keeping our society functional. For The Gambia, the reality still remains that only a small percentage of the population can leverage the benefits of remote work, e-learning, mobile payments and online entertainment. Nonetheless, AccLabGM continues to call on all partners and innovators to leverage the opportunities presented by this pandemic as we work towards building The Gambia beyond COVID-19.- ",['Icon of SDG 09'],"Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Crisis response,Blog post"

On World Ocean Day, as we celebrate the critical role of oceans in our everyday life, we are reminded that we all have a role to play in protecting our common future.-Protecting oceans protects our future-Our future depends on keeping our oceans healthy. The ocean economy contributes up to USD3 trillion every year to the global economy and 3 billion people depend on the oceans for their livelihoods. In Ghana, the fisheries sector employs about 20% of the labor force, almost 3 million people. The Oceans contribution to people, prosperity and keeping nature in balance are at risk from multiple stressors driven by human action.  Rising plastic pollution, overfishing and the impacts of climate change have a negative impact on marine environment and resources, livelihoods as well as food security. It is estimated that 9% of about 1.1million tonnes of plastic waste generated each year in Ghana leaks into water bodies.-Policies and collective actions-National policies and actions are important in driving collective action.  Ghana is a member of the High Level Panel on Oceans and has a robust policy framework for protecting ocean health in line with international agreements on ocean governance. The plastic management policy provides guidelines to tackle marine waste pollution, Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) fishing as well as promote the conservation of marine biodiversity.-Collective action is nurtured through partnerships and local action. The Ghana National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP), supported by UNDP  provides a platform for the government to work together with over 120  stakeholders to take action to combat plastic waste pollution.  Organizations like Plastic Punch, one of the winners of the first edition of UNDP’s Waste Recovery Innovation Challenge are working together with communities to clean up beaches and sensitize the public regularly. Ahead of this year’s World Ocean Day, Plastic Punch in collaboration with UNDP and the European Union (EU) Commission in Ghana mobilized over 250 communities including school children, volunteers and staff of the EU and UNDP for a beach clean-up and sensitization.-Collective actions will improve ocean benefits for people, planet and the economy-More is needed to sustain a healthy ocean economy with benefits for people, the planet and the economy in line with the High-Level Ocean Panel’s report launched in Accra in 2020.  -First, more effective collective action is needed to protect our oceans. Fostering stronger collaboration between actors at national, regional, local and community levels will reduce duplication and strengthen synergies. Partnerships with traditional, religious and community leaders,  the youth, women, CSOs, and the private and public sector enhances the sharing of data, information and best practices. Facilitating this multistakeholder collaboration means creating more spaces for joint learning, planning and resource mobilization for greater impact.  The Ghana Waste Recovery Platform and the NPAP are important vehicles for multi-stakeholder engagements.-Second, more ambitious advances in sustainable production will reduce waste and pollution. Plastic waste remains a significant challenge globally and in Ghana only 5% of all plastic generated every year is recycled.  Efforts to create a new balance by reducing consumption and production of plastic while creating greener alternatives can generate a triple win for people, planet and the economy. Advancing sustainable consumption and production across all productive sectors can also help to reduce carbon emissions and slow global warming and ocean acidification.-Third, we need to increase finance for ocean science and technology. By exploring innovative financing mechanisms and tools we can generate the resources required to advance equitable access to science and technology driven solutions. Blended financing approaches can help to unlock private sector financing by de-risking investments in innovative solutions to enhance food, energy and climate security . We must create an enabling environment to attract investment by reforming policies so that they support more equitable technology access and transfer. More investments in scientific research will  help to guide appropriate mitigation and adaptation actions.-UNDP is committed to fostering partnerships for inclusive collaboration to ensure the protection and sustainable use of our ocean’s resources towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 14 on life below water and all the SDGs.-To realize the promise of a healthy ocean that supports people, the planet and our economy, we must scale up ocean action now.  Ghana is well-positioned to revitalize the ocean economy through collective action supported by effective protection, sustainable production and increased ocean finance.",['Icon of SDG 14'],"Goal 14  Life below water,Angela Lusigi,Ghana,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Blog post,English"

The most recent Global Peace Index indicates an average decline in global peacefulness in at least 73 countries. Countries in conflict or recovering from conflict rank lower in UNDP’s Human Development Index. The negative development implication of declining peace is compounded by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic that triggered new forms of internal pandemic-related conflict and violence with growing tensions and civil unrest. This persistent and changing nature of conflict requires a pivot towards empowering peacemakers, protectors and peacekeepers in order to build and sustain peace.-Representation is often overlooked in peace processes-On International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, as we honor men and women who serve as military, police or civilians in UN Peacekeeping operations, it is time to have a conversation about representation.  Women, youth and representatives from groups who are disproportionately affected by conflict and violence are currently underrepresented in peace processes. Twenty-two years after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, participation of women in peacekeeping operations and conflict resolution processes is still low. UN records show that in 2020, out of approximately 95,000 peacekeepers, women constituted only 4.8% of military contingents, 10.9% of formed police units and 34% of justice and corrections personnel in UN Peacekeeping missions. Currently, women in field missions constitute only 6.6%. Similarly, The Council on Foreign Relations indicates that during the period 2015-2019, women constituted only 14 percent of negotiators in major peace processes.-Women play an important role in sustaining peace-Having more women engaged in peace processes not only helps in achieving gender parity but is key to achieving the SDGs. Research shows that participation of women increases the probability of a peace agreement being implemented and lasting longer. According to the UN, women peacekeepers are important because they are perceived to be more ‘accessible’ than men hence have greater access to communities; they provide unique skillsets and alternative viewpoints that may contribute to overall operational effectiveness; they serve as role models and mentors to other women and girls especially in conflict and post-conflict settings.-Africa has made commendable progress in inclusion-In Africa, Ghana has made significant strides in increasing women’s participation in peace negotiations, peacekeeping activities, and preventive diplomacy.  For instance, the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Accra supported by UNDP and the Japanese government offers courses based on the pillars of Resolution 1325.-Female Ghanaian peacekeepers are also at the frontline of several UN peacekeeping missions such as South Sudan and South Lebanon. Irene Larbi, a 25-year-old Ghanian woman serving in South Sudan is one of them. While this is her first peacekeeping mission, Irene was the youngest recipient of the UN Medal for outstanding service. She describes her work as being ‘challenging and exciting’. With 115 women peacekeepers, Ghana is the contingent with the highest number of women peacekeepers in the South Lebanon Mission.-Other countries like Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone have also seen women act as agents of change by participating in dialogues for peace and advocating for women’s rights during and after the conflicts. In the 2016 African Human Development Report on Gender Equality, Nobel Laureate Leymah Gbowee describes how during the war in Liberia women mobilised for peace through advocacy, mass protests and sit-ins, military action and petitions. Their efforts contributed to the signing of the peace agreement that officially ended the war.-A forward looking agenda calls for collective action-Given the opportunity, African women can help build a peaceful, secure and resilient continent. To achieve true inclusion in sustaining peace, there is need for the following decisive actions at local, national and international levels.-Going forward, “Only inclusive engagement of both women and men is likely to lead to sustainable peace, as wide representation will better ensure that the emerging peace is owned by both females and males, and their needs and perspectives are included” (AfHDR, 2016). Similarly, “the achievements of the SDGs will be meaningless without the existence of peace as emphasised by SDG16” (UNDP Ghana).

A UN Resolution adopted in 2017 recognises these two aspects as being essential for ‘harnessing the economic potential of nations and creating momentum for the achievement of SDGs by transforming society, creating jobs and expanding opportunities for all, including women and youth’. The significance of creativity and innovation in driving sustainable development is evident in the fact that they are prominent in five of the 17 goals (8, 9, 11, 12, 17). Their importance was further highlighted when the UN designated 2021 as ‘the International Year of Creative Economy for Sustainable Development’ with the aim to acknowledge, promote and accelerate the economic and social contributions of the creative economy to the Sustainable Development Goals.-In a report co-published by UNDP and UNESCO, human creativity and innovation are recognised as the true wealth of nations in the twenty first century. UNESCO refers to creativity as the ‘industry of tomorrow’. Today, digitization is helping more people to turn their ideas into products, services, and revenue streams to sustain their livelihoods. According to UNCTAD, the ‘Creative Economy’ is growing faster than other industries and is projected by the think tank G20 Insights to reach a global valuation of $985 billion by 2023 and could represent 10 percent of global GDP before 2030.-Citizens are generating a wide variety of creative products that contribute to Africa’s growth exports and boost development outcomes. A good example is Nigeria’s film industry (“Nollywood”) which produces over 2,000 films per year and employs more than one million people.-Craft Education, an edtech innovation by Ghanaian social entrepreneur Rudolph Ampofo is another example. In a continent where children with disabilities such as learning and social communication delays including autism are often marginalised by the education system, Rudolph is using creativity and innovation to create more inclusive and equitable access to education. His behaviour therapy and special needs platform links parents and teachers with certified professionals through their mobile devices and provides the training and support required to give impacted children a better quality of life.-26-year-old Charlette N’Guessan, an Ivorian based in Ghana, is another budding innovator and the first woman to win the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation (2020). Charlette and her team developed BACE API, a software that uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence to verify identities remotely, and one that is designed specifically to identify Africans. By offering remote identification, the innovation addresses the challenge of unequal access to ID’s which disproportionately affects women making them unable to access basic socio-economic and legal rights including healthcare, education, voting, legal protection in court and entering the formal economy.-While there is growing appreciation of the social and economic value of creativity and innovation in Africa, both are undervalued in policy debates.-Creating an enabling environment for creation and innovation will transform lives. Steps to unlock the financial and regulatory challenges faced by the creative industry can help to harness the continent’s creative and innovative potential but require a whole of society approach with actions by policymakers, society and individuals.-Policymakers must recognize the value of creative businesses and invest accordingly. According to OECD, policymakers need to integrate the creative sector into national and local development policies. They need to understand the opportunities and challenges of the sector and use them as the basis for planning and policymaking. A particular area of focus should be to increase the financial sustainability of the sector by enhancing access to credit, venture capital and other instruments. A study by UNDP calls on policymakers to develop policies that accelerate and sustain a dynamic creative economy. By recognising and addressing constraints and regulatory structures, African countries can keep pace with the rapid evolution of the creative economy/sector.-Similarly, society must identify practical strategies and approaches that foster creativity and critical thinking in young people beginning at primary and secondary education levels. It is important to foster reward systems to recognise and appreciate creativity and innovation. Greater efforts should be made to protect intellectual property rights in order to properly reward creators.-Finally, individuals need to take advantage of the low barriers to entry, inclusiveness and agility of the creative economy to create new products, services and revenue streams. Young people are already at the forefront of the creative sector and should be encouraged to reach for the stars.-Creativity and Innovation help us solve existing problems in new and imaginative ways by influencing how we view the world (the possibilities), how we think (the barriers we place on ourselves), and what we can or are able to do. As we continue to deal with the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we need both creative thinking and innovation to imagine ourselves out of the situations we find ourselves in and catapult us to the next level of our global journey to sustainable development.- ",['Icon of SDG 09'],"Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Angela Lusigi,Ghana,Sustainable development,Blog post,English"

It is projected that there is likely to be a global 40% groundwater deficit by 2030. This is expected to reduce global GDP by 6% in some regions of the world by 2050.-In Ghana like many other developing countries, most of the volume of water withdrawn for domestic use including drinking water and water for irrigation purposes comes from groundwater sources. Ghana’s efforts to improve access to water have borne fruit and about 92% of Ghanaians have access to improved water sources.  In rural areas such as in the  Yindongo community in the Upper East region of Ghana,  Madam Agabeni Abaa and the other 100 women have improved their livelihoods through dry season gardening powered by groundwater sources. Partnerships between the Government, UNDP and the Adaptation Fund that enable access to groundwater, are changing lives in underserved communities in the Savannah region and four Northern regions of Ghana. It is reducing the time women like Fatima and Alimatu spend and the distance they travel in search of water.-Yet the theme for this year’s world water day reminds us that, availability and access to groundwater are at risk and must be protected. With the ongoing climate emergency and its associated impacts such as the changes in recharge and evapotranspiration patterns, groundwater resources will become increasingly stressed leading to a potential acceleration in groundwater depletion.-Human activities such as indiscriminate disposal of harmful substances and chemicals on the soil and other activities like illegal mining activities continue to undermine the value of groundwater, making it more vulnerable to depletion and pollution with its associated economic cost. For example, the World Bank Ghana Country Environmental Analysis estimates about 1.8 billion losses annually due to water pollution, equivalent to about 3% of Ghana’s GDP. In the context of the alarming risk of missing the SDG 6 targets as reported by the 2020 SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework progress report coupled with the global climate crisis, urgent action is needed to sustainably manage underground water resources.-Three key things need to urgently happen:-As the world considers a future under more water stress, Ghana is well-positioned to sustainably manage its water resources above and below ground. This can be done through strategic local level actions, more equitable and inclusive water resource management, and collaborative partnerships on data and digitalization. UNDP, working as part of the UN in Ghana, remains committed to our partnerships towards sustainable management of water resources and the acceleration of Ghana’s achievement of the SDGs.

We hold it in trust for future generations”. This year, as we mark the Intentional Day of Forests, we are reminded of the importance of halting the continuous decline in forest resources. The theme for this year, “Forests and sustainable production and consumption"" is apt as sustainable management and use of forest resources are key to combating climate change, and to contributing to the prosperity and well-being of current and future generations.-Forests cover nearly a third of the earth’s surface and support the livelihoods of more than 1.5 billion people around the world. Yet, 80% of natural forests have either been cleared or degraded with the world losing over 12 million hectares of primary forests between 2019 and 2020. In Ghana, according to data from the Global Forest Watch, the country has lost an equivalent of 8% of total tree cover between 2002 and 2020. With the current annual deforestation and forest degradation rate of 2% - equivalent to 135,000 hectares loss of forest cover – Ghana’s tropical forests continue to face the danger of depletion if efforts at sustainable management are not strengthened.-The Government of Ghana is already taking bold and commendable steps to reduce forest loss through interventions such as the Ghana Cocoa and Forests REDD+ Programme, the Ghana Landscape Restoration and Small Scale Mining Project and the Ghana Shea Landscape Emission Reductions Project. These interventions advance the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 through forest restoration, sustainable production, and consumption of green commodities across Ghana.-Ghana also joined over 100 world leaders who pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030 at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. This pledge reiterates and reaffirms the role of forests in balancing greenhouse gas emissions and removals. It will also help in adapting to the impacts of climate change, in maintaining healthy ecosystem services, and thus ensure sustainable use of the earth’s forest resources. This landmark declaration is timely as the world is faced with an uncertain future according to a recent assessment report on the world’s forests.-Driven by unclear land and tree tenure systems, and unsustainable agricultural practices, Ghana’s forest resources remain at risk. Cocoa production contributes between 54-77% of the country’s forest degradation. Initiatives like the Cocoa Life Programme being implemented by UNDP, Cocoa Board, Forestry Commission, with support from Mondelez International, are providing solutions by promoting sustainable agricultural production. Through the programme, farmers like Grace and Naomi are helping to restore degraded forest reserves like the Ayum Forest Reserve by planting economic trees in degraded forest reserve land. Similarly, farmers like Moses and Ama are not only reaping the benefits of joining other farmers to plant over 1 million economic trees in their cocoa farms but are also contributing to efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.-Advancing sustainable production and consumption in forested areas will require turning declarations and pledges into concrete actions. These actions must respond to current and future challenges to drive the kind of transformative changes required to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. The actions must also be far-reaching and more inclusive in three key areas.-First, promote green forest-related commodities. With an enhanced and transparent approach to traceability of all green commodities, Ghana can unlock immense opportunities for people and the planet through sustainable production. Building on the work by the Ghana Cocoa Board in the cocoa sector, more can be done for other commodities such as shea and cashew.-Second, support inclusive commodity platforms to ensure that no one is left behind when it comes to engagement and decision making. Commodity stakeholder platforms are a key avenue for effective multi-stakeholder engagement. Bringing all actors -including women and youth - together on inclusive platforms should be explored to help address forest degradation across various supply chains and hold actors accountable to commitments.-Third, strengthen partnerships with the private sector and local communities. In Ghana, the cocoa private sector has already made clear commitments towards sustainable production and consumption through the Cocoa and Forest Initiative (CFI), which has been an ongoing partnership with the Government. It is important that, such partnerships are strengthened, and communities are engaged to ensure that related actions are effectively monitored and reported on.-In conclusion, if Ghana and other countries are to succeed in advancing forests and sustainable consumption and production, we must work to adopt sustainable agricultural practices, address land and tree tenure-related issues, and build collaborative platforms to ensure sustainable management of forests for people and for planet.-As we hold the forests in trust for future generations, we will also be able to enjoy all the benefits from the air we breathe, to the food we eat and medicines we use. Sustaining forests will sustain our life and livelihoods on earth.

According to UNESCO Science Report 2021, one in three researchers in science globally is a woman. In Africa, 30% of science professionals are women and female enrolment in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses is rising.-Yet women and girls are still underrepresented. Globally, only 12% of the members of science academies are women and they comprise only a quarter (28%) of tertiary graduates in engineering and 40% of computer sciences graduates. In Africa, the share of women fellows of the African Academy of Sciences is only 17%.-Ghana follows this trend; only 14% of all students attending university are female and women made up 26% of PhD graduates in 2018. This gender disparity is reflected in the leadership of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. The Academy has only had 3 women Presidents out of 20 in the 52-year history of the Academy. More needs to be done to bridge the country’s gender gap in science.-Women in science are real agents of change. They are already helping countries to accelerate achievement of all SDGs. Take the example of Prof Esi Ewuah, a fellow of the African Academy of Sciences and one of only three female fellows from Ghana. A winner of many awards, Prof Ewuah’s innovative research projects in engineering and science have helped to improve the environment, water, and sanitation in the country. Quakyi Isabella Akyinbah, a leading Bioscientist and Mary Chinery-Hesse are the other two fellows of the African Academy of Sciences from Ghana having blazed the trail and made significant impact in their respective fields.-Given the opportunity, women and girls can effectively contribute to development by providing solutions and fresh perspectives to existing challenges. Take the example of Miishe Addy and Regina Honu of Ghana who are among Africa’s female innovators of 2021. Mishe’s organisation uses digital technology to address shipping challenges on the continent, making trade more efficient and predictable and in turn providing income earning opportunities for thousands of people. Regina’s institution equips talented young women with the technical and soft skills required to land jobs in technology as a means of reducing the gender gap in the industry.-Educating girls in STEM enables them to achieve their potential and play an effective role in addressing development challenges. At 20 years of age, Janet Kekesi is on the way to achieving her dream of becoming ‘a top-notch engineer’ (UNDP story). She is currently an operating technician working at Ghana’s first mini-hydropower plant in Tsatsadu. Having more ‘Janets’ calls for starting young, targeting women, and investing more in women-led research.  -By starting young, we can encourage, equip, and mentor girls through initiatives such as the Miss Geek Africa/ Miss Geek Ghana to inspire girls to take up STEM courses and careers. Working with the Ministry of Communications, the Miss Geek Ghana competition provides young (13-21 years) female software app developers with business training and financial support to develop their socially innovative projects, addressing various challenges in Ghanaian society.
-Secondly, we must support women in science, to stay in science.  Working with academic institutions and employers, it is possible to provide professional support to women scientists through scholarships, mentoring programmes and gender-friendly policies so that women thrive.-Finally, let’s invest more in women-led innovations and fund women’s research to raise the level of venture capital directed towards women-founded start-ups from the current 2% globally (UNESCO Science Report 2021).-Having more women in science is a key driver for the achievement of Africa’s commitment to power sustainable development through science technology and innovation as captured in the African Union’s Science, Technology, and Innovation Strategy for Africa 2024. This is echoed in Ghana’s own National Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (2017-22).-UNDP is committed to supporting the participation of women as innovators and active contributors to sustainable development. The International Day of Women and Girls in Science celebrated annually on February 11th is a unique opportunity to rally our efforts, Together, we can narrow the gender gap in this field that is central in achieving the SDGs.-Let’s start by honouring our leading women in science who are already making a significant contribution and invest in attracting and retaining more women in science so we can transform Africa. Women leaders in the science field, especially those with ‘a seat at the table’, have an opportunity to exert their influence and power to encourage a levelling of the playing field and open doors for the next generation of female scientists.

For the first time, I felt like I'm beginning my professional career and I was so ecstatic about the great career opportunity.  -After coming to terms with what sounded like a dream of having to serve the UN, I expected nothing short of skills acquisition, personal and career development.  My little knowledge about UNDP’s work did not stop me from setting my expectations high as I am determined to learn, serve, and utilize such great opportunity to be part of the UN family.-The one-week orientation kick started with 21 of us introducing ourselves and the various departments we have been assigned to and our expectations, followed by series of sessions filled with inspiring and motivating takeaways. One key message that kept resonating from every speaker and kept echoing in our minds throughout the orientation was ""leverage this great opportunity to your advantage; learn, work hard, explore and network.”  Indeed, the speakers fed us with so many words of inspiration, wisdom, and love. The following are some key nuggets of lessons drawn from the various speakers throughout the orientation period.-Just before other speakers came to speak to us, the two HR Associates, Ms. Jill Quaye and Ms. Gifty Amuah, had a brief interaction with us.  I was a little nervous as I was highly clueless about what's expected of us during the orientation. As Ms. Jill Quaye spoke eloquently, her sense of humor towards us was so welcoming. One thing she mentioned was, humble yourself as you make yourself available to learn and explore. She requested that we draw our personal development goals plan and our expectations during the national service period to be able to track our progress at the end of the year. She also encouraged us to explore other units, in order to acquire more skills.-Then we had another presentation from Ms. Praise Nutakor, the Head of Communications and Partnerships. She highlighted the vision and goals of UNDP. She emphasized that UNDP’s work is seeking to support Ghana to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. She encouraged us to develop the right attitude to learn and always be ready to learn.-The security briefing by the United Nations Department for Safety and Security on the second day of the orientation was full of insights about personal and general security and safety issues that I believe many of us take for granted. I was so enlightened. He advised us to reflect the good image of the UN wherever we find ourselves. One key nugget from him was: take good care of yourself, network, and respect one another irrespective of the person’s position. This resonates well with one key principle of the UN: diversity.-On the third day, the Head of IT, Mr. Daniel Mills briefed us on how the IT Unit supports and ensures that every worker has tools ready to work. On her part, Ms. Gifty Amuah, the Human Resource Associate also briefed us on UNDP's Code of Conduct and Ethics. These include integrity, transparency, accountability, mutual respect, professionalism, and being result-oriented. The Gender Team Lead, Ms. Jennifer Asuako, took turns and highlighted the importance of empowering the youth, old, male and female as this goes a long way to help accelerate efforts towards the development of a country. She stated that, “when a youth is empowered, or takes charge of his or her life, he or she has the skills, critical awareness, and opportunities to positively impact life and the lives of other individuals, organizations, and communities”.  -Day four was another shining and daring one for all of us. We had the opportunity to meet the Resident Representative (RR), the Deputy Resident Representative (DRR), and the various team leads.-""Be focused and flexible. You have the power to direct how well you want your career to be. Don't leave your ideas outside, bring them to the table. Be organized"".-These were the words of Dr. Angela Lusigi, the UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana, as she shared her experience with us. Again, another nugget; ""Don't look down on the little tasks and the little things. Everything is important and must be treated with genuine seriousness and zeal"".-Finally, the Team Lead for Environment and Climate Change, Stephen Kansuk, stated that, “Every individual has a role to play to secure a better and brighter future towards their career advancement and a conscious effort needs to be done to be able to achieve it but a great opportunity like starting with a UN agency gives you the ladder to climb up”.  -The experience, the re-awakening of self-confidence, the inspiration, the ideas accrued from the orientation couldn't have been any better. I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity, and to UNDP. I look forward to a memorable experience with the UN.",['Icon of SDG 08'],"Ghana,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Sustainable development,Blog post,English"

This year’s special theme on, “recovering better for an equitable and sustainable world” is apt as the world continues to heal from the COVID-19 global pandemic.-Promoting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 on peaceful, inclusive, and just societies means that we must ensure that those hit hardest by the COVID pandemic are not left behind. People affected by conflict and crisis are particularly vulnerable and least able to cope and recover from the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.-Ensuring more equal access to health care and vaccines offers a pathway to building back stronger for a more equitable and sustainable world. While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries  need to vaccinate at least 40% of people by the end of 2021, and at least 70% by the first half of 2022, no African country is on track. Data provided by UNDP COVID-19 Data Futures Platform shows that 1 in 2 people (60.18%) are vaccinated in high income countries but only 1 in 33 in low income countries have received vaccines (3.07%).  Strengthening the health systems that power development will play a key role in building resilience to the instability created by current and future shocks.-Beyond health, COVID-19 has already had a negative impact on social cohesion and peace. In Ghana, a survey conducted by the Ghana Statistical Service in partnership with the UNDP in 2020 on the impact of COVID-19, shows a rise in crime, domestic violence, prices, and business closures. There has also been a surge in stigma, domestic violence, crime, discrimination, and inequity globally.-This year’s theme for the International Peace Day is a call to action for us to make peace with one another and with nature to build forward stronger and greener.-First, we must work in solidarity to build a more inclusive, equitable, and peaceful society. Now more than ever, we must strengthen our social bonds within and between communities and groups. We must strengthen our collaboration to find new solutions through dialogue and co-create our common future.-In Ghana, institutions such as the National Peace Council, the National Commission on Small Arms and Light Weapons, the National Commission for Civic Education and the Ghana Police Service contribute to a culture of peace, democratic consolidation, and respect for the rule of law. These are important assets to Ghana’s social and economic advancement that need to be nurtured.-Making peace with each other also means being deliberate about the involvement and participation of the youth in decision-making in peace processes at all levels. Initiatives such as UNDP’s 16x16, testifies to the positive impact young women and men can make in advancing peace.-We must also actively ensure the participation of women in peace processes at all levels and the protection, and promotion of the rights of women and girls. Building on the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR 1325), Ghana has developed its 2nd National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security. Implementing this plan would lead to more women playing a role in peacebuilding and conflict.-Second, as citizens we hold the power to live in peace with nature, on whose existence we depend. By re-orienting our social norms and values towards sustainable consumption and production as outlined in the 2020 UNDP Human Development Report,  we will be able to expand human freedoms while easing pressure on the planet. A green and sustainable global economy that produces jobs, reduces emissions, and builds resilience to climate impacts, will require a new generation of citizens, who are committed to restoring our degraded ecosystems and living at peace with nature.-This peace day, it is time to commit to advancing an inclusive and sustainable recovery from COVID-19, a recovery that places both people and nature at the centre for peace and lasting prosperity.-If we invest in young people, advocate for more equitable distribution of vaccines and mobilize communities, we will be able to build peace and reverse environmental degradation to accelerate the pace of our recovery. As individuals and as communities, let us uphold the values that protect the rights of all for a peaceful and just society.

As we celebrate World Youth Day on the special theme of “Transforming Food Systems: Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health”, this is an important occasion to celebrate some of them.-On average, many households across Ghana spend almost half of their total expenditure on food. This rises from 36% of household expenditures in Greater Accra to 50% in Brong Ahafo, Eastern, and Northern regions, according to the Ghana’s Living Standard Survey 7. Food also accounts for 17% of Ghana’s total import bill and already employs 30% of the population. It is estimated that 2 in 5 of every male employee and 1 in 5 for females, is employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  This means that encouraging more food system entrepreneurs can help to reduce the burden on households, national revenues and offer more employment opportunities.-Creating the ecosystem for young entrepreneurs to thrive would benefit from three key emerging lessons from food system entrepreneur in Ghana. There are young people in the agriculture value-chain, who have demonstrated the power of a great idea that is nurtured by tenacity, research and a solid support network.-First, they have demonstrated the need for tenacity and grit when emerging entrepreneurs are faced by roadblocks. Alhassan in Northern Ghana whose growing business produces hatcheries and trains farmers on guinea fowl rearing is a good example. He stayed in the game by turning challenges into opportunity. Fresh out of school with no prospects and very little starting capital, he was able to transform scrap metal from fridges into egg incubators.  He faced challenges with many unsuccessful attempts and technology barriers, but he did not give up. He was able to use the knowledge he had gained from his family and online research to find creative solutions to overcome his roadblocks.-Second, young entrepreneurs have shown the importance of being a meticulous and detailed oriented learner. It is important to have the capability for research and learning from others’ experiences to become an industry leader. As Fred Swaniker, a leading Ghanaian influencer affirms, we must all be entrepreneurial leaders with a lifelong learning mindset. -While a solid education is an important milestone, it must be complemented by knowledge that is being generated every day. This knowledge is freely accessible on digital platforms, in books and through experiences of people who have walked a similar path.  The example of the Prince and Sampare, who are processing tiger nuts sourced from Ashanti, Central, Eastern, and Northern regions using home grown technology shows the need to engage with academia and experts. -While networks and mentors are important guides, successful entrepreneurs are self-driven learners.
-Finally, as it is true in life, you cannot make it alone. Felix, who developed a thriving eco-friendly snail farming and vegetable business using greenhouses in the Greater Accra and the Ashanti Regions, is a great example. He was able to turn his idea into reality through the support of his family, UNDP, National Youth Authority, fellow entrepreneurs in Nigeria, Ashesi Design Lab, and Inno Hub Ghana. Felix benefited from this help to crystalize his innovation into an investment opportunity and business model that investors could buy into. He partnered with an engineer from Zimbabwe and others to grow a viable supply chain and market his products. He also has a strong connection to research and analysis that helps to keep him on the cutting edge of his field. Looking forward into the future, all young entrepreneurs must be able to effectively navigate the digital space.-Entrepreneurship development remains a key policy priority for the government and UN in Ghana and various development partners are working to support the development of a vibrant ecosystem for entrepreneurship.  Key support programs for young agripreneurs are available through the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ghana Enterprises Agency, Ghana Investment Promotion Centre as well as the National Youth Authority. -As we look to a world beyond COVID-19, UNDP Ghana is investing in facilitating entrepreneurship and SME development as a pathway to a greener, inclusive and resilient recovery.  We invite entrepreneurs, enablers and investors to engage with us in promoting integrated solutions to strengthen the ecosystems support to young entrepreneurs in Ghana.",['Icon of SDG 08'],"Angela Lusigi,Ghana,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Sustainable development,Blog post,English"

While this is an improvement from the 2013 figures of about 610 million, there is the fear that COVID-19 impacts will slow down progress and reverse the gains made so far. Ghana, with about 85% electricity access, is ranked one of the highest in sub- Saharan Africa. But, about 5 million people do not have access to electricity, majority of whom live in rural areas.  These 5 million people do not only lack access to energy, but all the opportunities that access to energy brings to societies and households: inclusive and resilient economic growth, environmental sustainability and social development.-In furtherance to the objective of the SDG7 on clean and affordable energy, the United Nations will convene a high-level dialogue in  mid-September  2021 to  raise ambition and accelerate action towards the achievement of the SDG7 targets by catalysing innovative solutions, investments and multi-stakeholder partnerships in support of the  United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy for All (2014–2024).-In line with the SDGs agenda, the 2018-2021 Strategic Plan of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) considers access to clean energy as a critical enabler for sustainable development, whether it be for nutrition, transport, education or economic opportunity, among others. As noted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in their World Energy Investment 2021 Special report, accelerating clean energy transitions  and access in emerging economies can no longer be just one investment option among many - it has to  be a major priority for governments and investors across the globe.-The three strategic opportunities below can be tapped into to facilitate this energy transition:-I. Explore climate finance opportunities, such as the cooperative market approaches offered by Article 6 of the Paris Agreement-Article 6.2 is a market instrument which allows two or more countries to cooperate to invest in programmes to generate mitigation and sustainable development outcomes for the mutual benefits of achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions.  Article 6.2 is set to be a catalyst and a tool to mobilize green/climate finance at scale to implement clean energy solutions in developing and emerging countries.  The 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow this year is expected to among other things negotiate the implementation modality (rule book) of the internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMO- 6.2) and other market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. Ghana is first in Africa and second globally to conclude a bilateral cooperation agreement under article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. This was made possible by the support of  UNDP, in partnership with the EU and Germany Government under the Nationally Determined Contributions Support Programme.  UNDP is moving a step further to support government to develop article 6  strategy to resolve policy issues around Ghana’s engagement in this market approach. -II. Step up efforts to de-risk private investment in clean energy solutions-There is an increasing recognition that while private sector business models and renewable energy technologies are now at an advanced maturity stage, it is clear that public sector policy and financial de-risking for both the supply and demand side are still essential to close the viability gap for renewable energy services  in many emerging economies, including Ghana. The Executive Director of the  International Energy Agency, Mr. Fatih Birol, is quoted to have said “there is no shortage of money worldwide, but it is not finding its way to where it is most needed”- in developing and emerging economies. He noted that, governments need to give international public finance institutions a strong strategic mandate to finance clean energy transitions in the developing world. I agree with this assertion and will further say governments must be quick in responding to the needs of the private sector investors by removing bottlenecks and putting in smart policy, de-risking measures to crowd in private sector investment in the renewable energy sector. The de-risking measures should include targeted public interventions which either reduce, transfer or compensate for risk after completion of  thorough and systematic analysis of the barriers and corresponding risks which hold back private sector  participation  in clean energy transition especially in emerging economies. UNDP is a strategic partner in this respect as it has successfully applied de-risking instruments in several countries in Africa and Asia. De-risking Renewable Energy Investment (DREI) introduces an innovative, quantitative framework to assist policymakers in developing countries to cost-effectively promote and scale-up private sector investment in renewable energy.- IIII. Empower  young local  entrepreneurs and Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises to drive the transition-Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs)  account for 45% of employment in most emerging and developing economies-They depend heavily on bank loans and credit with little access to the capital market. In addition to financing challenges, their operation costs have increased over the years due to rising energy cost and poor energy efficient energy management practices, thus contributing to Ghana’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, a recent survey by the Environmental Protection Agency in Ghana shows that boiler operations by MSMEs in Ghana’s food and beverage industry alone generates 4.1MtCO2e annually of GHG, representing 10% of Ghana’s industrial sector total GHG emissions. Public funding and grants can be best leveraged to support these enterprises to transition to clean energy and to address the funding gaps to make them more competitive and help attract private investments. UNDP, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, has initiated a Performance Based Payment (PBP) mechanism to address this challenge. More partnerships are needed to upscale these initiatives in other sectors. UNDP’s Carbon Payment for Development (CP4D) Facility is designed to operate a PBP scheme and pay companies for climate mitigation outcomes (MOs). This will also contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and offer catalytic funding for small-medium sized enterprises to adopt energy efficiency measures among others. As MSMEs recover from COVID-19,  this is the opportune time to mainstream green and clean energy technologies in the recovery process.-In conclusion, I echo the words of UNDP Administrator, Mr. Achim Steiner, that governments now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make bold decisions that will secure a just energy transition – towards that greener, more sustainable future. The United Nations Development Programme in Ghana  is ready to deepen its partnerships with governments, private sector, and foundations  to provide the needed support to transition businesses and communities to clean energy solutions in Ghana.","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 13  Climate action,Ghana,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Blog post,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,English"

-After the initial exploration phase, which focused on the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in the vaccination campaigns, a decision was made to explore the perspectives of citizens receiving the information. The method used to explore citizens’ views was Design Thinking. The questionnaire developed by the Lab had a total of eight questions, all translated in Criolo (the main local language of Guinea-Bissau). The questionnaire was crafted in a  conversational manner and presented to citizens in the form of a djumbai1 to allow them to be at ease and speak openly about their experiences with COVID-19.  -With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to affect the way we view and conduct our daily interactions; Guinea-Bissau has not been unmarred to its effects. In Guinea-Bissau, the first two cases of COVID-19 were reported on March 24, 2020, in Safim, at the Health Regions of Biombo and Cuntum Madina, which is part of the Health Region of the Autonomous Sector of Bissau (SAB). The first donation of vaccinations was received in the country in  March 2021 via a partnership between South Africa and the African Union, and the institutions responsible for administering the vaccines began sensitization campaigns in earnest.  Between April and December 2021, there were four vaccination campaigns, starting in Bissau and later spreading across the country. With vaccines being the safe and effective way to prevent the disease and save lives, the campaigns catapulted into the priority list of decision makers with the objective to vaccinate 70% of the eligible population2 in the country.-Below are the statistics of the national weekly newsletter epidemiological results extracted from issue 66. -Tested-Positive-Recovered-Active-Deaths-Hospitalized-107.685-+799-6.444-+9-6.277-+9-12-+4-149(6)-+1-423-+1-With the support of the UNDP Accelerator Lab and in collaboration with the UNDP Health Social Protection Cluster, an analysis of the vaccination campaigns carried out in the country was conducted to understand the following:-Exploring the above factors permitted an understanding of how future campaigns can be improved at institutional and local levels. Additionally, for this analysis, the Lab utilized methodologies such as Collective Intelligence and Design Thinking to induce co-creation and sustainability of future vaccination campaigns that take on board the views of the citizens as a port of call.  -When the Lab set out to explore the perspective of the citizens, we were aware that Bissau would not be representative of the country as whole, especially due to the declining basic social infrastructure countrywide. It was therefore imperative that we explored the other regions to understand how COVID-19 had impacted citizens across the country. The key statistics of the exploration phase are depicted below:-From the interviews carried out, there were reoccurring patterns of information that were raised by citizens regarding COVID-19 and the vaccine. Ultimately, the Lab wanted to understand why the people who took the vaccine took it, but more importantly, why those who did take it, didn’t. Identifying why citizens did not take the vaccine would allow the Lab to understand the ways in which campaigns could be adapted to increase the number of overall vaccinated citizens. Some of the most pertinent reoccurring themes are depicted in the diagram below:  -
-From the main themes raised through the synthesis the Lab conducted, below are the main areas of focus, with the most relevant quotes raised by citizens in the regions we visited highlighted.  
-Concern with Other Diseases
-The first few questions in the questionnaire focused on understanding if citizens had any concerns with theirs or their family’s health as an important entry point for storytelling in Design Thinking. From the initial questions, it was clear that more than half of those interviewed had concerns with their own health and that of their families.  
-“I always feel worried about my health, nobody can tell me what I have, it is always malaria, and they give me Coartem”.-“COVID is important, but we have high cases of HIV and Malaria, more people are dying of those diseases, why are we forgetting them in favor of COVID-19?”-“There are other diseases that I think should be paid more attention to, it isn’t only COVID. Here in Guinea-Bissau, there are so many instances of TIFOIDE and there aren’t any medicines to fight this disease” -There is a common notion, countrywide, that COVID has taken over the health system, a health system that is already considered weak and unable to respond to the basic needs of the population. With the pandemic taking away the focus of the health workers, citizens feel worried that not enough is being done to make sure that other diseases in the country are monitored.  - -Diaspora Influence-The exploration revealed that outside of Bissau, citizens relied heavily on their families and friends in the diaspora to be informed on the development of the disease and the vaccines. Many citizens explained that their families abroad convinced them to take the vaccine and they felt they had enough trust to follow their advice. On the other hand, many did not take the vaccine as their family told them the vaccines being donated to Guinea-Bissau were untrustworthy.  -“I didn’t want to take the vaccine, but my grandma in Brazil told me it was safe to take.”-“My friend abroad told me on Facebook he got the disease and was in quarantine, I was afraid of getting it [COVID], so I took the vaccine.”-“My family in Senegal told me to refuse the vaccine.”-The reoccurrence of the diaspora thematic was raised throughout the exploration stage, giving the Lab insight into the influence the diaspora has in the country, especially in more rural areas where there is a bigger flow of informal information taking place.  - -Unilateral Communication -One of the questions on the questionnaire focused on how the interviewees came to know about the disease, or where to go for information. In Bissau, most citizens got information through television, radio, or social media; outside the capital, citizens got their information from the radio, ambulant health professionals or through djumbais in their communities. -“I heard about the disease on radio and TV that people are dying of COVID, that’s why I took the vaccine.”-“I trust in the information provided by the radio, as they even have health workers on to talk about the disease.”-“I only hear about the disease outside when people are in their djumbais.”-“I always hear about this disease, but I don’t know who to ask questions.”-The results in this section demonstrated a huge gap between those in Bissau in comparison to those in regions. Most citizens in the regions, were exposed to information unilaterally, either over the radio or by ambulant health workers, which meant that they were not able to raise questions and get answers about COVID-19 as well as the vaccine. This directly led to citizens not being able to trust the disease and subsequently become more susceptible to believing rumours regarding COVID-19.-Rumours 
-There was a significant number of citizens who due to lack of information, and especially those who live outside the capital, relied heavily on unilateral forms of communication (as discussed in the previous section), which raised doubts they were unable to cast aside. There was an evident correlation between unanswered doubts and the belief in rumours across all the regions.  
-“They have told me that if I take the vaccine within a year, I will die.”
-“There were so many rumours claiming that the vaccine was created to diminish the African population, that’s why I could not take it.”
-“The first time I heard about the vaccine, I didn’t want to take it because they said anyone who took it would die.”
-“In our village we heard many people took it and fell ill, so we will not take it.” 
-The quotes above were all from the regions where there is little access to basic necessities such as running water and electricity. Many of the interviewees found solace in community djumbais where they got information in an informal manner from members of their village. Djumbais are a great tool of information sharing in Guinea-Bissau, however, in the case of the COVID-19 it worked as a disadvantage, because the majority of those who were interviewed, and that did not take the vaccine claimed it was due to rumours they heard informally, often in djumbais. 
- -Understanding of the disease & side effects 
-One of the questions in the questionnaire explored how citizens came to find out about the disease and the vaccine. It became apparent that many citizens did not understand what the disease was about and how it was spread. Not understanding the disease arose from the same bottleneck of unilateral communication from radios and ambulant health workers, who either did not come back or had short timeframe to be in the regions they visited. Additionally, interviewees felt like they did not understand how the vaccine would protect them against the disease and why there were side effects.  -“I don’t know where to go if I have questions.”-“I have tried to get answers to my questions, but last time I went to the centre, nobody was there.” 
-Similar to the point raised on unilateral information sharing, it is evident that the citizens felt like they learnt about the disease but did not get a chance to ask questions or understand where it came from or how it could be treated/cured. Later, the introduction of the vaccine made matters worse because citizens felt like they were not a part of the process to understand the disease and how vaccinating would immunize them against the disease.  - -Taking vaccine under duress-The most significant reoccurring theme during the synthesis landed on citizens taking the vaccine against their will. At first, citizens were encouraged to take the vaccine for their protection and to prevent the wider spread of COVID-19 in the country3. Later, it became clear that the government wanted citizens to take the vaccine and began to impose barriers to key societal infrastructure such as schools4, so that citizens would have no choice but to vaccinate to get access. Whilst conducting the interviews, it became clear that more than half of the interviewees had got the vaccine to either: work, travel, go to school or go to the hospital, which reflected on how little they knew about the disease and its consequences but more so their need to resume normal life.-“I was forced to take the vaccine, otherwise I could not go back to school.”-“I took the vaccine because they did not allow me to travel.” 
-“I cannot be by forced to take the vaccine, I have my own autonomy, why can’t I go to work without the vaccine?”
-“My wife was not allowed to go to work without the vaccine card, but she had refused to take it beforehand.”-Their taking the vaccine due to the need to continue to interact with key societal infrastructures was a powerful tool used to increase the number of vaccinated citizens in the country, especially those with more scepticism. However, it had a direct impact on how much the state and stakeholders are investing in disseminating information to support the citizen's understanding of the disease and the need for the vaccine, as opposed to just taking the vaccine without the deeper comprehension.-Exploring the perception of the citizens was conducive for this exploration stage because the objective is to increase the number of citizens being vaccinated, the only way campaigns can be delivered successfully is to address the issues by looking at how the user, as the subject, is receiving the information. The synthesis demonstrated several areas of focus which were directly contributing to the constraints translating to the low numbers of vaccinated citizens in the regions. Conversely, without this information, it would be futile to continue to dole out time and resources without understanding the barriers at hand.
-The key findings from the exploration of the users’ perspective demonstrated that stakeholders need to be more mindful when developing vaccination campaigns to make sure that not only is the information being disseminated consistent, but also clear. Leveraging the expertise and knowledge of all the stakeholders involved in the campaigns should aid the development of campaigns that take into consideration the context of Guinea-Bissau. The inability  of stakeholders to use collective intelligence to achieve their shared goal of vaccinating 70% of the eligible population is the most detrimental bottleneck the Lab identified in this cycle.  -The main objective of this second stage of exploration was to understand the perspective of citizens regarding the vaccination campaigns carried out in the country. At first glance, the main insights and opportunities raised from this exploration led to the following recommendations, which should be taken into consideration by the key stakeholders.
-Campaigns should take into consideration the influence of the diaspora on the decision-making of Bissau-Guinean citizens. The exploration demonstrated a clear correlation between those who were vaccinated and those that did not, and what influenced them to do so. When outlining strategies to increase numbers of vaccinated citizens, stakeholders should collaborate with the diaspora to transmit a positive message to those within Bissau, as they seek information from the diasporic communities.  -i) what is the disease-vi) what is the vaccine-ii) how it affects humans-vii) where to get the vaccine-iii) where/how to get tested-viii) how the vaccine works-iv) how it is transmitted-ix) what are the side effects-v) how to diminish transmission-x) Why the vaccine is necessary-Campaigns and information disseminated during campaigns should be developed in all major local languages to ensure that even those in the hardest to reach locations are not left behind.  -The circulation of rumours is negatively impacting the number of citizens being vaccinated as citizens find that when they do not have answers, they are more susceptible to believe and engage in conversations which directly contribute to the spreading of rumours. Stakeholders should use this opportunity to hold frequent djumbais where information is shared, and rumours are debunked through Q&As in communities. Additionally, such djumbais will tackle the issue raised surrounding unilateral communication.-
Stakeholders should collaborate with religious institutions who hold influence in communities and are considered as reliable sources, to transmit information regarding the disease and the vaccine to those communities. 
To address the issue of unilateral communication, this can be conducted through a COVID-19 champion system, who will be tasked with sharing reliable information trickled down from key stakeholders.  


-To address citizens feeling under pressure to take the vaccine, stakeholders should consider creating an incentive system, as opposed to creating barriers to access of basic social infrastructure which has led to the production of fraudulent vaccination cards amongst other illicit conduct.-The next step in this cycle is to test the hypothesis of an incentive system to achieve the national target of vaccinating 70% of the Bissau-Guinean population. The subsequent blog of this series will focus on testing of an incentivization system, as well as tackling unilateral forms of communication via recruitment of COVID-19 champions.- -References-1 Djumbai - A term frequently used by Bissau-Guineans referring to an informal gathering of people to discuss any thematic.-2 Anyone over the age of 18 -3 DW.

Read more about the process in our previous blog HERE. -In this learning cycle, we set out to explore how co-creation, participatory design and Design Thinking could be used as tools to create processes that improve public service delivery. As an outcome of framing the challenge, we wanted to learn about the impact of the physical space (the Notary Office) on staff and users.-The Notary Office was chosen as a focus area, as it is the busiest service provider at the Ministry of Justice of Bissau. In total, the Lab interviewed 255 users and 40 staff.  Simultaneously, the Lab carried out a Collective Intelligence workshop, gathering staff, users, the High Commission for COVID-19, UNICEF, and the student association of Lusófona University among others, creating mutual understanding about the challenges faced as well as what caused them.  The main challenge was identified as: inadequate physical space and the barriers it caused to meeting the needs of the users and staff. Some of the additional challenges presented were:

 


60 percent of the interview respondents did not consider the space adequate for its use

90 percent of the interview respondents felt there were no measures in place to protect against the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases.  

Significant pressure from users, with staff increasingly alienating them for lack of understanding and at times, users would even verbally and physically abuse staff. 

Low security in place, making staff fear for their personal safety.



 


Solutions were co-created to address the limitation implying the re-modeling and re-organization of the space as necessary.  The space was remodeled using participatory design, prototyping and iteration, considering the needs and ideas of users and employees. The result was a space organized in a more efficient manner with benches including nudging messages about social distancing and glass protection separating staff and users. The Ministry hired two guards to control the flow and number of people in the space as well as to provide protection to the staff when needed. Additionally, a screen and queue number machine were re-installed properly, and training was provided to the staff on its usage.

Our two hypotheses for this learning cycle were:- - H1: IF... participatory approach is used to tackle the challenges faced in the Notary, THEN... staff and users will feel a stronger sense of belonging, ultimately improving the maintenance of the space.   -H2: IF... The space of the Notary is re-designed through a participatory process, THEN... the needs of users and staff will be better met and improve the perception of how the Notary service is delivered to the population- -A couple of weeks after the intervention, the Lab went back to the Notary, interviewing staff and users to measure the impact of the remodelation and test our hypotheses with a focus on psychological, and sociological change.  To evaluate our hypothesis, we used diverse methodologies including social experiment with users and staff of the Notary through a pre-post survey.-Main finding: Improved access to efficient service delivery


-Main finding: Improved access to efficient service delivery

-One of the main findings was that the user and staff perception of an effective service delivery increased significantly after remodelation . Users felt that they could get what they came for faster and delivered to them in a better way and staff felt that they could do their job in a more efficient way. Our second hypothesis “IF... The space of the Notary is re-designed through a participatory process, THEN... users and staff needs will be better met and improve the perception of how the Notary service is delivered to the population,” was proven through the results of the pre-post survey. 
-Functionality and perception of the importance of the Notary as a public service 

-Functionality and perception of the importance of the Notary as a public service 
-Users also felt that the arrangement and functionality improved after introducing new benches with social distancing messages, a clear queue system, and a cap  on the number of people allowed inside the room at the same time. Additionally, the perception of the Notary as an important public service also improved with the changes made to the space. Similar findings were made through the staff survey. 
-After the remodelation and the changes made, the Lab also measured a positive change in psychological and sociological aspects such as cleanliness, comfort, and perceived security in the space.  Similar findings were made through the staff survey. 
-Users felt that better measures were taken to protect against covid-19 and other diseases after the remodelation, showing the importance of investing in basic items such as alcohol gel at the entrance, a glass protecting screen between users and staff along with social distancing messages on walls, floors, and seats.  Similar findings were made through the staff survey.
-After the remodelation, users reported that maintenance of the space had improved. Similar findings were made for the staff who in addition, also felt that collaboration between staff and users regarding maintenance of the space improved after the participatory processes. The results of the pre-post survey proved our first hypothesis: ""IF... participatory approach is used to tackle the challenges faced in the Notary... THEN staff and users will feel a stronger sense of belonging, ultimately altering maintenance."" At the same time, the hypothesis was disapproved through our observations of the space a couple of months after its inauguration where we found the ticket machine out of use and some destroyed benches (possibly due to poor quality).
- -In terms of inclusiveness and accessibility for users and staff with disabilities, it is a clear area in need of improvement mainly because inclusiveness fell outside the focus of the remodelation, as PWDs (Person With Disabilities) were not part of the participatory process. Today the space is better organized but still lacks a ramp to access the entrance of the Notary resulting in a non-inclusive space.  - -Through this learning cycle, the Lab generated a few major insights and areas of improvement which could benefit similar interventions in the future: - -1. Inclusive designs: To make the public service more inclusive and user-friendly, the design of the space should be prepared and tested from the perspective of the users. In our process, unfortunately there was a lack of participation from PWDs reflecting flaws in the final design. For future processes it is recommended that representatives from diverse groups of PWDs are included in the design process to make the space more inclusive. - -2. Public Participation: Users and the student association from the nearby university were included in the process through collective intelligence sessions during the design and implementation phase. However, after handing over the Notary to the Ministry of Justice, there has been no regular feedback from these groups. As part of our process, we placed a physical feedback box to collect user views and measured many contributions stating a need for a feedback system. Additionally, by observing the space it is noted that lack of maintenance is still a challenge. Therefore, we believe that the continuity and facilitation of public engagement from users is crucial to ensure that the infrastructure is inclusive, properly utilized and maintained to fit the needs of the users. - -3. Engagement from the Ministry: The Ministry was engaged throughout the full process and took different initiatives such as repainting the new space and hiring two guards after learning about the challenges in relation to security and the spread of diseases. Additionally, other surrounding services such as the Building and Automobile Record’s Office, also took inspiration from the process at the Notary Office and used a similar approach to space arrangement.  The engagement of the Ministry is crucial to ensure maintenance and sustainability.  - -4. Digitalization: This learning cycle focused on the physical space and did not give room to explore many things that came up during the exploration phase. For example, another challenge that was raised during the Collective Intelligence workshop was the need for digitalization as all processes in the Ministry of Justice currently are carried out manually creating slow and inefficient processes without transparency.  Our next learning cycle focuses on the digitalization of services in the Ministry of Justice.- -5. Transparency: Another discussion raised from the Collective Intelligence workshops was transparency. Inefficient processes, corruption and lack of transparency are some of the effects enabled by manual processes. From the user point of view, there is a strong need for transparency in public service delivery, i.e. put price lists on the walls and make information available to the users through creating a webpage etc.  - -6. Maintenance: The results showed that both staff and users perceived that the maintenance of the space had improved after the remodelation. On the other hand, when the Lab went back to observe the space a few months later, it was clear that maintenance is still an area that can be improved as for example benches, queue barriers, social distancing messages were not in a functional state anymore.  - -7. Customer service: One of the main findings of this learning cycle was that the user and staff perception of an effective service delivery increased significantly after remodelation. On the other hand, it is still clear that customer service is an area in need of improvement and that there seems to be that the perception of staff  that they are doing the users a favor instead of providing them with a service of quality. For the future, the Lab plans to explore how we can draw learnings from other service sectors such as for example, hotel and restaurants to improve customer service delivery. - -The Lab plans to share the insights among other ministries, advocating for inclusive constructions and remodelations and how they ultimately have the possibility to improve access to public service delivery.  - ",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Africa,Blog post,Behavioral Insights,Guinea-Bissau,Isa Bergh Lopes da Costa,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,English,Accelerator Labs"

The findings are currently being used to inform the process and design of a new House of Justice in Buba.  -One of the main findings of the study was that those who use the HoJ in Gabu, lived in close proximity (no further than seven km distance away from the building). In collaboration with the UNDP Governance Cluster, the Lab set out on a journey to learn about the possibilities of using a mobile unit (Mobile Justice) to decentralize public service provision and bring it closer to the most isolated communities.

This model will be replicated  across the country. The model HoJ aims to facilitate access of citizens to all services related to justice in one single house and strengthen the presence of State institutions in the regions. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Guinea-Bissau Office supported the development of the prototype for the HoJ to be constructed in districts throughout the country, starting with the construction of the HoJ in Gabu which was completed in 2019. Three years after the completion of the Gabu HoJ, we are wondering how the building has impacted staff and users? And what learnings we can draw from the Gabu experience, before the next House of Justice is built in the region of Buba? 
-Based on the findings, it is recommended that a HoJ be constructed in Buba, Quinara as planned, accompanied by a mobile unit to reach wider audiences in the hinterland. The construction of a new HoJ should take into consideration a number of actionable recommendations identified:-Physical attributes-In relation to the physical aspects of the building, many respondents recommended a public toilet, more greenery, shadow, and seating spaces for visitors. Public toilets and water were  included in the design of the Gabu HoJ, but due to poor maintenance or oversight, they are no longer  being used. The improvement of ventilation in the building was also mentioned and the inclusion of   signage to facilitate navigation inside the building, in relation to the different services provided. To maintain the building, future users, local community along with the local governments should be included early in the design process to strengthen the sense of belonging. Furthermore, as the building is public, it should be marked similarly to other public buildings, with flags or common markings of the country’s administrative offices.  -Gender-Access to justice services for female users is low, only 33% of the users in HoJ were female, it is recommended to carry out an exploration to understand why this is the case.  -Collaborations-The question of collaboration between different departments in the HoJ was raised. The staff interviewed at the HoJ in Gabu explained that the lack of maintenance of water and electricity was because they were not delegated tasks, departments would therefore not take ownership of the functions. There is a need to establish a management committee to ensure maintenance and sustainability of the building. A management committee should be made up of members of each of the services provided in the HoJ. For sustainability, the initiative should emanate from the staff, to organize  and manage the structure. Additionally, it is recommended that MoJ appoint a coordinator.-Inclusive design and participatory processes 
-To make a building more inclusive and user-friendly, the design of the building should be prepared and tested from the perspective of future users (especially exposed groups) from its inception. This can be done by inviting the community to give feedback on the plans atvarious stages to ensure that their needs are reflected in the final design. It is important to reflect different user groups eg. children, women, and handicap associations. For instance, to  make the existing HoJ accessible to wheelchair users, the entrance and exit are to be improved. The findings also proposed that there is a lack of interaction among users and staff, as there is no platform for user feedback, and among the local community, government and international institutions as the design process was not participatory. Since the importance of participatory processes is still beyond the public discourse, it is necessary to develop guidelines and platforms for collaboration among development partners, local governments, and the local community, in line with national strategies and global agendas.-Psychological effects-In general, the perception of the building is that it is aesthetically pleasing, users feel “pride” and view the building as a landmark structure of the city. The lack of waiting rooms and seating areas is among a few of the problems identified by users, which contribute to the lack of functionality and comfort of the building. Additionally, several users found the building intimidating, as it exudes authority and requires users to respect or present themselves in a formal manner.  -Services-Overall, users found that the speed at which the services are provided is slow and needs improvement. Additionally, staff do not seem to respect time and punctuality, as they often arrive late for work. This is a general problem in service provision in the country, and not exclusively linked to the HoJ. Among the recommendations, users envisage an immense potential for the digitization of processes. As human resources do not currently exist in HoJ, it is recommended to explore ways in which HR can be decentralized to also support the regions.  -Geographical Location of HoJ-As one of the findings demonstrated that those who use the HoJ live within proximity, it is imperative to have a Mobile Unit to make the services available to those who live furthest from the HoJ in the case of Buba.  - ",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Africa,Blog post,Behavioral Insights,Guinea-Bissau,Isa Bergh Lopes da Costa,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,English,Accelerator Labs"

Through the evaluation and progress form, the winners explained that the “advertising aspect should have gone beyond radios and social media in order to increase the reach,” also with the literacy of citizens between the ages of 15-24 in the country being 60.4%1, “the sign-up should have gone beyond a Google Form, perhaps a manual sign up should have also been available”. The winners also explained that a partnership between the UNDP Accelerator Lab and local financial institutions or bodies would have improved the integration of their businesses and the potential for scaling up.  -The Accelerator Lab considers it an exploration of the entrepreneurship ecosystem, with the experimentation being the impact of the monetary prize and mentorship on the development of micro-enterprises. The results demonstrate that the ecosystem is being built, but there are bottlenecks keeping entrepreneurs in Guinea-Bissau from being resilient and growing their businesses. The main learnings from this exercise are as follows:-1. There is the beginning of an entrepreneurial ecosystem being built in Guinea-Bissau, although it is weak and inflexible.-2. In Guinea-Bissau, the informal sector is the main source of income for most, with only 401 firms formally registered countrywide2, which demonstrates there is a lack of support or encouragement for quasi-entrepreneurs to formalize their business.-3.  There are numerous bodies and institutions which aim to support entrepreneurs. However, the fees imposed by the Government (89,312 XOF for formalizing) make it unrealistic for the formalization of businesses considering the average salary per month in the country is 59,000 XOF3.
(appx. 98 USD). Additionally, complicated legal processes and procedures as well as lack of digitalization make it harder to formalize a business4.-4.  There are many initiatives and incubators to support entrepreneurship in the country, but there is a lack of harmonization, consistency, and longevity of such to sustain entrepreneurship in the country.  -References-1.

-Several solutions were proposed by stakeholders, which will be analyzed and implemented in the next campaign phase starting in the ensuing weeks , to tackle areas covering: 
-Consistency in information being disseminated,-Citizens' concerns regarding information dissemination,-Conduct thorough reviews of campaigns before beginning the next ones.-The next stage of this cycle is to explore the perception of the citizens in Guinea-Bissau, on why they are not getting vaccinated at higher rates? Are the same bottlenecks encountered by the stakeholders having a ripple effect on citizens engagement with each campaign? - -Experiment 1:-Work in collaboration with UNICEF (who has taken over the vaccination campaigns), to develop a campaign that addresses the key stakeholders' concerns: -Timely communication before vaccine expiration, -Consistent information so citizens can build trust,-Use this campaign to collect data from users to understand why they are or are not getting vaccinated.-Experiment 2:-During the exploration phase, the challenge of waste management of vaccination campaigns was brought up. The Lab will test how to improve the disposal of the vaccine waste using the two incinerators, one owned by SIVE and the other by UNDP. It became clear during the exploration that the key role of UNDP throughout the campaigns was to be responsible for the disposal of waste. However, due to bottlenecks, there was room for improving the way the incinerators are used, the Accelerator Lab, therefore, designed a test that will allow the incinerators to be used more effectively which will be shared in the next blog of this series. -References-1 https://news.un.org/pt/story/2021/04/1747702

For governments to remain credible to their citizens, they must treat the design quality of their services as seriously as the best businesses.” – Tim Brown, CEO and president, IDEO
- -And so, in June 2021, the UNDP Guinea Bissau Accelerator Lab embarked on a journey with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the High Commission for COVID-19, to explore how Design Thinking can be used as a tool to improve public service delivery. The Notary Office was chosen as a focus area, as it is the busiest service provider for the Ministry of Justice of Bissau.- -Design Thinking is a design methodology that provides an innovative approach to problem solving and is characterized by focusing on solutions rather than the problems. The methodology has proven to be   useful in tackling complex problems that are difficult to define by themselves. Problems are re-framed in a human- centered approach by engaging with the people closest to the problem, using brainstorming sessions, iterations, prototyping and testing of possible solutions, to confront the challenges at hand.  -There are several reasons why Design Thinking is becoming a valuable methodology for governments. In fact, in recent times,  we are seeing an increase in the number of governments building design capabilities in their organizations when for years it has been more commonplace for the private sector to do so. -In different parts of the world, the trend is showing a decline in citizens' trust in governments. Citizens feel that their needs and who they are, is not taken into consideration by the governments.  -“Design thinking is a human-centered approach, meaning that it starts with people’s needs (and considers both citizens and civil servants). The nature of this approach puts people back in balance with what they are doing at a time when both citizens and civil servants feel they are being led by processes and regulation, rather than enabled by them “.[1]  -Innovation is slowly being put on the agenda as the way governments deliver services is becoming more and more important and cost saving processes are no longer enough. -Significant changes in service delivery and policy design have been made possible using innovative methods such as Design Thinking.   -The service experience for users is often incoherent as the gap between those who deliver services and those who make policies is often big. An approach led by design thinking can decrease this space and some governments are already experimenting in this area. -“Irrespective of where a government is in the world and their local challenges, there is one common issue: a shift from ‘designing from the inside out’ to ‘designing from the outside in’. Governments drive the change they want to see and tend to focus on delivering in a way that is most efficient for them. As a result, the desired change often misses the mark with citizens. Using design approaches puts in balance the desired changes of a government with the desires of the citizens. It is ultimately about creating tangible and positive impact“. [2]- - -The UNDP Accelerator Lab Guinea-Bissau used a Design Thinking process, interviewing 255 users and 40 staff.  Out of the respondents, 60 percent did not consider the space adequate for its use and 90 percent felt there were no measures in place to protect the spread of COVID-19.  Working closely with key stakeholders such as the High Commission for COVID-19 and the student association of Lusófona University, a common understanding was reached, and challenges and root causes were identified through a collective intelligence workshop. Once the main limitation was identified as: inadequate physical space and the barriers it caused to meeting the needs of the users and staff, possible solutions were co-created to address the limitation suggesting the re-modeling and re-organization of the space as a must. Additionally, there was significant pressure from users, with staff increasingly alienating them for lack of understanding and at times, even verbally abusing them.  There was no security in place, making staff fear for their personal safety and protecting themselves from violence was often a problem too.  - -Possible solutions were co-created alongside staff, users of the Ministry of Justice, representatives from the High Commission for COVID-19, UNICEF (United Nations Children Fund), the student Association of Lusófona University, among other stakeholders. 
-The space was then remodeled using prototyping and iteration, considering the needs and ideas of users and employees. The space was organized in a more efficient manner, providing glass protection separating staff and users. The Ministry hired two guards to control the flow and number of people in the space as well as for protecting the staff when needed. Additionally, the screen and queue number machine were re-installed properly, and a training was provided to the staff on their usage. 
-The remodeling was carried out through a participatory process using prototyping and iteration promoted by the UNDP Accelerator Lab in partnership with technicians and users of the Ministry of Justice and the Covid-19 High Commission. The new space aims to improve public service delivery to the population, considering an effective service provision with measures in place that mitigates COVID-19. 
-On the 13th of December 2021, the Ministry of Justice and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) inaugurated the remodeled Notary Office, aimed at providing better services to the citizens of Bissau. The inauguration was held in the presence of the German Ambassador and the Director General of the Civil Registry and Notary. The ribbon-cutting event began with a visit to the remodeled space, followed by speeches made by the UNDP Resident Representative, Tjark Egenhoff, and the Minister of Justice, Iaia Djaló.

Human-centered approaches start and end with people’s needs and might have the ability to create a balance where civil servants and citizens are empowered by practices rather than led by them.  As more and more governments over the world embark on the journey of innovation, we might also see more of the use of Human-Centered approaches in public service and policy design in Guinea Bissau in the near future.

 What is the relationship between culture and development? What is the ability of the creative economy in Guinea-Bissau to “invent the new” or “re-invent the existing”, ultimately turning into an economic catalyst?-These were some prodding questions we asked ourselves when the Accelerator Lab Guinea-Bissau embarked on a six weeklong “Bias di Soluson” (solution finding trip), as we call it in the local Creole language. The aim of the trip was to establish contact with existing innovation networks and draw inspiration on how to tackle complex sustainable development challenges by learning from the people who face those challenges every day.-During the past six weeks we toured all regions of the country, met with 45 out of 48 authorities at both regional and sectoral levels, as well as civil society and local communities. We mapped a total of 158 grassroot solutions, innovations, inventions, and positive deviances, which will soon be showcased in the Na No Mon Platform, a community platform initiated by UNDP Guinea-Bissau, with the ambitious aim of making the existing innovation networks in the country visible. Since returning to the office, let's just say there's been a lot to digest, summarize and analyze! It has become clear to us that culture is everywhere. It affects all levels of society and public services and is deeply rooted in our heritage and traditional know-how, thus crossing all artistic inclinations.-Looking back at the past six weeks of criss-crossing the regions and sectors of the country, there is one thing that really stood out in our minds, the Ojon Palm Tree life cycle, and its potential! We had the chance to experience the life cycle of the palm tree up close. Now, let us tell you the story!-The  Ojon Palm Tree-The scientific name of the Ojon Palm Tree is Elaeis Guineensis. The tree is native to Africa but was imported to South-East Asia around 100 years ago as a decorative tree crop. Today, Indonesia and Malaysia make up over 85% of the global supply of palm oil although there are 42 other countries that are also major exporters of the product. In Guinea-Bissau, palm oil used to be an export commodity during the 70 ́s and 80s. Nowadays, it is mostly produced on small scale household level. Globally, palm oil has been, and continues to be a major driver of deforestation of some of the world’s most biodiverse forests, destroying the habitat of already endangered animal species.-The palm tree is tall and narrow and can be found almost everywhere in Guinea-Bissau. The renowned West African palm oil is produced from this tree, but conversations with communities in various parts of the country made us realize that there is a deeper value chain to be found in its yields.- -The traditional Chabéu dish-Food is strongly connected to culture and heritage. We were invited for a traditional meal of Chabéu (dish made from Ojon palm oil), when we visited the sector of Boé, home to the city Madina de Boé, which served as the de facto capital until Guinea-Bissau's independence was finally recognized by the colonial power of Portugal in 1974. Chabéu is one of the most popular dishes of Guinea-Bissau. It is served with white rice and smoked-fish, pumpkin and cassava, a dynamic combination with a specific taste created by the palm oil base.- - -The lady who invited us for the meal walked us through how she harvests the fruits in the nearby forest. She smiled as she explained that the palm fruits are available all year round, in other words “it is always Chabéu season”. After picking the palm fruits she keeps one part for herself and sells the part she does not need, allowing her to create a small economy to sustain her household. The palm oil, or Citi oil as it is called locally, is extracted by boiling the fruit in hot water until it is soft and then squeezing by hand or machine. The knowledge of how to extract, cook and process the fruit, was passed down from her mother, and is a centuries-old tradition in Guinea-Bissau, known to almost every woman living in the rural parts of the country as a cultural relic and an economic treasure. - -Black soap made from kernel oil-In the region of Boé we also had the chance to meet with Fatumata Sedibé who lives in the village of Beli. The village named Beli is located in the hinterland of the isolated mountains in the northeast of the country. There is no phone network coverage in the area and messages are often conveyed through people that travel along the bumpy unpaved roads to neighboring tabankas (villages). Transport of goods and services is extremely limited, hence inhabitants must be creative in solving their everyday challenges. Once again, we were invited for a meal of Chabéu, this time without the fish since, it is hard to transport fresh goods due to the transport issues the villagers face. Fatumata told us the story of how after extracting the Citi oil she uses for cooking, she boils the kernel that is left one more time. This allows for the kernel oil to come out, which she uses to create her own “black soap”. The characteristic dark color of the soap comes from the kernel oil but can also issue from ashes of locally harvested plants. In the case of Fatumata, the ingredients she uses is kernel oil mixed with leftovers from corn peelings she uses for cooking, as well as a portion of caustic soda. She demonstrated to us the different steps of the soap making process. In general, when the soap is completed, she sells it to her neighbors to sustain her household or uses it for her personal hygiene as well as for washing dishes and clothes. - - -This kind of soap is produced in a range of African countries and the “African black soap”, as it is commonly called, is gaining increased popularity in the west as it is said to have many beneficial properties such as anti-inflammatory, exfoliating, anti-acne, eczema treating, reducing dark sports and blemishes among many others.- -Palm wine-In the region of Canchungo, the western part of the country, we visited the isolated island of Jeta. To get there, we travelled 10 hours from the capital, Bissau, on critical road conditions and on a canoe ride through the mangroves. There is only one canoe per day to the island thus we needed to set up good contacts for information about the timetable as takeoff depends on the tide, which changes rapidly.-When we finally reached Jeta, we got a warm welcome from the village chief also known as the Regulo, and we unexpectedly ended up having a discussion with his son regarding the widespread palm wine production on the island, extracted directly from the Ojon palm tree. The wine can be sold locally or transported to the mainland to be sold at the market. It generates employment for the youth who would otherwise have extremely limited options to find work. Nanicio Gomes told us his routine of waking up at five O’clock in the morning to walk into the forest and climb up the palm tree to pierce the top close where the fruits grow. A beautiful funnel made of palm leaves is placed next to the piercing to collect the sap into a recycled plastic bottle that is tied to the tree. When this task is completed, Nanicio climbs down from the tree and goes back home to sleep a few more hours before returning to collect the filled up bottles. After collecting the palm sap, it begins a fermentation process due to the presence of natural yeasts in the wine. Palm wine fermentation yields a tasty wine that is sweet, sour and acidic with around 4% alcoholic content. The longer the fermentation process of the palm wine, the stronger and sourer and/or acidic the taste turns out to be. - - -Construction wood -During our six weeklong Biás di Soluson, we had the honor to speak to different people across the country, and we were often met by warm stories of how everyday challenges are faced. Often, discussions were long, and we were invited into people’s homes to escape from the hot sun to share a meal. Visiting various locally constructed buildings, one element that kept on occurring, was the Cibi wood. Cibi is the local name for the Ojon palm tree wood. The reason for its widespread use is its affordability and availability but also its amazing properties such as structural strength, fire, and termite resistance. The wood is used both in local constructions and in contemporary architecture.- - -In Pecixe, the neighboring island to Jeta, we were invited by a family to stay over in a traditional house as we continued our search for grassroot innovations. Once again, we shared a meal of Chabéu. Whilst discussing different inventions from the island, we also learnt more about the construction of the house we stayed in. The house was built out of clay blocks and had a roof structure made from Cibi wood. In the concrete floor we again encountered the treasure from the Ojon palm tree. Kernel, the left over from extracting palm oil from the fruit was used to mix concrete, since gravel is scarce in the sandy island of Pecixe.- - -Ojon kernel used as coal
-Kernel used as coal was the last stage of the “Ojon palm tree cycle” we experienced on our trip throughout the country, although there are most probably many more innovative ways in which the palm tree is being used in Guinea-Bissau, for example, the roots of the Ojon palm tree, are said to be used in traditional medicine. As we sat down and admired the talent of a blacksmith in the city of Catió who created beautiful agricultural tools, he explained to us about the process of his work and how he uses the Kernel from the Ojon palm tree as coal for his fire. After the palm oil and the kernel oil has been extracted from the Ojon fruit, the kernel is used to create coal, which is sold at the market. The Ojon coal is cheaper and lasts longer than coal made of wood. Use of the Ojon kernel coal can contribute to reducing deforestation in Guinea-Bissau. - - -There is a whole circular economy to be explored from the Ojon palm tree and there seems to be a clear relationship between culture and economic development. As our Lab sets out on our next learning cycle, we have no doubt that the creative economy can have the ability to become an economic catalyst for development in Guinea Bissau.-

Part 1 can be found at this link.-“How do you call online learning real learning? Learning usually happens in the classroom under the direct guidance and supervision of instructors!” This is a rhetorical question we have heard for over a year now.  Restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic have disturbed education systems all around the world. In Iraq specifically, all learning was moved online suddenly. This challenge led to an intervention by the UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq to conduct a mission of sensing, exploring, and experimenting with solutions that support the incorporation of online learning and future-proofing the education system. As an explorer, this tempted me to investigate the question “What is the most efficient and effective approach to enhancing online learning in Iraq amid the pandemic and how do we embed it within the higher education system in Iraq?”-Having an open mind to exploration is the starting point to understand the education system in Iraq and we must combine that openness with a set of innovative methodologies to transform our understanding into future-proof education solutions. The aim is to make sense of the rapidly changing environment, generate learning, and use these insights to support the design and experimentation of new solutions to enhance learning in Iraq. The exploration aims to use a set of innovative tools including: Horizon Scanning, Partnership Building, Systems Thinking, and the generation of collective intelligence to explore how to embed online learning into the education system and drive change. This blog will take us through this exploration journey and the production of knowledge.- -In 2020, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq became absorbed  in an innovative exploration journey using the horizon scanning, and specifically, Mapping Signals of Change approach, to explore events amid the COVID-19 pandemic within the higher education system in Iraq. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq mapped a strong positive signal, online learning, which you can read about in Part 1 of this blog series.-The online learning signal led to a break in the causality loop of learning in Iraq and it added another layer of opportunity to improve the digital skills and increase employability of youth; hence the need to identify strategic opportunities to strengthen the signal. Thorough research and discussions with various stakeholders led to the identification of a strategic opportunity to strengthen online learning, inducing a structural change to the education system in Iraq towards blended learning. Blended Learning is the use of both offline and online methods for teaching and learning; it allows for a planned and deliberate embeddedness of online learning into the education system and tests its applicability alongside offline learning, which ensures adaptability to emerging challenges and the upskilling of the digital capabilities of Iraqi youth.-Next, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq aimed to embed the use of blended learning into the work of different stakeholders to achieve an impact at scale.-To answer this question, the UNDP-AccLab  used stakeholder-mapping to identify the potential partners who have the knowledge, power, authority, resources, and commitment to embed blended learning into Iraq’s higher education system.  The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq started mapping potential stakeholders, including government, corporations and large businesses, civil society organizations, and social innovators and citizens, to identify those who work on higher education in Iraq.  The mapping phase revealed that the Government of Iraq is the stakeholder that has the power and authority to induce long-term and structural changes to the education system in Iraq by introducing policy and regulations. Within the government, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR) is the entity responsible for the design of the teaching curriculum, curriculum implementation and the capacity building of higher education professionals and is already committed to incorporate blended learning and enhancing Iraq’s education system.-The partnership tools enabled us to choose the most impactful partner to drive change and set a formal partnership through starting the “Blended learning Initiative.” This initiative by the UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR) represents a major achievement for the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq, since it enabled the AccLab in Iraq to incorporate the analytical tool, Mapping Signals of Change, into the work of the MoHESR and embed the use of blended learning and innovative methodologies into the work of the Government of Iraq. Adding to that, this initiative represents the first formal cooperation between UNDP-Country Office in Iraq and the MoHESR, hence the AccLab succeeded in forming a groundbreaking partnership.-The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq mapped the higher education system in Iraq to understand synergies and find and analyze potential problems through issue-mapping, the process which utilized online gamified tools, interactive sessions, and performing interviews and working groups. The process of exploring with MoHESR, which occurred in two stages during 2020 and 2021, led to valuable insights.-Stage one of exploration during 2020 enabled us to understand the system through engaging all partners to analyse the interplay between the different issues and identify the critical points for intervention. The interplay highlighted that there is a need to work on several factors to embed blended learning, including the way the curriculum is delivered to students at universities, the tools being used to communicate and evaluate the learning, and the behaviors of universities and teachers towards digital tools. Stage two of exploration during 2021 informed us that changing the foundation that prepares graduate students interested in pursuing a career in academic teaching in the Iraqi Higher education Systemstarts with  the Teaching Method Curriculum taught at the 35 Continuous Learning Centers in Iraqi Universities. Second, system mapping within the Continuous Learning Centers led to mapping of expertise and highlighted that teaching methods expertise are abundant, yet there is a lack of expertise in blended learning design and tools. This gap is mainly due to the traditional methods of teaching that depended on offline learning before the pandemic.  In order to implement the UNDP-AccLab mandate, a committee of 17 Teaching Methods Curriculum professionals was formulated, and the lab hired a blended learning consultant to develop local capacities and support the MoHESR in producing a future-proof local solution, with local expertise.
- -Explorers are the change sensors within UNDP; we merge the signals on the ground with quantifiable evidence to generate collective intelligence and provide new solutions that fit our community’s needs.  In order to collect evidence, one of the largest and widest data collection and analysis processes regarding the current Teaching Methods Curriculum and its implementation was performed by the “Blended Learning Initiative.” The data collection and analysis phase started with collecting and analyzing 19 Teaching Methods Curriculums from different Iraqi universities.  The analysis focused on the current structure of the curriculum, and the degree to which it embeds blended learning. This was further enriched by performing qualitative interviews with nine various stakeholders, ranging from education professionals to students within the Iraqi learning ecosystem. The qualitative interviews allowed us to sense and explore attitudes and perceptions among key stakeholders, specifically about the capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to engage with blended learning. The collaborative efforts led to generating collective intelligence, whichfalls within three areas that will be used to enhance decision-making:-1- The structure and design of the curriculum: Most of the curriculums have some aspects of blended learning.-2- The content of the curriculum: Weaknesses include lack of a blending mechanism to perform evaluations and assessments, lack of a unified Teaching Methods Curriculum across universities, and lack of various specializations in the curriculum.-3- Capacity building needs: The analysis led to an evident lack of blended learning and digital skills amongst different stakeholders. This is affecting the adaptation of the Iraqi higher education system to blended learning.-The use of innovative methodologies led to the Government of Iraq welcoming the UNDP-Accelerator Lab to induce structural change to the higher education system in Iraq. As the representative of MoHESR stated, “The UNDP-AccLab do things differently; they actually tried to understand the status-quo, not in isolation but in collaboration with the different stakeholders, to generate future-proof education solutions that can accelerate the development of Iraq’s education system.” The collective intelligence gathered by the Blended Learning Initiative will inform the design and experimentation of the updated Teaching Methods Curriculum developed by government partners and local experts, leading to a more modern and adaptable higher education system in Iraq.- - ","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Innovation,Safa Fadhil Al-Qoch,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 4  Quality education,In the news,Iraq,Collective Intelligence,Accelerator Labs,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The coronavirus pandemic further tested our adaptability to new circumstances. This adaptability, or behavioral level change, can be magnified to affect the way countries function, economies survive, and humanitarian work is done. The challenges of 2020 affected the development sector and added to the complex issues the world was facing before 2020.-The pandemic and its catastrophic implications provided the perfect ground to test “new ways of doing things,” and specifically to test the newly formed UNDP Accelerator Labs. The UNDP-Accelerator Labs were set up in 2019 in 60 countries around the world, growing to92 countries currently, to inject innovation into the “way of work” in development to better tackle 21st century challenges and find innovative grassroot solutions.  UNDP Iraq established the Accelerator Lab in its Country Office to be part of the world's largest and fastest learning network, accelerate learning and support local innovations to accelerate development. While the AccLab is supposed to conduct testing, in actuality, the pandemic tested the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq, and it specifically examined its effectiveness to accelerate learning to solve complex problems and support grassroot innovations.-The pandemic allowed for the testing of different parameters of the effectiveness of UNDP-AccLab in Iraq within two complex challenges, which are youth unemployment and climate change within the COVID-19 context. The parameters of testing include the capability of the UNDP-AccLab to innovatively map and use a combination of new methodologies, new sources of data, and new partners in order to accelerate development through producing insights and supporting local solutions. Let us see if the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq was able to tick all parameters and accelerate learning to better tackle youth and unemployment and climate change challenges in the context of the global coronavirus pandemic.- - -➢   The type of data is the starting point-The pandemic showed us the need to evolve in our data collection methods and tested our adaptability to acquire new sources of data, since in-person access to data collection was limited. This led us to seek new domains of data that may not have been collected or studied before. Amid the pandemic the virtual field was the main medium for access to the community.  Hence, the UNDP AccLab in Iraq utilized social media data, specifically the power of words and communication patterns, to build a strategy for tapping into insight and mapping local innovations. Gamified methods to collect data were also used to sense and explore Climate Awareness in Iraq through Mission 1.5 Game. On a more innovative frontier, artificial intelligence was used to sense and explore individuals’ mindsets in regard to employment opportunities in Iraq. On a future forwarded approach, the UNDP AccLab in Iraq supported the Gender Responsive Crises Chamber, a semi-official crisis chamber started by UNDP’s Country Office in Iraq aimed at documenting, mapping and analyzing the upward trends of violence in the country that are present now and may affect the future.
-The data acquired required innovative methodologies for analysis, including the need to sense and explore local solutions to tackle complex challenges. Overall, the data collection process proved that Iraqi individuals are aware of the statistical numbers regarding the high unemployment rate and the deteriorating climate situation in Iraq, yet the data did not incentivize action. Additionally, the data collection process demonstrated a lack in the connectivity of the ecosystems, for both the youth unemployment and climate change challenges.-➢   The magic of methodologies
-Accelerating development to tackle complex challenges doesn’t only require us to test new sources of information, but also to combine the data generated with new methods in order to generate learning with the aim of decreasing the “relevance gap”’ between current approaches and 21st century challenges.-In order to understand the system and why data in the system is not leading to action, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq used an innovative  mix of three methodologies: Systems thinking, Future Thinking and Design Thinking. The three methodologies complete each other. Holistically, systems thinking enabled us to understand the wholeness and the interconnectedness of the system to find and analyze its nodes, through the use of issue-mapping. Then came time to analyze the nodes, issues and solutions, through the use of  design thinking, and simultaneously use future thinking to understand the implications of specific problems and solutions in the future. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq used the above innovative methods and explored the innovation system in Iraq and used design thinking to generate innovative solutions. Then, we took our spaceship from the present into the near future where we identified current signals of change, the trends they are building, and how this will impact our future.-The interplay of the data and methods revealed surprising insights. First, it pointed out the reasons behind the lack of connectivity in the system, which is largely due to lack of communication within the ecosystem, and this leads to asynchrony in the ecosystem intervention. Second, it leads us to recognize that most of the work that is being done to tackle complex challenges is not communicated well to all stakeholders in the ecosystem.-➢   The real change agents-Now it is time to adapt and respond to the information produced through our data collection and innovative methodologies. Previously, we highlighted the need to enhance coordination and collaboration in the ecosystem, while now we focus on “bridging” stakeholders, and encouraging ground for interaction with the aim of establishing a cohesive ecosystem.-With the aim of enhancing local engagement in creating policy-level change, the UNDP-AccLab adopted a bottom-up approach that includes two levels, starting from the local community and driving change upward to policy makers. For the first level, the UNDP AccLab in Iraq performed a stakeholders mapping exercise that led to the formation of an innovation network “Community Service Team,” to align efforts within the ecosystem. Then, it was time to move to the second level and systematically map and identify resources and knowledge within the network, in order to inform building partnerships and policy-level change. Mainly, this involved identifying the active actors in the ecosystem, performing mapping of knowledge and skills across the network, and creating long-term partnership with stakeholders. The strategic building of the partnership approach enabled the UNDP AccLab in Iraq to partner  with the Government of Iraq, represented by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, to generate learning and change the “way we do things” on an institutional level. Also, UNDP-AccLab cooperated with one of the largest telecommunication companies in Iraq, Asiacell Company, in order to support grassroot innovations during the pandemic. The UNDP-AccLab was able to successfully collaborate with civil society organizations, specifically The Station for Entrepreneurship, and used a participatory future approach to incentivize action within the local community.   In order to ensure mission continuity , we built partnerships with academic institutions, such as the University of Basrah-College of Agriculture, in order to incorporate our learnings and mechanisms to support local innovations within Iraqi educational institutions.- -The interplay of data, methodology, and bringing new partners and learnings generated from the UNDP-AccLab work in Iraq were inspired by the Global UNDP Accelerator Lab Network and shared with the network to support in accelerating development. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq spoke out loud about its endeavors on social media outlets and published monthly blogs. Additionally, the AccLab benefitted from the larger learning network through participating in organizing the first ever Explorers Global Summit 2020. We also shared products with UNDP through the publication of the Design Thinking Training Manual. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq shared 100 local innovations with the world to support the role of local communities innovations in accelerating development.-We know that humans should learn, adapt, and keep learning. This learning comes in the shape of challenges, resolutions, and results. For the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq, the implications of the coronavirus pandemic helped to test our flexibility and innovation. Despite the challenges of 2020, UNDP-AccLab in Iraq has adapted and is ready to generate continued learning opportunities to support livelihoods in 2021.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Innovation,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Safa Fadhil Al-Qoch,Hasan Al Rubaiey,Noor Al-Kamoosi,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 4  Quality education,In the news,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Iraq,Accelerator Labs,English"

The rivers started the story “We, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, will be abundant with the essence of life, water, and with essential nutrients for the growth of this civilization.” The sun interrupted and suggested another start for the story; “I will be called the “red sun” in the future, I will take over all our days and nights and people won’t be able to enjoy the sweet breezes of March’s spring. The land’s pride, palm trees, will seize to exist and their shade and dates will no longer provide a safe escape from my heat; the fertile land will collapse.” Here, science interrupted the opposing images of the future, and proposed to use discipline to keep things the way they are “we can use my solar power to mitigate the climate change challenges happening now.” Humanity disagrees with all stories and has a spiritual transformative story of the future “I believe in us, we can change, we can unmask ourselves and reveal prosperity and transformation for our land, rivers, palm trees and even the sun.”  -These stories are interpretations of artworks presented by Iraq’s current generation,  depicting their different visions of the future of climate in Iraq. The UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq asked them to consider the current signs and formulate their visions by thinking about their lives, the effect of climate change on them, and the future of their country. The aim is to further sense and explore the question:  “Why isn’t climate action prioritized by the Iraqi community?” This time, from a future perspective. -The First Future of Climate Exhibition in Iraq-As an explorer in the UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq, I went on a journey to innovatively sense and explore how people were reacting to climate change issues, and grasp the weak signals furthering or worsening the issue and the impending consequences resulting from current actions and behaviors in Iraq. The exploration journey, this time was imaginative, required a visual medium to express people’s vision about the future and enhance their learning about the climate in a collective manner. What better way to express this, than through visual art?-For that, the UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq launched, in cooperation with the Station Foundation for Entrepreneurship, The First Future of Climate Exhibition in Iraq. It was an exhibition that asked the Iraqi community to represent their thoughts of the future of climate in their country through artworks. Precisely, showing the alternative images of the future they expect to see in Iraq depicting the climate change challenge as growing, collapsing, transforming, and/or simply remaining as is. The exhibition used a participatory future thinking technique that engaged the public audience through three categories: Fine Art, Children’s Art, and Digital Art. The exhibition included two phases, submissions, and the final exhibition. The online submissions phase took five weeks and was accompanied by promotion using the support of four influencers. The second phase included the physical exhibition, which was held in Baghdad with different climate action supporters in Iraq. The artworks that were submitted from all over Iraq revolve around climate change imagined via a future perspective.- - -What has the imaginative journey from the future taught us?-The use of alternative images of the future has heavily enhanced the sensing and exploring the journey of the UNDP-Accelerator Lab and have led to different imaginings of the future of climate in Iraq. The imaginings, top artworks, can be found in the story: Iraqis sharing their vision for the future of climate in Iraq. The artworks were labeled according to the generic images of the future. The growing category represents 12% of artworks; growing artworks are the ones that foresee a renewing future of climate in Iraq. Another 12% addressed the need to be disciplined in our actions and behaviors and protect our environment. While 16% of images saw a transformation in the climate of Iraq. Most importantly, 60% of the artworks foresee collapsing, a future where climate change is worsening, leading to a drastic increase in heat, desertification, and pollution. The collapsing images held individuals to account, emphasizing how their actions and behaviors are worsening the environment. Hence, as an explorer this allowed the UNDP-Accelerator Lab to see the climate change issue from the perspective of people’s behaviors to find grassroots innovations to tackle this issue. -The alternative images have also led to a realization that climate change accumulates inconspicuously in Iraq, and that small behaviors and actions affect it. Participants expressed that the dominance of other issues in Iraq like instability and economic challenges drive attention away from climate change, which led to a gradual build-up rather than a stark, noticeable effect of climate change. A metaphor that can be used to describe this issue is the boiling frog effect. This metaphor is taken from frogs who don’t feel the gradual increase of temperature until the heat is unbearable and they collapse. Climate change, and especially the human causes of climate change, are usually not recognized until it is too late, and the damage cannot be reversed or will be extremely difficult to reverse.-The sensing and exploring activity led to raising awareness about the climate in Iraq, particularly among children through the  Kids Messages “Art Exhibition”. Adding to that, the exhibition has successfully inspired UTV Channel to broadcast a full episode about climate change in Iraq, which has also led the community to recognize the climate change issue.-One of the most practical insights the exhibition provided for the learning cycle of the UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq is information about the level and type of most useful local solutions for experimentation in Iraq. The alternative images of the future are focused on pushing for more responsible individual and systematic coherent behaviors towards climate change. This insight informs the identification and experimentation of local solutions; according to community priorities, it would be more useful for local solutions to focus on laying the groundwork for promoting and supporting climate solutions that focus on individual behavior. This allowed us to explore the acceptability of local solutions and the feasibility of implementing and sustaining them in the future.  -But wait! Why the imaginative journey in the first place?-The status-quo learning journey of climate change in Iraq completed by the UNDP-Accelerator Lab in the first half of 2020 investigated the individual level, specifically used Mission 1.5 game and Design Thinking, to explore the way of thinking of the Iraqi community about climate. This resulted in invaluable insights regarding the present status of the challenges, and the individual level behavior. These insights informed the characteristics of solutions design that incentivize individuals to direct their attention towards the deteriorating climate in Iraq and their role in changing the status quo. The solutions produced by design thinking were largely focused on the present and did not take into consideration the need to foresee the future to have future-proof solutions. But how to make solutions future-proof?-The fastest and largest learning network in the world, UNDP-Accelerator Labs, embedded future thinking into the work of labs. We took this opportunity to experiment in future thinking in our sensing and exploring journey. Future Thinking allowed us to take a systematic approach to recognize the interconnectedness of the system, not merely focus on direct cause and effect and it resulted in multiple options of what the future might look like. Hence, this systematic approach will enable us to identify and experiment on sustainable local solutions.- - -Conclusion-Immersing a set of alternative images of the future of climate in Iraq enabled us to sense and feel the present and recognize all the current information, signs, weak signals, human behavior, policies, cities structure, and other factors affecting the climate nowadays. Now we know how the future will look if the current actions and behaviors towards the climate continue. Next, UNDP-Accelerator Lab will start working on finding local solutions that will tackle the emergence of the collapsing images of the future, with a particular focus on sustainable solutions that change individuals’ behavior.- ","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Innovation,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Safa Fadhil Al-Qoch,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,In the news,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Iraq,Accelerator Labs,English"

However, women were historically excluded from the entities and institutions tasked with combating financial and administrative corruption. -Despite its societal importance, the role of women was always overlooked. UNDP’s invitation, in the summer of 2020, to discuss this issue made us think deeply about our various roles and trust our abilities and the impact we can have on our society. Since then, I was one of the first women to volunteer to work on this cause with other colleagues. We discussed, on a daily basis, how corruption deprives us and our children of the services we need. Because of corruption, the roads in my city are not paved and I pray that neither I nor my children get ill as there are no good hospitals. And, because of corruption, the son of our neighbors could not find work, decided to emigrate and drowned. His mother is still crying over him.  -Before that day, I had no aspirations. All our dreams collapsed because of corruption and corrupt people who, we believed, had all the power, while we only had frustration and despair. However, today, I can emphatically and clearly say that the hope, power and persistence of Iraqi women will achieve our dream of a better future for us, and our children. -The power of corrupt people is not real. We will surround this phenomenon through our important work and we will encourage society to reject corruption and corrupt people. I decided with a number of women members in the Muthanna Governorate to develop a strategy to raise awareness about the role of women in combating corruption, despite the difficulties and mockery we faced when we started saying that we, the Iraqi women, aspire to a country free of corruption. -Since September 2020, we have been working incessantly and visiting decision-makers. We are pleased to say that Al-Muthanna Governor, professors at Al-Muthanna University and a large number of women offered great encouragement and were impressed with the Iraqi women’s bravery and boldness in fighting corruption. The Muthanna Governor’s Consultant for Civil Society Organizations showed his support and expressed readiness to cooperate with us to engage the local organizations in instilling the forum's ideas and goals during their social events aiming to establish the anti-corruption culture together.-I probably should say that I was keen on volunteering for the Women against Corruption Forum because the women members believe in their roles, and the forum’s principles and goals conformed with my ideas and aspirations in building a country free of corruption. In addition, my work with the forum opened new horizons before me including positive relationships and constructive ideas which serve the society and highlight the role of women in combating corruption. I thank the UNDP for supporting women in all governorates and in all fields. ",[],"In the news,Governance and peacebuilding,Blog post,Anti-corruption"

Do you remember seeing the sky, making shapes and figures out of the clouds and stars, or the cardboard box that you could turn easily into a spaceship or a robot? As you grew up, your imagination started to get in shape of other’s ideas, the box is rationally now just a box. -As humans, we are highly acquisitive creatures, our brains are designed to act and interact according to a set of data (memories, actions, rules, norms, traditions. education, religion, politics, and much more) collected from our surroundings and installed into our brains. These data in fact shape our personality and influence our career paths and opportunities.-The actions and decisions humans take are a result of the surrounding environment the human brain integrates and interacts with. Looking at the issue of the tunnel-vision of employment in Iraq among youth from a bird’s eye, we observed that their brains are saturated with ideas and inputs from the surrounding environment but focusing mainly on the challenges of employment rather than the potential skills development and employment opportunities. Our previous work on tunnel-vision of employment informed that the challenges of youth and unemployment are well defined and already on the table for almost everyone, including the freshly enrolled students in universities, who have already had their brain saturated with these beliefs.-This belief-based mindset is generating social patterns that most Iraqi youth may live within and may leave when a differentiating factor is applied to their life concluding in either enforcing or demotivating their development potentials. These complex challenges require pain-focused solutions. In search of the solutions, The UNDP-Acc Lab in  Iraq conducted different sensing, exploring and experimenting activities using Collective Intelligence, Foresight Framework, Behavioral Insights, Design Thinking Methodology, and Systems Thinking Methodology, resulting in mapping more than 100 local solutions. -Now, we need to figure out what type of these 100 local solutions can work best for these saturated brains to tackle the mentioned challenges.-Simulating the reality of youth and unemployment in Iraq-As a solutions mapper, I invested in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as a method to simulate the reality of youth and unemployment to support the UNDP country office in sensing and exploring the solutions required to be embedded within the upcoming projects. It is worth noting, when we took a look at the existing analyses, reports and data, collected by different operating stakeholders and influentials in responding to unemployment challenges among youth, we found mainly that the vast majority of them share the points related to analyzing the political and economic situation in the country, and identified a need to focus on the psychological aspect and the impact of the surrounding factors on the graduates psyche, brain structure, and interaction with the employment opportunities, and what they truly feel.-Hence, we approached 710 youth from across the country, divided into students, unemployed and employed graduates, and youth who participated in the experimented local solutions mapped by the AccLab to simulate their brains using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on real data collected through a survey.-Artificial Neural Networks are built like the human brain, with neuron nodes interconnected like a web. They are a piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. In this blog, we used the Back-Propagation Algorithm training method of ANN in MATLAB 2014b.-The first simulation: The journey of unemployed graduates-Growing up in Iraq, dreams of becoming an engineer, a pilot, a teacher, a scientist and an artist get filtered according to the surrounding environment’s thoughts and experiences, standardized against the political, economic, and sociological structures. For example, when we simulated the first category that consists of 210 unemployed graduate youth brains in our ANN system, we noticed that they were completely saturated with the overrated realistic negative ideas about the future of employment in Iraq. For instance, their families, school teachers, and adults promote the huge gap between the educational system and the market needs, the unstable political and economic situation, and more inputs that we can see in the Pie chart below at the input stage of the ANN system.- - -Living with these overrated realistic negative ideas (challenges of employment) affected the sample in this model and cornered the graduates in their comfort zone with saturated braines, while preventing them from taking initiative to participate in the life changing opportunities. For example, If we take 10 samples from the ANNs system outputs, we will see that a 70% of them did not experience the employment, lacking access and interest in joining the self-development opportunities, and lacking the basic working skills as we can see in the chart below. While the shocking fact is that a higher percentage have either accepted employment irrelevant to their academic fields, dropped out of college and took common inappropriate methods to sustain stable income,  which is unexpected from this educated segment.- - -The Second Simulation: The journey of employed graduates-Differences in human brains are the main trigger for innovation, development, and is the base for structuring our human communities. To understand a different category of people within the scope of youth and employment, we simulated 129 employed graduate youth brains in our ANN system, we found out that they had similar environments of growth during their childhood, school, and academic life, including the economic and the political influence as the simulation in case 1.  In other words, they experienced a similar loop. Yet, the employed graduated youth had an intervening life-changing event that broke the loop. These exposed youth were later more open to living their skills up to the market needs, and they were later employed.-This loop was broken by the training and exchange programs, events, internships, summer training and voluntary activities that intervened in the lives of the graduated youth during their school and academic life. These loop-breaking elements had strengths that we defined in the Pie chart below as a second input for the ANN system.- - -We learned from this simulation that the youth whose brains are saturated with overrated realistic negative ideas about employment can be guided out of their comfort zone. By this exposure, they will be more open to self development, and will build a good understanding of the market needs and requirements. This results in having more employment opportunities, stable financial status, and more motivated brains to self-develop, which we observed among the 129 samples including 10 represented in the below chart. Those youth, when exposed to positive experiences, loop-breaking elements, led to success in their careers; those same elements, set of points and experiences that we analyzed, have been embedded in the local solutions we have identified. - - -The third simulation: The journey of applying the local solutions-In the Accelerator Lab, after the first and the second simulation cases, we built a good understanding of the local solutions that can work well with the saturated brains with the overrated realistic negative ideas. Now, we would like to study the effectiveness of seven identified local solutions by Accelerator Lab Iraq on the unemployed graduates of case 1, and see the potential for change in their surrounding environment.- - -We took the characteristics of the identified local solutions as second inputs for our ANN system based on case 2. These include: the motivating team-working environment for creativity and competition, interactive modern training materials, matching practical materials to market needs, building local and international cross-cultural networks, human-centered topics, peer to peer training, and the application of modern technologies.-This simulation resulted in surprising changes on the brains of unemployed  graduates in case 1. As they resulted in similar living conditions and higher chances of self-development as listed in the below chart.- - -Takeaways-Similar to creativity, there are no uncreative people; there are only people who forgot how to be creative. Employment, like many other characteristics in our lives, can be absorbed and structured by the community rather than only the individual effort as we think, therefore, it can be grown and inspired from the surrounding environment. -In the Accelerator Lab Iraq, 71% of our local solutions tackling youth and unemployment are intangible in the shape of training projects and programmes, youth initiatives, competitions, internships, summer training, and virtual campaigns, each with its own characteristics. This simulation helped us invest more efficiently in the sensing, exploring and growth of our local solutions. It ensured the mid-long-term effectiveness of the identified local solutions, and assisted us in setting the selection criteria for the upcoming local solutions mapping, exploring, and experimenting inside the Accelerator Lab in Iraq, up to the country office programs. Also, it sparked our minds to focus on the psychological aspect of the human in a process that can add a lot to the Human-Centered Design and collective intelligence approaches that we utilized to identify the local solutions. Also, this simulation results will add a lot to our upcoming blended learning project with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, that is highly focused on college students and professors. -Through this we learn the impact, we understand the influence of the details of our growth environment on our life decisions, interests, employability, and creativity. As our brain is always present, it is in continuous absorption of the inputs of the surrounding environment. Ready to grow, or to build boundaries that limit unexpected potential opportunities from happening in our life.- ","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11']","Innovation,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Hasan Al Rubaiey,Development Effectiveness,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 4  Quality education,In the news,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Iraq,Accelerator Labs,English"

At the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Iraq, we rely on Human-Centered Approach, specifically the use of Design Thinking Methodology, in the experimentation process. In this month’s blog, we highlight the experimentation process of three local solutions out of 100 mapped local solutions; Design Thinking Training Manual, INpoint platform, and Corona in Iraq Platform.-Design Thinking Methodology is an elastic way of thinking by the iterative process with five stages (Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Testing) to understand the target segement’s pain, challenge assumptions, identify the needs, and redefine problems in the aim of creating new strategies and solutions.-As per the AccLab Experimentation Strategy, we embedded the Design Thinking methodology to the DNA of each identified local solution as below: -Design Thinking Training Manual: The methodology was used as a method for generating innovative ideas to tackle complex problems and guide the process of the way of thinking with various stakeholders.-INpoint platform: The methodology was used to design the experimentation process by using Human-Centered Design and use it to guide the testing process.-Corona in Iraq Platform: the methodology was used to guide the design of content to be more user friendly and used to redesign the content for end-users through Corona in Iraq Platform. -Design Thinking Training Manual: Guiding to Ideation process -The Design Thinking Training Manual is a localized training manual specific to the Iraqi market that covers the five stages of Design Thinking and their tangible application to the Iraqi market represented by selected local entrepreneurial start-ups.  The Five Stages of Design Thinking are crucial in the analysis of problems as well as in ideating for potential solutions. This becomes even more important in countries like Iraq that have complex problems. To  embed the use of Design Thinking in Iraq and inside the UNDP Country Office, the UNDP Accelerator Lab took the oath to test this local solution. In order to perform the testing and measure the impact on the  local community and UNDP Country Office, we assumed the following hypothesis to tackle youth and unemployment, climate change, and gender challenges:-“If the Design Thinking Training Manual is used as an educational tool in designing local innovations  then the designers will be better at identifying the roots of complex problems  thus they will be able to  ideate for more practical innovations”-To test the validity of our hypothesis, the Accelerator Lab team in Iraq designed experiments  based on the Iraq experimentation strategy with +500 participants from various stakeholders including UNDP, academia sector, government sector, entrepreneurship ecosystem, local and international organizations and private sector.-During the experimentation activities, mainly the workshops, we observed signals of change in the mind-set of the participants during the first and second stages of Design Thinking (Empathy and Define); participants started to identify specific problems based on their capacities rather than tackling big problems. They started to see things from different points of view and realized  their capacities and limitations. This laid the groundwork  for the upcoming stage to find practical innovations with market needs. -Surprisingly, while testing the Manual with university’s teachers, the Acc Lab team concluded that the Design Thinking methodology is useful to improve the method of selecting graduation projects to be more fit for market needs, for both the teachers and the students. Thus, we focused on this topic and to encourage the students to design sustainable graduation projects  they can rely on after their graduation to make financially sustainable projects and to help the country in tackling current Challenges. Hence, we are working with University of Basrah, College of Agriculture to embed the Design Thinking Training Manual with the college curriculum.- - -INpoint Platform: Guiding the experimentation process -INpoint is an innovative virtual platform, web and mobile app, developed by UNDP's Innovation for Development project. It supports the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Iraq including, entrepreneurs, institutions, innovation hubs, private sector companies, and institutions interested in Sustainable Development Goals in Iraq. It aims to provide an environment for learning and cooperation, exchanging experiences, and building partnerships inside the entrepreneurship ecosystems in Iraq.-One of the main features of the Design Thinking Methodology is its flexibility, and the UNDP Acc Lab in Iraq utilized  this feature in the experimentation of this platform. The main aim behind using Design thinking Methodology is to incorporate other methodologies to achieve the designed goals while verifying its features to be more human-centered, to find the best way of making the targeted people use it, and to build an ecosystem around this platform. To achieve the target, we assumed the below hypothesis:-“If Design Thinking Methodology is used to design the experimentation processes of INpoint platform, then behaviors and insights of target people will be extracted, thus developing the platform’s users experience” -To verify the hypothesis and based on the AccLab experimentation strategy, we built a team of eight volunteers (50% female) from the community activists to be part of the experimentation process.-Since the INpoint platform aims to create a connected entrepreneurial ecosystem, then Design Thinking methodology can be used in parallel with Behavioural Insights to observe users' journey with the existing platform features. Hence,  the AccLab team invited 20 participants to hold a two-hour demo session that resulted in observing the users' behavior and identifying the pains, gains, interest and priorities through using this prototype. The collected insights led us to map the system again, identify the gaps and then define the challenges that face the users with the existing prototype in order to move forward for solving the problems and developing the platform regarding users' needs.-Following the Define Stage, the team decided to expand the targeted segments of testers in order to co-redesign the platform features by developing its UI/UX design and fixing the bugs of features.-To minimize the risk of failure, the second wave of experimentation just started by opening an online form to invite the targeted segments to join the platform gradually. Hence, 670 forms have been received to date that they will be considered as a sample for a small-entrepreneurial ecosystem inside the platform to observe their behaviour for the upcoming 3 months. -During this experimentation journey, we discovered that in such radical solutions that make change in an existing system, we need to gradually embed the concept of change but also tailor it with a gamified approach in order to gain the target segment attention. Hence, we are developing the gamified module in response to the insights from the two rounds of experimentation; this approach is designed to provide a reward system with a set of desired actions through points and badges (to level up in this virtual gamified environment). - - -Corona in Iraq Platform: Designing the content for the end-user -Since the start of the Corona pandemic, the UNDP AccLab team in Iraq commenced sensing and exploring the local solutions to respond to COVID-19 and support Iraqi government efforts to confront this pandemic. Hence, the need for accessible tools for information disminisassion and an easy way to track COVID19 symptoms was identified after performing the system’s mapping and observing the targeted segments needs. The local solution that best addresses this critical point is Corona in Iraq platform, a local solution developed by an Iraqi young developer.-After the successful launching, we began mentoring and evaluating to measure its impact on people's lives by analyzing the data provided by Google Analytics. Statistics indicated that  the number of users was decreasing, indicating that people were not craving the content as much as they did when the site was launched back in April. This could be due to the saturation of information regarding COVID-19 and an adjustment to the new normal.-This insight led us to use the Design Thinking Methodology to identify the root causes and to lead us to the right solution in order to overcome this challenge. Hence, the process showed the importance of re-designing the user interface and the user experience of the platform to be more localized with human-centered content. Now we are in the stage of redesigning the platform according to the User Journey mapping.- - -The use of design thinking methodology in different domains and with different stakeholders showed us that the methodology is not magic, it is a mindset and a way of thinking. It supports our experiments in order to link our activities and solutions with the needs of the local community. Next, we will use Design Thinking Methodology to develop the agriculture projects inside the Academia Sector.- ","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Innovation,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Noor Al-Kamoosi,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Arab states,Iraq,Design Thinking,English,Accelerator Labs"

How can we respond to it? The UNDP YLP 6 in Iraq searched for an answer to this question. -In Iraq, there are many ideas and solutions that tackle climate change,  but the main challenge is that they aren't identified and understood by the local community. There is a strong need for innovative solutions to tackle climate change especially considering  Iraq’s status as  one of the most-affected countries in the Arab region.-To address the above challenges, the ""Youth Leadership Programme"" have been working with young people from all Arab countries since 2015, using  youth creativity to serve the communities,  technology and innovation to make daily lifestyle changes to protect the environment like using a reusable bottles, minimizing energy usage, and Growing more plants at home.-This year, UNDP Iraq is planning to expand its work to support Climate change solutions with the UNDP's Environment, Energy and Climate Change (EECC) in Iraq, starting with a call for innovators through its Ideation Challenge for Climate Change, implemented through cooperation between Youth Leadership Programme and the Accelerator Lab. This initiative built the capacities of Youth Serving Organizations in using the Design Thinking Training Manual, analyzing climate change challenges, building the theme of Youth Leadership Programme (YLP6) for 2020, which is the climate change. -The initiative called for the analysis of climate change challenges and the ideation of potential local solutions using Human-centered design with a targeted audience from the active Youth Service Organizations (YSOs) in Iraq. Fifty-seven youth from 17 YSOs across Iraq have participated in the call for Innovation.- - -Engaging youth in the preservation of the environment is critical to changing their behavior and attitude, in addition to empowering them through education and capacity building. The goal is to establish an enabling environment where young people can contribute to building a sustainable future. The Call for Innovations followed the five stages of the Design thinking methodology to analyze the challenges and ideate for potential solutions.  -The process provided a fresh perspective and helped to define the priorities of the Iraqi people in the climate change context. The challenge analysis phase led to identifying the four main challenges of climate change in Iraq: -The lack of youth interest in climate change issues;-The use of materials that cause pollution in  energy production;- The accumulation of waste with no established methods of disposals and recycling; and -Lack of water, and the spread of desertification  in some areas all over the country.-Reaching the ideation phase and finding an answer to the question  ""How do you know your idea is the next big thing?"" takes two key characteristics: curiosity and innovation. Curiosity requires being innate about people, and the problems they face. Innovation is an expertise that can be developed as an individual or as a group, to find insights that lead to product development.-The ideation phase helped to establish a portfolio of solutions for climate change, and the challenge itself pioneered the development and implementation of six solutions for sustainable development (see graph below.) -What is clear through the 2030 Agenda is that sustainable development and tackling climate change go hand-in-hand.-We cannot ensure sustainable cities and communities without protecting them from storms or floods; and we cannot ensure children are healthy without addressing the changes in vector-borne diseases due to changing temperatures. The list goes on, and that’s why UNDP is prioritizing adapting and scaling innovative approaches to achieving the sustainable development goals – especially when it comes to climate action.- - -One of the key insights of the Call for Innovation is that all solutions were tech inspired, in response to the move to digitalization due to COVID19 pandemic. as Albert Einstein once said: ""We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them”. Since these problems are complex and require innovation to tackle, and this is simply what ideation is all about, it helps us to ask the right questions and innovate because what one person deems to be a great idea might not be the same view shared by the market and targeted audience.- ",[],"Innovation,Zainab Almashref,Iraq,Development Effectiveness,Blog post"

This learning process enabled us, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Iraq, to sense, explore, and lay the ground for experimentation around the  digitalization of curriculum implementation, and upskilling  within higher education.-Despite the COVID-19 Response, including lockdown and public health measures to ensure social distancing, Iraq has reported around 154,000 Coronavirus cases, witnessed an almost 29% budgetary deficit due to collapse of oil prices, and is forecasting an economic collapse by almost  9.7% accompanied by an increase in poverty by 40% due to lose of economic opportunities.  With this in mind, the Accelerator Lab in Iraq is learning to map  the new forces of economic opportunity. But, how can we equip our youth better for the changing labor market structure and most importantly how can we create added value for the economy?-We dig deeper into our unique learning process both in its component parts - including our own exploration methodologies, as well as learning how these methodologies can support us in ‘building back better’ in our communities, and how young Iraqis can co opt this process too!-Part 1: What do our exploration methodologies shed light on?-Our exploration methodologies and foresight framework teach us to take available data, analyze it and produce insights to guide our way. As a part of framing the challenge for youth and unemployment and defining the key issues and current conditions with the relevant stakeholders, the Lab held two workshops in December 2019 to perform systems mapping, draw the causality loop, and  develop a hypothesis framework  to narrow down the challenge of youth and unemployment. The product of the framing resulted in and focus specifically on “Tunnel-Vision Employment” within Iraqi youth. The analysis resulted in a specific focus on academia and considered it the main factor behind the limitation youth put on their career options and the existing gap between market required skills and the supply of skills by academia.  In order to further analyze the issue, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Iraq drew a causality loop for the current academic sector - a diagram that allows for visualizing how the different variables in the academic sector are interrelated. This process was done with six representatives from Iraqi ministries and nine representatives from the entrepreneurial ecosystem and it resulted into insights: -The sequence of the tunnel-vision of employment amongst academia, that drives the learning process in Iraq and hence affects students’ skills and knowledge, includes four main parts: curriculum implementation, teachers, universities, and students. -After drawing the causality loop, curriculum implementation seemed to be the critical point that drove all others, and is our base to equip youth with more skills to function in the job market. -The critical point for an intervention was identified. Now, our role as Heads of Explorations was to scan existing efforts to change, and qualify their implications for systematic impact; simply perform what is called “Mapping Signals of Change”.  However, in the process of looking for emerging trends to break the status-quo and identify the factors that would break the causality loop, COVID-19 hit. Now it has become more relevant to map signals in this new reality, the reality of a pandemic and its multitude of impacts all over the world!
- - -Part 2: How COVID-19 broke the causality loop of “Tunnel-Vision Employment” within the academic sector? -Our sensing and exploring work are crucial, but is now even more relevant in the fast-changing world of COVID-19. The use of data, mapping of stakeholders and weak signals, anticipating possible changes and ultimately treating the pandemic as an opportunity is important to reveal both the challenges and opportunities for youth and unemployment in Iraq. In order to zoom in on the effect of these sources of change and inform UNDP Iraq of the next steps of intervention, the Accelerator Lab undertook Mapping Signals of change  to identify:-1. What would the new normal look like?-2. What are the surfacing  needs in the academic sector in response to COVID-19?-3. How could these provide a window of opportunity to break the existing causality loop of ‘Tunnel-Vision Employment’? -The Accelerator Lab used both the usual research methods (online, articles, research, and the work of other organizations) as well as personalized meetings. The meeting process started by identifying the stakeholders to provide insights - including stakeholders from UNDP, development agencies, private sector, government institutions, local and international NGOs, entrepreneurs, innovation hubs, and research centers. The analysis of the research and discussion content led to the uncovering of four weak signals: emergence of e-learning, virtual capacity building modalities, online-shopping, and e-payment. All the signals directly and indirectly evolve around changes in the academic sector and the future structure of the labor market in Iraq. For now we will focus on the most prominent signals across all our research, e-learning. -In order to investigate further the effect of e-learning on the academic sector, especially the relationship between the curriculum implementation and e-learning, we will hypothesis:-To validate the hypothesis activities, the Accelerator Lab initiated focus-groups discussion and observations. The results produced valuable information. First, both public and private learning institutions instructed all schools and universities to facilitate classes online using Google Classrooms, Zoom meetings, Free Conference Call (FCC), and other tools to substitute for in-class learning. Second, the local community, and specifically aspiring Iraqi youth, are catching up and providing e-learning solutions specific to Iraqis needs, like the Newton Platform, Najeh platform, and the My Journey with 6th Grade project. 
-From above, we can observe that the use of e-learning has led to a shift in curriculum implementation techniques for both teachers and students; teachers started giving lectures and using online methods as well as structuring their evaluation methods virtually. This is a temporary break in the causality loop, but this break needs to be further structured and institutionalized.- - - -Part 3: From e-learning to blended learning, how these methodologies are supporting us in ‘building back better’ for our education system and future employment opportunities?-The e-learning signal is emerging, but it is a weak signal that only acquired such great attention due to the pandemic. Now the question is how can we sustain this break in the causality loop and aim to change the curriculum implementation guidance and process, while working towards institutionalizing it?  -The good news is that the pandemic provides a tremendous window of opportunity to strengthen this signal. And, we have already started to see incoherent but strategic efforts to institutionalize change in curriculum implementation. -The UNDP Accelerator Lab held two searchlight events with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR) to further validate the hypothesis. The events shed light on efforts for change to the implementation of the curriculum within MoHESR and private universities. MoHESR started advocating for the enhanced professional development of Iraqi teachers in technological skills to further localize e-learning. Private universities with more resources also started investing in technological infrastructure in order to lay the ground for a long-term shift in teaching methods. -All these scattered efforts led to change in the implementation mechanism of the curriculum temporarily, but they also have aspects of a permanent change to blended-learning. Blended-learning includes the use of offline and online methods for teaching. This commitment towards the institutionalization of blended-learning was expressed vocally by  the Head of Development and Human Resources Department at MoHESR “the ministry aims to move to blended learning in order to provide a way to overcome the sudden shocks that hit the consistency of the education process”. - - -This digitalization, and the alteration of the labor market structure, will shape the future of work in Iraq. Our research yields that in the long run if this change is institutionalized - considering the futures change wheel and quick response time - we might not witness a sharp decrease in unemployment, but rather a change in students’ behaviour and the structure of the job market. For students, it will provide more learning opportunities to the most vulnerable, increase the tendency toward learning the digital skills that are in high demand in the job market, and expand the depth and breadth of the Iraqi openness to the world. For the job market, this will lead to high demand for digital innovators, a technologically skilled workforce, software and graphic designers, and career counselors. But most importantly this will encourage professionals to develop their own set of skills without demanding permanent employment and shifting to more self-employment.  For  the overall market, all the weak signals, identified in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic, establish a case for movement towards digitalization, which should lead to more efficiency and economic value generation.-In this blog, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Iraq investigated and explored the hypothesis to foresee before anyone else the importance of blended learning; the next phase will be experimenting the hypothesis and validating the hypothesis through paving the road for blended learning. Currently, MoHSER and UNDP are in the process of establishing a partnership to develop a roadmap for blended learning in Iraq. - ","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Innovation,Safa Fadhil Al-Qoch,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Arab states,Iraq,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs,English"

During this time, the country has been confronted with several crises, including the continued activity of ISIL, social inequality, nation-wide anti-government protests, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Adding to already difficult circumstances, rebuilding damaged relationships and transforming grievances face-to-face has become temporarily impossible in the fight against the pandemic. During the first months of the pandemic and with the new imperative of social distancing, online formats have had to suffice as an alternative for meaningful in-person exchange.-Whilst the immediate response activities must take precedence in order to ensure that Iraq’s national health system has better capacity to support the increasing number of people being treated for COVID-19 - including the establishment of 180 isolation rooms in 13 healthcare facilities across 12 governorates -  questions of how the newly established discipline of Peace Studies in Iraq can continue to flourish, must be explored. Ahead of International Youth Day, we consider how the continued engagement of young Iraqis in the study of peace and Peace Education are critical to the continued sustainable development and future resilience of Iraq.-UNDP Iraq and Iraqi Al-Amal Association started the first phase of a Peace Education project in August 2016, aiming to enable Iraqi universities to have better influence on peace and conflict transformation. In July 2018, the project was joined by the University of Innsbruck, collaborating on the design of a post-graduate Diploma for Peace and Conflict Studies curriculum.-Throughout the four project phases:-In the context of Europe and North America, Peace Studies was founded as a direct academic response to the destruction resulting from two world wars and against an understanding that the mere prevention of war and violence is by far not enough to evoke constructive change. Later its development was further fueled by debates of anti-colonialism, as well as civil wars around the world, which often placed questions of social justice and historic truth into the center of the debate. So, what is the state-of-affairs for Peace Studies in Iraq? Can Peace Studies build a foundation for improved and meaningful dialogue amongst state actors and civil society, that recognizes young Iraqis as central agents of change?-While the interpretation and application of Peace and Conflict Studies across different contexts is characterized by significant differences, there is a common denominator: a focus on the potential of re-exploring relationships that have been scattered, perhaps even broken, against the experience of conflict and to understand their qualities and possibilities. As a result, over decades, academics and practitioners have developed innovative ways to analyze these complex realities and created useful tools for conflict transformation. Many of them share the insight that change does not come rapidly, but that it rather requires the continuous efforts of generations who gradually take up the task of bridging divides.-The new generation of young activists, for whom the capacities of peace and conflict transformation are essential to identify and respond to their community needs, utilize creative approaches such as art, music, and sport, combined with community outreach, to connect with people of different faiths, ages, cultures and habits. They also capitalize on the use of tools like social media for solidarity building and generating a culture of civic engagement. This relative independence and sense of ownership over the peace process, allows them to perform diverse activities and engage with supporters. But there is still room for enhancing these capacities and structures, to improve sustainability and contribute to the resilience of Iraqi communities.-So, while we begin to understand the role of young people (and their educators) as agents of change in the wider context of peace in Iraq, how too can we understand their role in the context of the COVID-19 crisis? While the frontline health workers and medical doctors are critical for the care and recovery of individuals being treated for COVID-19, we must not forget the progress already made in Iraq, in terms of its recovery from decades of violent conflict and war. In fact, in times of crisis when conflict can often escalate, we can see the small ways in which an understanding of peace and conflict transformation may be an important skill – such as within families who are being confronted with growing tensions as their routines are interrupted.-Since the pandemic first reached Iraq in March 2020, we have witnessed young Iraqis – and in particular those who have engaged in Peace and Conflict studies –demonstrate the power of understanding, of inter-ethnic and community solidarity and the lasting hope that is created when we are able to bridge a divide. Both young women and men have shown great enthusiasm and passion to respond to the needs of their communities and advocate for social solidarity to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. To date, we have seen several practical and innovative initiatives aimed at reaching out to vulnerable and marginalized groups. More than 3.3 million Iraqis have benefited from the Iraqi civil society response to the pandemic including UNDP’s support to local volunteer groups to disseminate 4,150 food baskets. Each time a food basket is delivered, the community is reminded that support for one another – especially in times of crisis – is critical for Iraq to prosper.  -Iraqi volunteer groups are mainly youth led, conducting activities for humanitarian aid, coexistence, and community awareness raising. These groups are highly flexible and adaptable to the changing contexts and have the ability to take shortcuts to deliver required assistance, assistance that is not easy for governments, the UN or NGOs to provide as quickly.-It would be a mistake to look at Iraq merely through a COVID-19-crisis lens. The country has gone through multiple crises in recent years, some of them are continuous. While the pandemic requires many immediate responses, Peace and Conflict Studies’ key question of how relationships can be rebuilt in a post-war multiple-crisis context needs to be addressed with good attention and priority.- -Co-authors-Aala Ali is the Senior Project Officer for Peace Education with UNDP Iraq and Coordinator of the UNDP-funded project ""Education for Peace in the Iraqi Higher Education System"".

In Iraq, the UNDP Accelerator Lab team is committed to laying down the methodologies to investigate the environmental challenges in today’s world. Here, we will run you through our methodologies, assumptions, hypotheses, insights and learnings that drove us to disaggregate the reasons behind the lack of responsibility and ownership amongst the community in relation to climate change issues in Iraq.-The systems-mapping process commenced with business-as-usual (research and consultation) to frame the problem and understand the different dimensions from the perspective of people closest to the Iraq Accelerator Lab, starting from the UNDP Environment Energy and Climate Change pillar (EECC) team, where we conducted a baseline study to determine the status-quo. Then, we enlarged the wave of our learning from the core by looking for data via offline and online search tools. The first wave revealed two findings:-●      There is a lack of research on climate change in Iraq; and-●      There is an environmental ecosystem in Iraq but despite government work, it still requires more efforts to unite in one vision-The above findings increased our curiosity and here the wave led  us to start mapping the relevant stakeholders, connect the dots, and define the scope of the problem. The actors-mapping started by mapping the sectors and identifying at least one actor from each sector; this was by no means a very accurate move but we wanted to establish the starting points. Next, different actors started connecting us to others and soon we were able to collect 12 official stakeholders to participate in a one-day searchlight event to discuss the challenges of climate change in Iraq, followed by another day to perform analysis of the challenges. The later part was conducted via launching and using the Mission 1.5 game. For the first time, different stakeholders from UNDP EECC, government institutions (Ministry of Health and Environment (MoHE) & Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research MoHESR), private sector, academic sector, and local NGOs worked together to map the current environmental system in Iraq through analysing the stages of the game.-As a result of the first and second waves, the systems-mapping approach uncovered a gap between the official stakeholders' work on climate change and the community. Mainly, that the work of the officials is not being recognized, acknowledged, materialized, and followed by the community to drive necessary change. -The Accelerator Lab went to the community to perform sensemaking and exploring for both the way of thinking, and the behaviors of the community in response to climate change issues. While at the same time, discovering approaches to identify and incentivise stakeholders to raise the community’s sense of responsibility towards climate change.-In the current context of COVID-19 virtual communication is our only method to reach the community and perform sensemaking to try and bridge the gap. First, the Accelerator Lab reached the community through an online survey to investigate people's interest and willingness to participate in climate change workshops. The workshop was intended for young people who have minimum information but maximum passion to learn and help tackle climate change challenges. In a sample of 236 participants, 68% of the survey participants expressed their desire to participate in a workshop on climate change in Iraq. Responding to the demands of Iraqi youth, the Accelerator Lab held a two-hour virtual workshop with a selected sample of the participants to investigate their general knowledge on climate change, the reasons why it is not prioritized by Iraqi people, as well as the best approach and leverage points to tackle such an alarming issue in a timely manner. To our surprise, the questions we asked were too much for youth, and there should be an approach that both incentivises youth to learn about climate change, and teaches them the basics.- - -To incentivise the community, we need to present the work currently being implemented by the officials, as well as perform actors-mapping to identify community actors who can influence people’s interests, and combine that with an innovative learning approach. Here a question came to our minds: “What are the innovative methods and tools that could be used to motivate youth and local organizations to increase people’s knowledge and sense of responsibility when it comes to climate change issues in Iraq?”-The team tested two innovative approaches that could be used to both increase people’s interest in climate change, and accelerate their learning path. The first one is using gamification to recognize the priorities of the community with the Mission 1.5 game, a global UNDP initiative focused on raising community awareness about climate change and encouraging them to be part of the Environmental policy-making process. The aim of this approach was to maximize engagement of youth players and inspire them to question their daily behaviors and decisions and understand their impact on climate change in Iraq. -The second innovative approach was to use a human-centered approach to disaggregate the learning question as well as ideate potential solutions to the issue. The Accelerator Lab team worked with the UNDP Youth Leadership Programme, our eyes in the community, and launched a 20-hour Call for Innovations: Ideation Challenge on Climate Change which uses the Design Thinking methodology to implement its activities, and assumed:- -If the Design Thinking methodology is used with the community, then more people will be interested in focusing on climate change and increase their sense of responsibility towards the environment.-The virtual call for innovations includes two phases, the problem phase and the solution phase. The first two sessions focused on the problem phase and were broken down into two steps: empathy (discovering) and defining. During the first two stages of design thinking, young people from 17 local organizations analyzed the main problems about climate change in Iraq, they identified the effective actors and stakeholders, and determined the findings and relevant insights. In the second two stages, youth began to think out-of-the-box, using the concept of entrepreneurship, creating the ideas, and prototyping the new applicable solutions. -The testing stage was in the form of in-workshop evaluation and also opinion gathering from the public using social media channels. For the latter part, the participants shared their ideas on social media and received feedback, which enhanced their knowledge and broadened their views, allowing them to  adjust their ideas. The second testing phase included posting the complete ideas on social media. The aim was to present both the problem and the solution through a post to gauge reactions while also increasing the Arabic content about climate change.-During the design thinking methodology, we motivated young people to take a journey of sensing and exploring problems related to climate change in Iraq and to increase their information and knowledge about the importance of finding local and innovative solutions that help governments, UNDP and other stakeholders respond to Iraq’s environmental challenges.-The insights gained from this sensing, exploring and experimentation phase are invaluable. Next, the Accelerator Lab in Iraq will work on localizing climate change issues through increasing content both written and visual content about climate change. Also, we will continue systems-mapping to identify more gaps when it comes to community responsibility towards climate change issues, and lay the groundwork to establish a connected climate change ecosystem in Iraq.","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Innovation,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Safa Fadhil Al-Qoch,Hasan Al Rubaiey,Goal 15  Life on land,Noor Al-Kamoosi,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Iraq,English,Accelerator Labs"

The resulting rise in Zoonotic diseases like COVID-19 – the kind transmitted from animals to humans – was not only inevitable in these conditions, but a setup for serious setbacks in human development.-Yet, despite repeated warnings, which heralded the advent of COVID-19, action towards risk-informed resilience building is woefully inadequate.-The 2021 Global Health Security Index concluded that despite some progress and nearly two years into the pandemic, all countries remain “dangerously unprepared” for the next major outbreak.-This is our wake-up call to strengthen resilience to current and future pandemics.-We must seek to systematically understand the nature, manifestation, and impact of our vulnerabilities as it to relates to pandemics like COVID-19.-Reducing known vulnerabilities is a key ingredient in any agenda for improving human development, advises Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Laureate in Economics. He further states that if we are to succeed, we need to approach vulnerabilities from a broad systemic perspective.-This is why the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) – an important ingredient in dismantling barriers to resilience – was the tool of choice in a global COVID-impact study of 126 countries conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The findings indicate that except for five Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the remaining SIDS were far more vulnerable than their income level would suggest. More importantly, the findings strengthen the call of international advocates for concessional financing for middle and high-income countries based on their vulnerabilities and not their income classification.  -Vulnerabilities revealed through a recent MVI study – Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID 19 and Policy Options for Jamaica – highlight lessons learned that can also inform Jamaica’s approach to reducing vulnerabilities. I shared specific findings in a recent Year in review Op Ed. Today I share key takeaways and recommendations as we contemplate the way forward.-First and foremost, we learn that: High levels of vaccine hesitancy indicate formidable barriers of perception that can derail future disaster risk management strategies; mental health services are not sufficiently accessible to deal with the explosion of pandemic related mental health challenges (57%) reported by respondents; inequities in research and development capacities in vaccine innovation development in the region will continue to impact vaccine supply; the significant levels of learning loss expose the digital divide especially inequalities in access; the most vulnerable groups are those with disabilities, women, middle income earners (surprisingly) and those outside the social safety  net.-There were other valuable lessons that challenged our notions of who are really vulnerable: The number of persons who say they are not on the main social safety net programme (58%) is almost twice as high as those who say they are unemployed or lacking in income; The most vulnerable parishes overall, are rural (St. Mary, St Ann, Manchester) but, persons in urban areas are more vulnerable than those in rural areas; Women are slightly more vulnerable than men, but more so in urban areas; individuals with the lowest household monthly income do not have the highest level of vulnerability.-These vulnerabilities, exposed by the MVI, must be addressed with the broad systemic approach championed by Stiglitz, or they will remain as barriers to resilience.-First step in this systemic approach is tackling the roots of the crisis – unsustainable and unhealthy practices which give rise to zoonotic diseases. Going to the root also means deployment of adequate budgets for climate change adaptation and the environment including eco system restoration to disrupt the progress of zoonotic diseases. Yet we sense a lack of urgency in concrete action or advocacy to address this critical foundational challenge. SIDS must rise up united on this issue.-We must become more adept at identifying and addressing vulnerability – consistently – as an established practice. This does not nullify the strong tradition of evidence-based policy development at the national and regional levels. We simply recommend another layer of interrogation focused on uncovering vulnerabilities, as MVI data helps strengthen targeted approaches to risk reduction.-It will also be important to secure behavioral insights into the barriers to vaccine uptake to inform behavioral and social change campaigns. Otherwise, low vaccination rates will hinder national progress towards a resilient society.  -Once we start to generate a wealth of vulnerability data, we propose the development of a Data Hub and Policy Lab platform to house these findings and to facilitate monitoring and evaluation of programmes being implemented to reduce vulnerability. This should provide the evidence for a risk-informed integration of resilience into all levels of governance and operations.-We must then move to ensure that transactions of all kinds can be quickly migrated into the digital space without disruption, should the pandemic persist in intensity, or other variations arise. This means fast-tracking the digital society to ensure continuity in commerce, education, and developmental opportunities during a crisis. UNDP is honoured to support Jamaica’s progressive journey in this regard by partnering on a Digital Readiness Survey, a diagnostic survey exercise designed to secure rapid, high-level insights into a country’s digital strengths and weaknesses.-The digital space must be inclusive. We must therefore enhance and redesign platforms to accommodate persons with different types of impairments and abilities. This should be part and parcel of a concerted effort to increase targeting of those most likely to be left behind.   -The MVI exercise also reaffirmed the need to strengthen the social safety net and was able to identify locations and population groups most marginalized from this service. The data also indicated that the social safety net should include mental health support services. These services must be accessible, user friendly and normalized to remove associated stigmas.-A major component of the preparatory work for a pandemic-resilient society is in coordinating multilateral diplomacy and advocacy. We must aim to ensure that vaccine supplies quickly get into the hands of developing countries. Now is also the time to boost national and regional research and development capacities so vaccines can one day be produced and manufactured in the region for local consumption and export.  -Though much has been said and done about economic resilience, we must ensure the vulnerable Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector – the backbone of commerce, services and jobs – is not left out of resilience measures. Their vulnerability translates into a vulnerability for the economy. For this reason, this sector must be strengthened to withstand shocks. We recommend improving mechanisms for data collection on MSMEs; improving sector development and coordination; and promoting greater adoption of digital means for transacting business. In so doing there will be an added layer of protection to national economies in the event of crisis.-Vulnerability matters! Understanding the complex and nuanced ways it manifests in your communities, sectors and population groups is a foundation on which nations can fortify against pandemics.-The best time to start the process was yesterday. The next best time is now.  -Mandeep Dhaliwal, Director of the HIV and Health Group, UNDP, underpins the eternally optimistic approach we must adopt if we are to build a resilient future. “The pandemic can be a pivotal moment in history. One that propels us out of a state in which we were not prepared, sleepwalking toward the next pandemic, and turning a blind eye to widening inequalities, towards a world prepared for the next pandemic.”- -Denise E Antonio is UNDP Resident Representative to Jamaica, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands.

The UNDP Multi Country Office in Jamaica has been able to celebrate such moments in our programme interventions in 2021, due in large measure to the hard work, investments and energy of our partners in government, donor agencies, civil society and communities. But then there are moments that must be ranked as really special, because they contain powerful potential to strengthen growth prospects and our strategic response to crisis.-Such a special moment arrived unexpectedly between the pages of a COVID-19 impact report. More precisely, that moment came courtesy of a few thousand Jamaicans who shared groundbreaking information that made it to the pages of that report. UNDP had commissioned the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute for Social and Economic Studies and the Caribbean Policy Research Institute (CAPRI) to conduct a Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Jamaica and Policy Options in Jamaica - one year after the pandemic. More than 3000 interviews combined with secondary data from studies previously conducted, is illuminating previously unseen layers of impact. Our Surge team utilized UNDP’s Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) – a first for any study in Jamaica – to measure and rank parishes and population groups according to 12 indicators called deprivations. This is reportedly the first systematic identification of the vulnerable segments of the society who have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Deprivations measured were: Covid-19 test status; Access to health center; Disability; Mental health; Wellbeing; Food consumption; Food quality; School attendance; Employment status; Income; Social protection; and Assistance (from friends or family). Vulnerabilities were confirmed if groups and locations scored in four or more deprivations. (download report )-Most Vulnerable and least vulnerable parishes -St. Mary was assessed as the most vulnerable parish to the impacts of COVID-19 in four or more of the 12 indicators assessed – closely followed by Manchester then St Ann. The parishes of St. Thomas, Trelawny and Westmoreland were assessed as the least vulnerable. A deeper probe of the data revealed that the main differences between St Mary, and the least vulnerable parish, Trelawny, came down to four factors: Access to health centres; income, food quality and social protection. The factors separating the second most vulnerable parish, Manchester, and Trelawny came down to: Access to health services; wellbeing; food consumption; and school attendance. A comparative review revealed more surprises: Urban areas bear a disproportionate load of vulnerability in contrast with their population share. Our data showed 70% of individuals in urban areas are vulnerable compared to 63% in rural areas. Interestingly, respondents with the lowest household income did not necessarily have the highest level of vulnerability. In fact, individuals earning salaries of 200 000 to just under 300 000 JMD per month were assessed as more vulnerable than persons earning 50 000 JMD per month and less. This is perhaps one of the most surprising findings. Overall, respondents were most vulnerable with respect to mental health, social protection and assistance, with mental health topping the vulnerability spectrum at 57% of respondents.-This definitive record of impact and vulnerability in Jamaica provides significant evidence for targeted interventions with more precise resource allocation. Our people are speaking. They are saying that COVID-19 has not just impacted lower income groups, or education, income and economy. As such, our interventions must expand to mental health, nutrition and other variables that redefine people’s lives and impact their ability to contribute meaningfully to social and economic development. We must pay closer attention to urban lower income pockets and more so to rural parishes which may escape the spotlight because of lower COVID 19 infection rates. We are also learning to listen carefully to how people rank their needs. This can be far more telling than the numbers. The Socioeconomic Impact Assessment tells us that respondents indicated their needs as Money (76.1%); Food (49.9%); Masks and Sanitizers (41.8%); and Health Insurance (28.1%) in that order.-Economic and sectoral findings are not so surprising. The Jamaican economy contracted by one fifth and lost 150 000 jobs at its lowest point. Nearly 50 per cent of businesses reported reduction in sales and more than 50% indicated that their operation would not last more than 6 months. The hardest hit industry was the entertainment, cultural and creative sector which suffered losses amounting to $195 billion and 76,000 jobs; hotels and restaurants which contracted 88% with 75% of workers laid off; and transport, storage, communications which contracted by 20 percent at the lowest point. Findings related to social protection also indicated that about 55.7% of PATH beneficiaries stated that they did not know how to apply for support to reduce negative impact of COVID-19. The study was also able to confirm a high level of vaccine hesitancy in Jamaica; only 33.9% said they would take the vaccine. These cumulative findings represent significant development losses that must be urgently addressed. It also requires us to look beyond the numbers to the human faces at the centre and to step into the shoes of the people who are hurting the most. To a mid-income person earning comparatively comfortable wages, impact may not be measured by a reduction in income but a reduction in living standards, loss of physical and mental health and non-qualification for state support. A 57% reported impact on mental health holds destructive capacity to hemorrhage man hours, people potential and economic growth.-This tells us that any lags in digital readiness may also represent an opportunity cost in potential income streams and vital information to guide evidence-based interventions where they are most needed and effective.  In the era of COVID-19 and shocks and crises precipitated by Climate Change, efficient crisis response anchored on accessible and reliable data will be a requirement for future proofing.-Breaking new ground by measuring vulnerability-This study ranks first among my top four moments for 2021, not only because it breaks new ground in redefining impact based on useful vulnerability measures but provides the basis for more efficient and targeted interventions that can accelerate developmental gains pertinent to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Vision 2030.  -There is mounting support for measuring and scoping vulnerabilities as part of the criteria for ranking countries and determining their access to resources. UNDP has consistently called for measuring growth and impacts beyond income and this was recently reiterated by CARICOM Secretary General, Carla Barnett at UNCTAD XV in October. I endorse her calls for continued advocacy for the further development and acceptance of the Multi-Dimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI), not only to define other pertinent layers of data for targeted response, but to open access to concessional resources for development financing and resilience building.   -Unleash the blue and green economies
-As the pandemic persists, we must remain resolute in advancing more sustainable models of development as a part of our resilience infrastructure. UNDP continued to advance the case for a green and nature-based approach to development as a ‘win-win’ for economic growth and environmental sustainability through a robust climate and disaster resilience portfolio in 2021.  With grant funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology, UNDP finalized the retrofitting of six public hospitals with LED bulbs and installed grid-tied solar photovoltaic systems at three of the six. Internal analysis indicates the solar and LED investments can save $348,944 USD per annum and save the public health sector 22% of its current energy bill annually. It is my 2021 moment number two because a low carbon pathway is a cost effective and efficient alternative to fossil fuel energy models, releasing more operational budgets for critical areas of health sector development. It also boots the resilience of the sector by lessening its reliance on fossil fuel supplies which can become delayed due to supply chain disruptions, especially in global crises.  -Those at the epidentre of crime must be integrated into crime prevention
-Finally, we remain convinced that strengthening growth prospects and our strategic response to crisis is best served by significantly reducing crime rates and improving the security and safety of our citizens. We know young people stand at the epicentre as the main perpetrators and victims of crime. Why are they not integrated into more leadership roles? To this end, UNDP invested grant funding, technical training and mentorship in 10 youth organizations to innovate and lead citizen safety and security interventions. Backed by our partnerships with the Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Education, Youth and Information, UNESCO Caribbean, Private Sector Organization of Jamaica and Rise Life Management Services, novel approaches birthed from fresh minds are starting to take root. Stand out projects include anti bullying campaigns to cut dysfunctional behaviors from the root; sign language training and services to support filing of police reports by the deaf community; and peace ambassador training and mentorship to build a culture of peace and non-violence in hot spot communities. My number three spot goes to the young people who are spearheading these micro projects, and who convened a Youth Summit on Crime and Violence on International Peace Day to further amplify their joint message that ending crime needs the participation and integration of youth.-Protect our women and children by strengthening laws  -Rounding out 2021’s top four make-or-break spots for advancing growth and resilience is the policy and legislative work carried out by civil society organizations under the umbrella of the Spotlight Initiative to address violence against women and girls. Our civil society partners work with the underserved and the hardest cases bringing empathetic interventions to women and girls in need. This joint European Union-United Nations programme has brought significant attention to the plight of females in crisis and challenged harmful gender norms that perpetuate cycles of violence. We need to urgently address legislative gaps to chip away at these sub cultural monoliths, and to this end, applaud the CSOs’ measured and analytical approach to identifying weaknesses and recommending changes. We thank them for advancing many recommendations that made it to the Sexual Harassment Act and for continuing to advocate for amendments to the Domestic Violence Act, Child Care and Protection Act and other pieces of legislation that protect our women and children from violent and predatory actions.-UNDP will focus on vulnerable groups in 2022
-2022 will be the year that UNDP consolidates new projects and initiatives to help lift more persons out of poverty by supporting resilient, risk-informed recovery and growth, the human rights of marginalized groups and a more sustainable and nature-based approach to development. This is outlined in our new Country Programme covering the 2022 to 2026 period.  To this end we have also started the process of mobilizing partnerships to address vulnerabilities uncovered by the socio-economic impact assessment and MVI within the scope our corporate mission.-Lessons we can convert into reslience and growth opportunities-Based on the lessons learned from our people and partners, I would like to offer a few recommendations for consideration:-1.       Let’s map the status of Jamaica’s digital transformation with the aim of accelerating transition to a digital society. UNDP’s Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA) tool, most recently used in Grenada, can help.-2.       Let’s target vulnerabilities with greater precision. UNDP stands ready to deploy the MVI on request, but also recommend a Data Hub and Policy Lab platform to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of a wide range of programmes designed to reduce vulnerability of identified groups.-3.       Let’s undertake mobile registration and engagement of hard-hit vulnerable groups identified in many studies including the UNDP/SALISES/CAPRI study to facilitate automatic identification and tailored support in a more targeted and seamless manner.-4.       Let’s focus COVID recovery on a more sustainable pathway by maximizing the blue and green economies with innovative nature-based and green solutions, while ensuring that everyone benefits and participates fully from development gains.-5.       Let’s consider implementing a Knowledge Sharing and Empowerment Network on peace, crime prevention and citizen safety and security for youth organizations. The network could serve to systematize best practices in youth-led community-based crime prevention methods and provide mentorship, resources, crime prevention micro grant funding and other opportunities.-6.       Let’s continue the pace of legislative overhaul so ably piloted by the Ministry of Gender, Culture, Entertainment and Sports to save our girls and women from the scourge of violence.-Resilient recovery from COVID-19 requires reliable data offering layers of insight, quickly accessible to policy makers to drive targeted responses. Further, our collective efforts for a sustainable future are best served by supporting the most vulnerable among us and ensuring they get the help they need to reduce those vulnerabilities. Finally, we must emancipate ourselves from unsustainable development models and fully embrace environmentally sustainable pathways to development. We commend this as a viable pathway to growth and resilience and assure you that UNDP remains your willing partner in this process.- -Denise E Antonio is UNDP Resident Representative to Jamaica, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands.

The national gasp of shock and dismay lasts as long as the next news cycle.-The reality is child sexual violence is far too often facilitated by myths and misconceptions that have been normalized by many of our communities and families. These myths create a comfort zone for the predator and diminish the strength of the legal protection from sexual violence that children ought to enjoy. Some of the common myths that enable sexual abuse are:-These norms persist, defying the relatively robust legal framework established to protect children from sexual violence. This helps to account for the approximately 2000 to 3000 reports of sexual abuse received by the National Children’s Registry every year. Almost 10,000 cases of child abuse were reported in 2020; 20 per cent or approximately 2481 were cases of child sexual abuse. The year 2021 is on pace to match 2020.  From January to June 2021, there were 1,203 reports of sexual abuse of children.-We are in a silent state of emergency and not only because the data is sobering, but because the myths are not yielding to the law.  -The local legal framework for the protection of children is bulwarked by multifaceted laws: The Sexual Offences Act makes it unlawful to have sex with anyone under the age of 16 as well as to have incestuous sexual relations with any child who is a near relative. It is supported by other laws that prohibit child pornography, child trafficking or the employment of children in potentially exploitative places such as nightclubs or bars. Additionally, the Child Care and Protection Act (CCPA) requires persons – particularly those who work with children – to make a report to the National Children’s Registry every time they know or suspect that a child may be the victim of sexual or other abuse or neglect.-We must strengthen the law-Further strengthening is now in order. There are aspects of our laws that should be urgently upgraded to address sexual violence against minors more directly. For example, offences such as incest, buggery and sexual intercourse with a minor are the same whether the offender is an adult or another child. This means that the same punishment – and sentence – that is used where the two parties are close in age will apply to adult offenders. This can often result in sentences that are way too low for the nature of the crime. By identifying separate offences, the law can be adjusted to increase penalties for adults, particularly parents, guardians and persons occupying a position of trust, who treat children as sexual prey.-We can also do more by expanding the categories of those legally obligated to report observed or suspected cases of abuse. The network of duty-bearers who has special reporting obligations under the CCPA currently includes persons in the health, education and child-care sectors. But we strongly recommend that coaches and community and church leaders ought to be included as well.-Law reform good start, effectivness of the law  required for impact-Law reform is a good start, but concomitant actions are essential to strengthen impact. We must consider a tripartite approach that combines legal reform with strengthening effectiveness of the laws, while tackling the sub-culture through social and behaviour change interventions. We can strengthen the law’s effectiveness by looking at the range of support systems that are in place for early detection and rehabilitation. We need to expand programmes that target sexually abused children for psychosocial intervention and therapeutic care. The opportunity that they present for breaking cycles of violence will remain limited unless the scope of resources is more equally aligned to the scope of the problem. Recent calls to take a fresh look at the utility of our Sexual Offenders’ Registry and the way accused persons are monitored while on bail need to be examined, as do the minimum sentences applicable to all sexual abuse offences.-The increase in the number of children being sexually victimized during the pandemic is a stark reminder of the necessary protective barrier that persons who work with children help to create. Social workers, guidance counsellors and children’s officers have long been identified as having an unrealistic caseload.  More specially trained police and other frontline workers in the security and health sectors will help to make our response systems more child-friendly and trauma-informed, so that no child needs to complain that a report of sexual violation was not taken seriously.-Further, we need to spread the word on children’s rights so that every well-meaning adult becomes an active part of this net of protection surrounding our children. Public education and behaviour change communication programmes must target those communities known for higher levels of incest and sexual abuse. This will require real-time data sharing among police and social support workers so that we can strategically address the entrenched myths and misconceptions that enable perpetrators.-This points to perhaps the most difficult, but the most necessary aspect of our transformation: changing the ingrained mythologies that create a hiding place for predators. To change the narrative, we need new language, with the media fully on board as partners. An adult male who engages in intimate relations with an underaged girl does not have a ‘girlfriend’. He is a predator and a sex offender. The same goes for an adult female initiating a child into sex. This is not a good deed; you are committing a crime, not passing on a life skill. There is never any excuse that diminishes the egregious act of having sex with a minor, even if that minor is already sexually active or inquisitive. No amount of money paid to a child or their family buys the right to have sex with a child.-We are at Red Alert
-A reasonable conclusion, based on the facts, is that we are at a critical point in a major crisis – A Red Alert. Appropriate crisis response is required to destroy the culturally safe spaces and loopholes enabling the predator. We must act now, concurrently tackling culture, law and intervention with decisive urgency. Spotlight Initiative’s Red Alert Roundtable on the child sexual abuse emergency (October 28) underscored the necessity for accelerated action premised on a few ‘must-haves’: We must acknowledge we are in crisis; We must move into protection mode of our children; Responsible men must rise up as visible advocates and model the change we need to see; We must listen to survivors to ensure our interventions make their mark; and We must all do our part.-Sexual violence against children is everybody’s business. If you suspect a child is being abused in any way, you have a duty to call the child abuse hotline at 211. We must act now. Your shock and dismay are no longer enough.- -Tania Chambers is legal consultant to Spotlight Initiative, a global, multi-year partnership between the European Union and the United Nations to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Latin America & the Caribbean,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Sexual and gender-based violence,Blog post"

Instead we have taken the Earth to a dangerous tipping point of possibly no return if we do not significantly change our ways. It is this alarming rate of destruction that has resulted in the clarion call of the United Nations (UN) Secretary General, Antonio Guterres to declare “2021 as the year to reconcile humanity with nature”. The exponential increase in the pressures on the Earth’s resources have also motivated the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the global development network of the UN, to produce a different kind of Human Development Report in 2020, one that takes into account the planetary pressures on human development and offer cogent alternatives embodied in the title of the Report,  “The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene”.-While all countries are being affected by the wanton degradation of the natural environment, small island developing states (SIDS) are disproportionately impacted. One main reason is because they rely heavily on their natural resources for socio-economic survival. For instance, Jamaica is heavily reliant on its natural resources as the critical foundation for economic activities in tourism, mining, agriculture and fishing and many other sectors. The island boasts a rich endowment of biodiversity, partly due to its physical features. The country also has relatively high endemism of plants and animal species ranking 18th in the world in terms of the number of endemic birds and over 900 endemic plant species.-However, we are not taking adequate care of our “Garden of Eden.” Notwithstanding efforts by the Government to protect the country’s biodiversity and to encourage sustainable use of natural resources, Jamaica still grapples with environmental degradation. For example, in 2016 Jamaica ranked 54th out of 180 countries on the University of Yale’s global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) and by 2020 the country slipped 12 places to 66. The country is challenged by degradation of its marine and terrestrial ecosystems, unsustainable use of natural resources, unsustainable agriculture practices, pollution, and inadequate waste management.-As reported by the World Bank, Jamaica has made important strides in macro-economic stability and debt reduction over the last seven years and the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (MOFPS) reported that public debt fell to 96% of GDP in fiscal year 2018/19.  However, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the country, resulting in an overall economic contraction of 10% in calendar year 2020, as stated by the Planning Institute of Jamaica, notably driven by a 70% contraction in the tourist industry. The Minister of Finance has declared that “The economic impact of the pandemic in Jamaica has led to an economic decline without parallel in Jamaica’s history”.-However, it is not all doom and gloom. COVID-19 has severely affected the country, but it also presents a turning point for new ways of doing things, underpinned by a green recovery. With the looming socio-economic challenges, the Government will have to innovatively craft policies to build forward better and accelerate recovery. With enhanced capacity, Jamaica would be well-positioned to implement policy alternatives to maximize the blue and green economies with innovative nature-based and green solutions and ensure that everyone benefits and participates fully from development gains. While there are gaps, Jamaica has relatively robust policy, legislative and institutional frameworks for management of the environment reflected in the country’s aim for sustainable management and use of natural resources outlined under in the Vision 2030 Jamaica: National Development Plan’s Goal 4: Jamaica has a healthy natural environment. .  -With Jamaica’s biodiversity and natural resources fueling its economy, the country should harness its natural capital to advance socio-economic development. However, this must be done in a sustainable way. Catalytic investments in the green and blue economy could help the country realize its economic goals and uplift persons out of poverty. It is known that every U$1 invested in conservation returns about U$4 in economic value over time from natural resource goods and services. The point is that the country should realize benefits from sustainably utilizing its natural resource without overexploitation. This requires strengthening the country’s capacity to implement nature-based solutions and facilitate ecosystems-based sustainable livelihoods. For example, achieving the full potential of tourism requires its diversification. The pandemic has shown us that we have to re-think and enhance our present tourism model. The new tourism model should be more sustainable and inclusive and embrace a shift from mass market to unique market niches characterised by smart, customised travel, higher expenditure rates by tourists, higher valued niche products and reduced impact on the environment. In capitalizing on market trends, the Government could move swiftly to expand cultural tourism, community-based tourism, eco-tourism, business and sports tourism, health and wellness tourism and remote working opportunities for long stay working tourists. The potential of health and wellness tourism remains untapped. The global health and wellness market reached US$3.3 billion in 2020 according to Globenewswire, and remote working, influenced by COVID-19, is a growing market segment. Also, with a robust policy, regulatory and institutional framework for greater access and benefit sharing of its genetic resources, Jamaica could stimulate and facilitate small industries such as the nutraceutical and medicinal industries. The global nutraceutical market was estimated at US$230.9 billion in 2018 according to BCC Research.-Agriculture is another sector that could be diversified and expanded using green solutions to not only increase food security but also generate income and employment. Buttressed by sustainable practices and enhanced value chains, the sector offers much for Jamaica. More sustainable practices such as controlled aquaculture, mariculture, permaculture, horticulture, hydroponics and aquaponics should be encouraged. Both hydroponics and aquaponics enables the soil-less growth of plants thus reducing the impact on the environment. Aquaponics combines growing plants hydroponically and raising fish. The global hydroponics market was estimated at US$9.5 billion in 2020 by Markets and Markets. Sustainable agriculture requires managing systems and landscapes; hence, landscape management and land use planning are essential.-Along Jamaica’s coastal areas additional opportunities abound and should be viewed as pivotal to socio-economic development. More than 50% of economic assets and about 70% of the population are concentrated in these areas which are highly vulnerable to natural hazards. Healthy coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs are integral to protection of the island’s physical and economic assets and should be supported as a critical component of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to the impacts of climate change. In addition, the coastal zone offers opportunities for mariculture, diversification in fisheries and expansion in other blue economy sectors such as the marine biotechnology.-Our natural capital offers a solid avenue to economic prosperity and social well-being. However, these benefits can only be realized if we integrate biodiversity management and sustainable use of natural resources into all that we do from the policy level to ground level, from the policy-makers to the users of the resources. This is not only the responsibility of Government but is a duty that should be shared by all Jamaicans. The policy prescriptions must not be confined to paper but should be actively translated into practical solutions through diverse partnerships to transform the lives of Jamaicans. The time is now, the opportunities abound. Environmental management is a priority of the Government.

It is virtually impossible for us to overstate the value of the bee in preserving biodiversity while sustaining livelihoods. Bees are vital parts of a life cycle that sustain our food security as most crops, including vegetables, are pollinated by honeybees.  In some cases, the establishment and operation of apiaries has helped to transform the lives of people, by  providing a good source of income, while increasing awareness of the importance of natural resources and their role in preserving our environment for present and future generations.-In Jamaica, beekeeping is a very old practice that has been passed through generations and has been well-established in virtually all parishes. Through the work of UNDP’s GEF Small Grants Programme which supports beekeeping in pursuit of poverty reduction through a nature based approach to development, we are committed to strengthening this traditional livelihood recognizing that it helps to diversify local economies and feeds families in rural communities.- -Over a ten-year period spanning 2009 to 2019, the UNDP implemented GEF Small Grants Programme has supported the bee keeping industry at the community level with training, equipment and knowledge exchanges to the tune of USD372,635 – the equivalent of JMD $56.6 Million.  Having garnered significant experience in supporting beekeeping, UNDP/GEF SGP agrees there is still much work to be done to return to and surpass production levels in previous years, in order to boost the contribution of bee keeping to economic growth and job creation.  -One of the critical areas to be addressed is capacity building and knowledge management. To this end, research should be an ongoing activity at the national level because too often agricultural initiatives fail due to limited research. Beekeeping has a learning curve which some people tend to ignore before establishing their apiary. It is very important to secure appropriate knowledge of the process and requirements before starting out. Initial knowledge saves time, money and most importantly, helps bees to get stronger. Today, while it is possible to browse valuable knowledge products online, key resources remain inaccessible for many local and vulnerable communities whose best means of survival is beekeeping.-Having in-depth knowledge of beekeeping is a good start, but it is not just about establishing an apiary as one of UNDP GEF/SGP’s latest grantees, the Sawyers Local Forest Management Committee Benevolent Society would tell you. Learning both the theory and practical areas of bee keeping is the ideal. The Apiary unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has been working with most of our local communities in terms of offering training, but the current gap, which is knowing the theory on beekeeping and important role the environment plays, needs to be adequately addressed. For example, training with Sawyers LFMC included sessions on bee caring (understanding the queen, knowing when to split, when to visit the hives etc.) and apiary management (location of apiary, what equipment to purchase and how to use them, movement around the apiary etc.). This group also addressed means of expanding the operations of the apiary to include new members of the community, sharing their practical experiences, and in addition, is committed to maintaining the forested areas.-The development of simple reference guides in multimedia formats for new bee farmers could also be useful. For the sustainability of apiculture, more focus should be placed on learning/training while linking the important role of the natural resources which the bees depend on. While this is accessible through private operators and a few government agencies, this should be incorporated into the agriculture curriculum in schools to ensure sound knowledge of the theory of beekeeping. This could be the best medium to bring greater awareness and youth involvement to this industry, while on the other hand, awareness sessions on the many by-products and their benefits could be established at the national level.- -Another concern is the location to set up an apiary. A forested area is more ideal but uncertainties and conflicts over land ownership has always been a problem for the local communities, especially those in the areas designated as Protected Areas. We believe that bee farmers who operate within forest reserves should be able to own these lands and or have co-management arrangements with the Government to better support these nature-based initiatives that are more sustainable and environmentally-friendly and by extension, boost our economic growth.-While investing in beekeeping takes time and can be challenging, it is a worthwhile venture that offers not only honey, but viable by-products, such as bee pollen, beeswax. This strikes an uncommon balance between natural resource preservation and livelihoods, while the development of markets and certification of products can lead to greater impact. On the occasion of World Bee Day and this year’s planned launch of the Decade on Ecosystem Conservation, it is an opportune time for us to learn more about the critical role of the mighty bee and their impact on biodiversity and local contributions to sustainable development. UNDP/GEF SGP lauds the Government of Jamaica for a step in the right direction regarding their initiative to support the beekeeping industry with the allocation of JMD $35Million towards capacity building interventions for bee farmers.-With the restriction of honey import to Jamaica, every effort should be made to ensure that the local industry is a vibrant, productive and sustainable one. As such, proper monitoring systems should be in place to ensure certification of the practices and quality of products available to consumers. Beekeeping is one of those rare instances where humans and environment can co-exist. This is undeniably a win-win and a major plus for national development aspirations. UNDP/GEF SGP remains committed to supporting Jamaica in this journey. Happy World Bee Day.- -Hyacinth Douglas is the UNDP/GEF Small Grants Programme National Coordinator for Jamaica, and Leonie Barnaby is Chair of the of the GEF SGP National Steering Committee in Jamaica.

More formally, Psychological Safety is ""being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career.""

Consider the experiences under which many women work globally. According to the UN “Women stand at the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, as health care workers, caregivers, innovators, community organizers and as some of the most exemplary and effective national leaders in combating the pandemic. The crisis has highlighted both the centrality of their contributions and the disproportionate burdens that women carry.”

The 2020 McKinsey report underscores this point within the US context: Women in particular have been negatively impacted. Women—especially women of color—are more likely to have been laid off or furloughed during the COVID-19 crisis, stalling their careers and jeopardizing their financial security. The pandemic has intensified challenges that women already faced. Working mothers have always worked a “double shift”—a full day of work, followed by hours spent caring for children and doing household labor. Now the supports that made this possible—including school and childcare—have been upended. Meanwhile, Black women already faced more barriers to advancement than most other employees. Today they’re also coping with the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the Black community. And the emotional toll of repeated instances of racial violence falls heavily on their shoulders.

As it relates to underrepresentation of women In the US Context, the Mckinsey report highlighted a modest 4 % increase in the number of women represented in the C-Suite between 2015 and 2020.

When we enter the social spaces within which we work we perform threat analyses. Where we assess the space as being safe, there is a positive performance response. Where we deem the space to be unsafe, a defensive mode is often triggered and this can lead to a survival response. This leads to cognitive impairment, which has a negative impact on performance.-Ultimately, the defensive mode leads to the loss of human capital contribution and this is why psychological safety is not just a fancy framework but a powerful and practical tool for increasing team performance, employee retention and innovation. Think about it personally. What has your response been in the face of negative social situations such as facing negative stereotypes, being punished for an honest mistake or having someone else take credit for your work?

As emotional creatures, these experiences trigger pain centers in the brain in the same way that physical pain does.

I outline below the 4 stages of Psychological Safety as put forward by Dr. Timothy Clark. I encourage you to reflect on the status quo within your own team especially through the lens of women, and the layers of challenges they often face.

Inclusion Safety: When there is Inclusion safety, a team member feels included. Inclusion is a human right. There is an inherent worthiness in each member of the human race. Creating Inclusion safety requires teams and team leaders to notice and value each member for their being.

Learner Safety: When there is Learner Safety, a team member feels safe to learn, ask questions, give and receive feedback, experiment and make mistakes. When work cultures do not support learner safety, team members operate in defense mode, focusing on self-preservation and self-protection. This disrupts the learning process.

We all bring some anxiety into learning spaces To the extent that a team can work to disconnect failure and mistakes from fear, they can vastly improve learning experiences.-Contributor Safety: The safety to contribute. When there is contributor safety, the team is given autonomy and accountability in exchange for results. To the extent that a leader can create contributor safety, a feeling of self-efficacy is developed within team members. In many cases women’s contributions are suppressed or taken without reciprocal acknowledgement. Leaders and influencers can act to shift cultures like this by first being honest in accepting the reality and then by employing intentional strategies such as those listed in this article.

Challenger Safety: The safety to challenge the status quo. At this highest level of risk and vulnerability, dissent is rewarded. Intellectual bravery and creative abrasion are welcomed and actively encouraged. When arguments can be discussed on their merit and not on the assigned or perceived merit of the person proposing the argument, true innovation can emerge. In effect challenger safety is a license to innovate.

Redesigning Culture

It’s imperative that Culture be aligned for psychological safety of all, especially for women and those who have minoritized identities.

The good news is that culture is a designable asset.

Based on the Culture Formation Hypothesis, the most important factor in the formation of culture is the modeling behaviour of the Leader.

The current global crisis offers a rare opportunity to tackle the mammoth task of culture re-design. As Dr. Timothy Clark eloquently states “Crisis liquefies the status quo.” So Leaders, you have the chance to recast your organization and team cultures right in this moment.-
Here are some practical tools:

Using Basic Regard-Call persons by their names. If you choose to shorten or edit their names for your own comfort and preferences, that behaviour acts to oppose Inclusion Safety.
Notice persons and let them know that you see them. Notice their absence. Make reference to it. Reflect on whether or not you see the inclusion of ALL members of your team as a human right. If you have any qualifiers or ranking for inclusion, be courageous in exploring those more deeply. There are biases at play.

Show your team that you are engaged-Being present can be communicated by attending behaviour such as maintaining eye contact, limiting distractions when team members speak to you, and practicing active listening. Listening is a powerful tool especially when used to understand others and their perspectives. Seek first to understand and then to be understood.

In virtual context, where routine and rote are commonplace try to dispense with the superficialities. Encourage the team to respond authentically to the hackneyed question of “How are you?” A simple question of “Is that how you are really doing?” can have a profound impact on communication authentic engagement. Also, as we are connecting virtually as often as we do try paying closer attention to the non-verbal and body language cues and use video and voice as often as possible.

Minimize Blaming-Lead with curiosity vs blame. Use collaborative language and adopt a learning mindset. Instead of stating “you keep making this mistake” ask “how can we ensure this does not happen again?” or “what do you think needs to happen here?”

Model Self-Awareness & accountability-This includes owning your unique preferences, conflict styles and how you work best. Encourage your team members to do the same. This helps to flatten the culture. It sends a strong message of inclusivity.

This also includes being open to feedback. Your team should feel able to raise objections to your ideas and actions where they are due. In a psychologically safe team, a leader encourages intellectual and creative friction. Especially if your team is in the business of producing, cultivating challenger safety is paramount for driving the innovation needed to thrive.

Ask for feedback when you give feedback-A thoughtful question such as “How could I have shared that more effectively?” can go a long way in building trust and vulnerability.

 Build empathy into your communication-Especially in dealing with team members who have identities different from your own, use the following reflections:

-This person is balancing a lot in this pandemic just like me
-This person has goals and dreams just like me
- This person has insecurities just like me

Celebrate Intellectual Bravery-
Intellectual bravery is the willingness to disagree. Being disagreed with may feel uncomfortable at first but be mindful of the difference between dissent and disrespect. Avoid lumping the two things. For women of colour in particular, feeling safe to challenge can be a difficult thing. There is a sort of catch-22 wherein if women of colour do speak up they can be characterized as aggressive. As a leader or influencer be mindful of helping team members to challenge their own biases and create space for women’s voices.

Model Vulnerability-
Especially when navigating new learnings, fear of looking inept can be high for some team members. Leaders and influencers can create Learner safety by sharing vulnerably about a recent failure they had. Asking everyone to teach can also aid in increasing safety.

 Avoid Micromanaging by using the following guide:-
A. Explain the Why.
B. Assign the What.
C. Delegate the How.
D. Recognize contributions-Create a culture of allyship-Women, specifically women of colour and trans-women, often experience significant stress and anxiety in work spaces. If you have privilege you can become an ally for greater inclusion and representation for minortized bodies and voices. We all have privilege. I encourage you to be intentional in amplifying the voices of those less privileged based on their race, non-immigrant status, age, gender, language, size, sexual identity, country of origin or neurotypical status.

- -The work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) takes me and my team to boardrooms and ball fields; to powerbrokers at the pinnacle of policymaking, to unsung heroes influencing change in marginalized communities. Now, when I walk into a room, I am more conscious that among the women and girls I rub shoulders with, are those who have been, or are likely to be, abused by a  partner.-From the hills to the inner cities, violence against women and girls (VAWG) is no respecter of class, colour, creed or political affiliation. It diminishes mental, physical and emotional health and productivity across all barriers, while holding the power to undermine families, communities and national development aspirations. Heightened awareness of these simple facts in our day to day engagements, is a powerful reminder that violence is not a distant problem because me and mine are fine. Violence against even one spells compounded negative impacts to us all.-The data tells one part of the tale: Jamaica has a high prevalence rate of 27.8 per cent or 1 in every 4 women in Jamaica have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime, according to  the first national survey on gender-based violence in Jamaica 2016. The data confirms higher prevalence of physical and sexual violence experienced by women in urban areas and that women 18 years and younger when they entered their first union, are twice as likely to experience severe violence compared to older women.  The high incidence of violence against women and children, especially girls remains a major obstacle to the achievement of gender equality, the empowerment of women, and national development.-As UNDP and other UN agencies work under the leadership of the Government of Jamaica and the European Union funded Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls, we recognize that we must strengthen the evidence base by engaging the people who experience these lived realities, and those whom they trust and work with. We must work with civil society on applying this dynamic body of evidence to fix the legislative and policy framework, thereby restraining perpetrators from their worst inclinations, convicting those who break the law, and offering victims significant recourse to justice.  -A sound legislative and policy environment must form part of an evidence-based holistic approach to address the discriminatory gender power dynamics within families and society that adversely impact women and girls.  Through the Spotlight Initiative, UNDP is working with the Gender and Development Studies Regional Coordinating Office (IGDSRCO) of the University of the West Indies and hardworking members of civil society in support of Legislative Reform to Eliminate Violence Against Women and Girls. We commend and continue to partner with the Government of Jamaica on efforts being made to strengthen key pieces of legislation including the Sexual Offences Act, the Offences Against Persons Act, Domestic Violence Act, Child Care and Protection Act and the Sexual Harassment Act.  -Spotlight Initiative assessments conclude that while Jamaica has a strong local legislative and policy framework addressing family violence and gender-based violence, implementation is lagging and there still remain significant legislative and regulatory gaps. The regulatory framework for domestic violence is a case in point.-Spotlight Initiative research found that available remedies for victims under the Domestic Violence Act were inadequately enforced and that victims had no immediate relief if Orders made under this Act were being breached. Recommendations for a specific definition of Domestic Violence, expansion of the categories of persons who can apply for a Protection Order on behalf of a victim of abuse and the need for the establishment of a Joint Select Committee of Parliament to consider comprehensive changes are indeed timely.-Similar to the previous acts, clauses in the Sexual Offences Act, Offences Against the Person Act, and the Childcare and Protection Act are not expansive enough to fully protect our vulnerable population. Additionally, there are vague definitions and omissions which could allow for misinterpretations which enables harmful acts or for willful circumvention of the law.-We are particularly hopeful for a groundbreaking Sexual Harassment Act as these acts of aggression are gateways to more violent acts of GBV. Our Spotlight team made a comprehensive presentation of recommendations to the Joint Select Committee of Parliament with a view to strengthening its provisions. We called for: Including children’s homes, faith community, Sports Programmes, Clubs or Teams and their Facilities to be explicitly included under the definition and scope of institutions covered by the Bill; defining the work environment so it explicitly covers informal work environments and casual labour; expanding the range of persons protected (workers and residents) to also include clients, customers, beneficiaries, visitors and other users of a workplace or institution; expanding definition of public and community spaces to include community centres, parks, sporting facilities, public transportation hubs, youth and community development facilities and facilities run by non-governmental and charitable organizations. Our submission also called for removing the requirement for consent in relation to a child victim; including a Child Psychologist and/or other Paediatric Expert in the Tribunal; and a 6-year time limit for submitting a complaint. The experts advise us that there are many psycho-social reasons why a delay in reporting may occur including the age and developmental capacity of the complainant at the time of the incident, or their ignorance of the protection provided by the law. We believe a fit for purpose Sexual Harassment Act can be foundational to addressing VAWG before it escalates into more violent acts. That is why we urge the Government to consider a robust resocialization public education programme that changes notions of gender power dynamics.-Concomitant policy work will also be required to reinforce the protective environment. To this end Spotlight will review and update the 2011 National Policy on Gender Equality to ensure alignment with the National Strategic Action Plan on GBV and other relevant policies and legislation.-These snapshots of our ongoing analysis and contributions to legal and policy reform with respect to VAWG underscores that a multi-level, multi-sectoral approach that hinges on key partnerships among a variety of stakeholders is crucial.  The interventions under the SI reflect the collaboration between UNDP, UN Women, UNFPA and UNICEF to advocate for legislative and policy reforms, and a network of Civil Society Organizations (CSO) who are being supported and empowered to support the legislative reform process. We recognize that the flexibility, dynamism, and ability of CSOs to connect with and represent local, community and at-risk groups are essential to ensure that policy and legislation and development planning frameworks meet the requirements of the target groups and the general population.  We also recognize that we need Parliamentarians to seize the vision and to become allies in advancing the necessary amendments and resource allocations.-Our preliminary assessments tell us that we must apply key lessons learnt in forging the way forward. We must strengthen laws to be more evidenced-based and gender-responsive; eliminate discriminatory dispositions and implicit bias in existing legislation - including in criminal proceedings and sentencing, and ensure adequate resources are allocated to support effective implementation of legislation and policies.-By strengthening policy and legal frameworks through dynamic engagement with those who know the issues intimately, we are confident that together we can contribute to more comprehensive protection of the most vulnerable - particularly women and girls, decrease levels of discrimination and foster an environment conducive to the elimination of family violence.  - ","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,Blog post,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities"

Kingston 21 January 2021 – 2020 was a year of great testing, reflection and recalibration for all of us, due in large part to a global pandemic that redefined all we knew about crisis response and management.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Multi Country Office in Jamaica saw how COVID 19 threatened to derail the targets we had meticulously set in partnership with the government and people of Jamaica, and more so, to impact lives and livelihoods while overturning national development gains –  in just weeks.  This is the nature of crisis after all, but never had we imagined the scale of the disruption. The setbacks surprised us, but it also dared us, challenged us to be agile in finding ‘work arounds’ and other viable solutions to support Jamaica in this time of crisis and to give more weight to crisis prevention and recovery in our future programming.-Like every development partner, we were impacted, concerned, cognizant of the need for unprecedented creativity and innovation, powered by teamwork.-In consultation with Government we reset our priorities and work modalities with the aim of sustaining our support to Jamaica’s national development aspirations as well as Bahamas’ ongoing hurricane recovery programme. Technology became the backbone of our operations: We implemented unprecedented tele working arrangements, leveraging digital software and hardware to connect our staff in a virtual office space. Meanwhile, we met virtually with government and other partners to determine their most urgent COVID 19 response and recovery needs. We got to work mobilizing resources from UNDP core funds and repurposing project funds with the kind permission of donors like the European Union and Global Affairs Canada. We revised implementation methodologies, fast tracked activities that did not require physical interactions and extended projects where necessary due to inevitable implementation lags.-Our resulting package of COVID19 response projects and services were designed to make a modest contribution to containing the economic fallout as well as disruption in basic social services experienced due to the pandemic. To this end we scaled up existing initiatives led by the Government in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations to reinforce the social safety nets of the country.  These efforts included the provision of relief packages containing food and sanitation items to low-income female headed households; income replacement grants to household workers and business stimulation grants to Micro Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs). UNDP also supported government in bolstering its capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by rolling out the pilot phase of a digital platform designed to coordinate, monitor and track local and international support in times of emergency. Given the evolving development challenges experienced from COVID-19, continued emphasis will be placed on strengthening national institutions to deliver basic services and social protection to the most vulnerable as well as to monitor environmental issues.-Our COVID crisis support also extended to economic policy advisory knowledge management services. Leveraging our global knowledge network and local expertise, UNDP produced policy papers featuring robust analysis of the response to the COVID-19 health crisis and its economic and social impacts on Jamaica and The Bahamas, while offering tailored policy prescriptions for consideration.-Essentially, crisis forecasting, prevention and recovery became a cornerstone of our policy response and support. It was always a feature of our project portfolio, never its bedrock. COVID 19 changes everything.-Other aspects of our crisis portfolio focused on hurricanes and Climate Change. In 2020, UNDP’s support to The Bahamas was tailored to build resilience in the wake of the category five hurricane Dorian the previous year. In 2020 we strengthened our partnership with the Government of The Bahamas to enhance its institutional capacity to build resilience to climate change and natural disasters through the approval National Recovery Policy and Implementation Plan by the Cabinet and production and distribution of a “Build to Code” manual. UNDP is particularly proud of the Caribbean region's first mobile Technical Assistance Centres which have been deployed to Abaco and Grand Bahama to provide door to door hurricane resilient home repair and advice services to homeowners impacted by Hurricane Dorian. A Cash-for-Work Programme provided emergency livelihood support to the most vulnerable while helping in the post hurricane cleanup of select places on the islands.-Through the completion of the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the Water Sector Policy, the capacity of Jamaica’s Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation has been strengthened to bolster resilience against climate shocks and to safeguard  the vulnerable against preventable waterborne and sanitation-related diseases.-There was progress in other areas of our portfolio, notwithstanding the crisis, but also due in large part to the agility of our response and the efficient deployment of technology. For example, Jamaica made further progress in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2020, with UNDP support by building capacity to monitor progress of implementation efforts and also building capacity to leverage innovative financing mechanisms for further localization of the SDG.-Notably, the capacities of public-policy and rule-of-law institutions and civil society organizations to advance human rights and justice sector reform were strengthened. This included strengthening the  technical capacity of human rights and civil society institutions in legal reform efforts and improving access to legal information and services by operationalization of two legal mobile units, the development of justice related Information Education and Communication materials, and an interactive portal for justice sector users.   -UNDP continued is support to Jamaica’s policy framework for natural resources management by supporting development and approval of the Minerals Policy in 2020.  Our environmental and climate change portfolio continued to be robust in 2020 despite the challenges as we supported strengthening local capacity to fulfil obligations under international conventions and the development of national implementation plans.-Additionally, we supported targeted interventions designed to impact Jamaica’s public sector energy bill through the introduction of renewable energy and installation of energy efficiency technologies at four health facilities, consistent with Jamaica’s national energy security and efficiency goals.-I take my hat off to a great team and great partners. I wish to thank the Governments and people of Jamaica and The Bahamas for their continued leadership and accessibility as we seek to better the lives of our people consistent with national development priorities. We especially thank our donor partners, the European Union and Global Affairs Canada for their support in reallocating funds under UNDP implemented projects to COVID response and recovery. Finally, a big thank you to Team UNDP for tirelessly working to bring agility and responsiveness to UNDP’s interventions in 2020.-Though fraught with challenges, 2020 has taught all of us enduring lessons:-1.      We must be more serious about strengthening crisis response and prevention, ensuring adequate forecasting, capacity building, planning and mitigation. Crisis is inevitable, differing only in scope and impact. We must be more prepared-2.      We fully support efforts to advance the digital society and economy and call for greater levels of investment in supporting infrastructure, training and policies to enable this sooner rather than later. By enabling digital tools and resources and migrating many functions into these spaces, UNDP has been able to continue its support of the government and people of Bahamas and Jamaica.-3.      Policies must be agile in responding to crisis. Emergency safeguards must empower people to act quickly and decisively when required while adhering to sound principles of fairness and transparency. UNDP’s global policy amendments in response to the pandemic, enabled our field offices to mobilize quickly and efficiently to support the countries we serve.-Going forward UNDP Multi Country Office in Jamaica renews its commitment to strengthening capacities for crisis prevention response and recovery and technology transfer and adaptation, bringing greater levels of responsiveness and agility to our support, especially when crisis knocks. These are crucial next steps as we recalibrate for a future that may hold unpleasant surprises in store. We must be ready.-Denise E Antonio is UNDP Resident Representative to Jamaica, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands.

For too long, women and some men too, have silently suffered the indignity of sexual harassment because of an unwritten code that gives a cultural pass to offensive actions.-Unwanted catcalls, touches, crude and degrading statements, taking advantage of unequal power dynamics foster unsafe and toxic environments resulting in unhappy and unhealthy people.  Sexual Harassment is an assault on the dignity, productivity and career prospects of both women and men. It imposes a personal, professional and mental cost on victims and a reputational and productive cost on organizations. I will go further to even say that Sexual Harassment is on the spectrum of gender-based violence, one that expresses verbal, non-verbal and physical aggression towards its intended victims, leaving behind battle scars associated with violence.-Research conducted at the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 confirms that women who experienced sexual harassment had almost a 3 times higher risk of developing depressive symptoms. They also experienced debilitating stress reactions, sleep disorders, high blood pressure, and lowered self-esteem, and nausea.-Sexual Harassment is not just a human rights issue. It touches on wellbeing, health and productivity. We must tackle it decisively. That is why the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Multi Country Office in Jamaica is proud to be a part of the team of United Nations agencies in Jamaica partnering with government and civil society to implement the European Union-funded Spotlight Initiative, a global, multi-year partnership between the European Union and the United Nations to eliminate all forms of violence against all with particular focus on women and girls. Under the leadership of the government we intend to support and advocate for strengthening relevant legislations that safeguards all from acts of violence.-Government’s enabling actions with respect to the draft Sexual Harassment Act, currently before the Joint Select Committee of Parliament, is a bold step in the right direction. We heartily commend their unwavering commitment and urge us all to remain invested in ensuring Jamaica passes the best possible fit for purpose legislation that is responsive and accessible to victims.-Once this law is passed, Jamaica will join the company of about 140 countries to date which have laws on sexual harassment, according to the Women, Business and the Law 2020 publication. But ending the trauma of sexual harassment does not end with the passage of the law. We must engage in a continuous process of public education and advocacy to inform people of their rights and to inform them about the institutional arrangements designed to investigate and adjudicate on cases of sexual harassment.-Jamaica can also strengthen its bold legislative step by ratifying the Violence and Harassment Convention 2019, applicable to places of work. The tone of Article 4 is instructive as it obliges nations to adopt ""an inclusive, integrated and gender-responsive approach for the prevention and elimination of violence and harassment in the world of work”. Notably, Jamaica’s draft Act contains provisions that are largely in step with the provisions of Article 4, with the Jamaica law being applied more widely than the convention to also include schools, colleges, universities, places of safety, nursing homes and correctional institutions. -Recognizing the serious nature of sexual harassment and its impact on the workforce, UNDP has developed a worker-centric and centred Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority that is compliant with the principles of the Violence and Harassment Convention 2019. Some of the key takeaways in the UNDP policy are as follows:-The UNDP Multi Country Office in Jamaica welcomes the opportunity to share further insights from our policy with interested organizations. Let us keep the exchanges flowing.  We must seize the opportunity not only during this period of the global commemoration of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence, but 365 days to let our voices be heard, and more importantly, to be strategic and thoughtful. Through the Spotlight Initiative we hope you will count on us as your partner in this journey.  - -Denise E Antonio is the United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative for Jamaica, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands.

Kingston 7 August 2020 – A global 19th century tradition of packing stones into wire baskets, then stacking these baskets into unsteady hillsides has been routinely proven to stabilize landslide-prone areas, saving lives, livelihoods and housing stock right here in 21st century Jamaica. The gabion wall or basket as it is called, is symbolic of how actions to bolster climate change adaptation and mitigation is most powerful when members of the community are involved and tried and proven traditional knowledge is employed.-The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Multi Country Office in Jamaica, through its Small Grants Programme has effectively deployed the gabion wall technique in several communities in Jamaica and imparted valuable gabion wall-making skills that can be called on when necessary to further bolster the community’s resilience to the impacts of climate change. Wordsworth Gordon of Jeffrey Town Farmers Association in St Mary told us of a day when gabion walls installed in the community saved several houses from certain destruction following heavy rains. These and similar strategies at the community levels offer plenty options for strengthening community resilience as Jamaica faces increasingly frequent and powerful storms and hurricanes with potentially devasting impact. Jamaica’s vulnerability to hurricanes is underscored by a  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development case study which described Jamaica as being located in the “hurricane alley” of the Atlantic, featuring  large population concentrations and infrastructure located in narrow coastal areas; and high dependency on natural resources.  A 2012 Socio-economic and Environmental Disaster Impact Assessment concluded that between 2001 and 2010, Jamaica had been impacted by 10 disaster events, resulting in $111.81 billion in losses, and a new World Bank Report, ‘Advancing Disaster Risk Finance in Jamaica’ is suggesting that, on average, Jamaica would need $16 billion annually to cover losses from natural disasters. Of this amount, it is estimated that $9 billion would be required to address hurricane damage to public and private buildings.-Significant socio-economic and environmental challenges caused by Climate Change.-UNDP’S climate action Portfolio in Jamaica has largely been shaped by these facts and other data pointing to other significant socio-economic and environmental challenges caused by Climate Change.  Severe Climate Change impacts on rural communities, such as drought, has curtailed access to potable water, impacting food production, income and poverty. Jamaica's Social and Economic Survey 2018 indicates that average annual rainfall in Jamaica is below the 30-year mean for most parishes, with 20 more incidents of normal drought and eight more incidences of severe drought than the previous year (). Coral reef health – needed to reinforce coastal defence, support livelihoods, seafood supplies and beach regeneration can be threatened by rising sea temperatures, impacting seafood supplies to local markets.-20 years of support to Climate Action-UNDP has long recognized that the natural assets of the earth will sustain our livelihoods, food security and wider development ambitions for generations to come, if we treat them with respect, recognizing their value and their inherent vulnerabilities.  Over a period of 20 years, UNDP has been honoured to support a range of Climate Change adaptation and mitigation measures in Jamaica implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation and its Climate Change Division, and the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA), as well as community groups and individuals across the span of Jamaica.-These measures have had multiple benefits, salient of which is enhancing the country’s resilience to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. The measures have also helped to integrate climate change imperatives into development planning at the national, local and community levels.  Jamaica is a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. As such, UNDP’s support for Jamaica’s international reporting commitments under relevant conventions, for example, plays a crucial role in assessing Jamaica’s progress in implementing interventions to reduce the impacts of climate change.  In partnership with NEPA, UNDP has also supported Jamaica’s policy and programme activities under the Montreal Protocol and the Kigali Amendment which targets the reduction and elimination of ozone harming substances.-UNDP works at two levels to support the advancement of Jamaica’s climate change agenda. We provide technical expertise and guidance in mainstreaming climate change at the policy level, but we also work at the community level where upstream policies are translated into downstream actions. We work with community-based organizations and others on the frontline of the most devastating impacts of Climate Change to enhance community resilience, in order to improve the quality of people’s lives.-UNDP’s policy work to advance the Government’s Climate Action agenda has been very gratifying, especially as it relates to our landmark support to the establishment of the Climate Change Division. But it’s our work with communities, that has given us a front row seat to the significant impacts to be achieved when we work in partnership with the people.-At the community levels, UNDP’s mix of projects focuses on building national resilience to Climate Change risks and other potential crises, consistent with sustainable development priorities and promoting other nature-based solutions which empower people to earn from nature without harm to the environment.-Layers of resilience-We have observed, for example, that expanding access to potable water helps to provide another layer of resilience to disaster prone countries like Jamaica. Partnering with communities across Jamaica and with funding from the People of Japan, Australian Aid and through our Small Grants programme, UNDP has been able to expand water storage capacity by a combined 2.2 million gallons over the last seven years. This addition to Jamaica’s storage capacity, while modest by comparison, is notably still serving 135 000 people in 128 communities across Jamaica.  With these investments making additional water available, communities have been able to improve standards of living and livelihoods, strengthen food security, and bolster resilience to disease, drought and other Climate Change impacts.-Clean energy, a win-win for environment and end user, is another area of significant investment for UNDP in Jamaica as we assist the country in meeting its climate change mitigation targets. Utilising UNDP’s core funds, along with resources from the Global Environmental Facility and UNDP’s Small Grants Programme, UNDP has expanded Renewable Energy activities at the community levels in Jamaica, by installing solar systems, training of hundreds in basic LED technology, Solar technology and LED Assembly and Design. With support from the Global Environment Facility, UNDP is currently supporting government in outfitting six public hospitals with renewable energy and energy efficient technology to reduce energy bills.-Our work has taught us a few lessons: That people invested in sustainable livelihoods can become your most avid champions in mitigation and adaptation interventions. Empowered people are sometimes your best lines of defence against the impacts of Climate Change. Partnerships matter, but more than that having a voice and a say makes a bigger difference and shapes more purposeful and impactful interventions. Our community investments are comparatively small, but they demand sweat equity from the communities which helps achieve huge buy in and score major results. Lesson?  Big results do not necessarily need big financial investments. Small Grants can and do invariably pack a bigger punch if well executed and managed.-UNDP lauds the stellar climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts of the Government and communities which are steadily bolstering the country’s resilience. While we celebrate Jamaica’s achievements in Climate Action, we acknowledge that there is much work to be done. UNDP commits to continuing its partnership with Jamaica in support of upstream activities in policy advice, developing the country’s technical and financial capacity to improve social, economic and environmental resilience, and supporting Jamaica’s efforts to continue meeting its international climate action-related obligations. We also intend to deepen and expand our engagement with communities on the frontline of Climate Change, confident that our most powerful lessons and moments are with the people. UNDP remains committed to staying with Jamaica on this journey.- ",['Icon of SDG 13'],"Goal 13  Climate action,Latin America & the Caribbean,News,Blog post"

It is recommended that people avoid crowded places and gatherings to reduce exposure and spread of the virus. In line with this, Lesotho implemented the national lockdown from 30 March 2020 to   ........ During the lockdown, it was almost eerie going through the streets of Maseru; with almost no trace of any human activity. For the first time ever, I was able to make the little corners of the main busstop area and cover the short distance into the CBD in a few minutes. Maseru district hosts almost a quarter of the two million population of Lesotho, and is a major economic hub for the country, providing essential sources of livelihood and employment for almost 326, 688 labour force. -Impact of lockdown on the economy of Lesotho-COVID-19 is expected to have a negative impact on the already weak economy of Lesotho, which according to the Central Bank of Lesotho is expected to decline by 3.1 points. It is also expected that Lesotho is going to experience a further decline in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenue, which makes the bulk of the country’s revenue. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that the SACU member states will lose an estimated 7 billion Rand in a month in customs revenue. Domestic tax collection is also expected to suffer a major blow, due to lockdown that slowed economic activity and businesses. To make matters worse, it is not known how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last. This is creating a new norm where we need to live with the disease and this, if not addressed,  could suggest a longer and worse economic impact on developing countries like Lesotho.-Because of the national lockdown, most sectors that contribute to the GDP of the country are going to suffer. It is already forecasted that the mining, construction and textiles sectors will decline by 13.4%, 10.2% and 14% respectively. Construction and mining companies have already indicated that they are going to limit operation and retrench some of their workers; while the entertainment and tourism sectors will be in limbo for a long while.  Another sector that is set to face economic challenges is the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMMEs) which is predominately composed of informal traders. SMMEs and informal traders make 80% of the domestic private sector and contribute 9.1% to GDP.  Informal traders like many others were not able to operate during the national lockdown. This negatively affected their livelihoods  as most of them survive and feed their households through the incomes generated on day by day selling on the streets of Lesotho. Another challenge with the restricted movement was the inability to replenish stocks from South Africa, as borders were closed for small scale deliveries and Lesotho depends largely on South Africa for most of its basic supplies  and essential goods . Post-lockdown, these traders are going to face dwindling stock levels due to supply chain disruptions and potential lower sales resulting from potential consumer apathy and discrimination based on the perceptions associated with COVID-19 and it how it is transmitted.  These developments are expected to have a significant negative impact on employment and widen the existing inequalities between the rich and poor, urban and rural population, and a resulting disparity in access to various social services. Ultimately, it is expected that the crisis is going to increase the number of unemployed and food insecure people.-Further, despite easing conditions for lockdown, most industries in Lesotho and South Africa will be operating at sub-optimal levels to comply with the requirements for social distancing. This is going to affect households’ incomes, resulting in increased vulnerabilities and pushing more people into the poverty bracket.    -It is not all gloom: could COVID-19 bring about the new normal-The formal sectors and informal sector experienced unprecedented disruption as stores closed; people stayed home, and global supply chains were, disrupted, disconnected or overwhelmed. While many people focused on meeting present challenges, the importance and consideration to the recovery phase of the COVID-19 were initially not taken into consideration as countries were rippling with the effects of COVID-19. Countries are now pondering what “the new norm” may look like for the rich and the poor economies, households, businesses,  public and social services delivery.. The emerging questions that countries are battling with are the short-term and long-term effects of COVID-19 on their economies and livelihoods of their citizens. -Some of the current restrictions imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 are likely to remain in place beyond the lockdown for both developing and developed nations. The social distancing, most likely will stay, and this is expected to affect performance of many economic sectors. For instance, Lesotho has identified tourism as one of the key economic sectors for stimulating domestic economic growth and employment creation. However, with the social distancing, the sector is bound to suffer a major set-back due to travel restrictions within and between countries and changes in consumer behavior.  On the other side, this could also be an opportunity to promote domestic tourism and grow the local tourism offer to take advantage of restrictions for international travel. This will however require innovative solutions to encourage tourism within the Mountain Kingdom.-During the lockdown period we have experienced changes in the way that businesses operate. Beyond the limited trading and operating hours, general hygiene practices were introduced for all operating businesses and essential service providers. Businesses and companies controlled the number of people that could enter the stores and ensured that social distancing remains observed. In addition to social distancing, sanitizers will be a new norm for operating business and maintaining client assurances on hygiene. The post COVID-19 could also impact the way in which businesses serve their clients, by diversifying service offer and pushing technology adaptation. The McKinsey hypothesizes that the COVID-19 will accelerate digital strategies and demand business agility to ensure survival while managing the rising humanitarian crises. In South Africa, certain chain stores encourage customers to purchase and pay for their groceries on-line and collect directly outside the stores to enforce social distancing and decongest shopping centres. This will definitely be part of the new norm, that may also contribute to increased uptake of local delivery services, as consumers get accustomed to ‘staying home’ and minimizing  unnecessary clogging of locations.    -During the lockdown, local small business and informal traders opted to use social media to sell their products as they were not allowed to operate. Due to the limited trading hours for operating shops and reduced movement of people, the digital channels provided an opportunity to move stocks and create a new customer base. For most of the smaller retailers and customers alike, it was the first time using these platforms, especially for the older generation. Post-COVID-19, it is expected that many shoppers will remain with producers and retailers that met their needs during the lockdown period, establishing digital platforms as an alternative shopping experience to the traditional shopping centres and malls. These new relationships built at a critical time of need will influence long-term loyalty and affinity. This also posits opportunities for new business ventures for enterprising youth. Lesotho Accelerator Lab is working with local application developers to create a virtual marketplace to connect local producers/ suppliers to local market.-Lesotho imports 85% of its consumer goods and services from South Africa. Restriction of movements in both countries resulted in a large disruption of local supply chains, and created panic buying among consumers. The lockdown also increased food insecurity among different households with holding of food stuff as prices of basic consumer goods increased. This was seen by the large number of food parcels that have been donated by private companies and individuals. A major lesson from the COVID-19 has been the need to create sustainable local supply for food at national and household level as local demand soared during this time. Besides providing food packages to affected families, people are also finding solutions for promoting long-term household food security and production practices; even those with small household gardens invested more time in growing food crops for their households. The emerging food supply shortages may shift production capacities and standards in the country and open markets for local agricultural produce.  -To become part of the solution, the Lesotho Accelerator Lab is exploring local solutions and innovations addressing the immediate challenges of COVID-19 and creating lessons that may be useful in curating Lesotho’s own “new norm” post-COVID-19.  Among the local solutions being explored, the Lesotho Accelerator is working with youth developer to create an e-commerce platform to assist those that were hard hit by the lockdown and not able to sell their produce/products. Moreover, we are also assisting the Ministry of Health to develop an application that will be used by Village Health Workers and the general public to diagnose suspects of COVID-19 whenever symptoms of the virus are recognized. In partnership with WHO, Ministry of Health, the lab has developed floor stickers which people will stand on when queuing for services in public places to enforce social distancing. In the bus and taxi rank the lab has developed hands-free wash stations which will assist in hand hygiene.- -

The thought process that gave birth to the concept and the personnel within UNDP cannot say precisely what the outcome will be when the concept reaches its maturity stage. In her blog  “What does success look like for UNDP Accelerator Labs? [Part1 of probably many]”, the Team Leader of UNDP Accelerator Labs, Gina Lucarelli, affirms that success of the Accelerator Labs may not be defined in traditional log-frames or results metrices, rather a change in ‘processes and culture necessary for innovation and renewal’.  This means normal attributes which people are accustomed to in measuring the development work may not be perceived throughout the new course of exploration by UNDP.-From experimentation perspective, the Accelerator Lab concept which has currently unfolded for over a year, is anticipated to be validated through reflections on experiments which avail quick evidence-oriented insights. Some of such experiments will be visible as they graduate to scale-up in the form of development projects, business startups, behavioural change within our societies or experiments which unearth evidence influencing policy establishment or change. Within the UNDP and its development partners, additional reflections will be observed from lessons learned out of experiments’ failures which save on possible loss of investments. From this, compiled failure reports and experiments’ artefacts can be referenced as intelligence knowledgebase which directs the approach and execution of the future work within UNDP and externally.-Our approach-The approach and execution of activities within the Accelerator Lab brings a lot of misperception so much that some people believe the Accelerator Lab team is a combination of geniuses with broad cognitive content or better yet – ‘people who know everything’, and supposedly, in fields of mathematics, science and technology. The temporal characteristic required for experimentation also brings more misinterpretation during engagements where colleagues in development work are accustomed to big projects springing across long schedules of implementation before being evaluated for failure or success.-In my early days in Accelerator Lab, I had discussions with a friend who is in a research institution and I was telling him that I must write a blog on my encounters on solutions mapping field trips. His response was “is it a requirement or you are just playing around?” I said, it is a requirement, and it is an integral part of my work where we try to influence engagements for collective intelligence. And he said, “I think UNDP is loosening up”. This was based on how UNDP is perceived by outsiders on its ways of conducting business. People know UNDP as the research hub where academics are hired, and consultants are contracted to execute UNDP’s mandate by producing technical reports and research documents as information resources. No one has ever thought there can be a unit within UNDP which concentrate on the technical aspects of development that is based on local solutions. To add to the mystery, the lab reports and intelligence build-up which relies on social media interactions, blogs, community and individual’s social interactions are queried for validity to make development investment decisions.-Some of the early interactions from social media feed demonstrated skepticism on the approach; questions such as ‘What is this about? Is it really innovative or it is more of the same?’ were asked. The virtue of the Accelerator Lab is in using tested solutions from communities and the global Accelerator Lab counterparts, and interrogating their resilience and scalability through experimentation processes. The observance here excludes normal ways of solutions’ deployment which have been formulated as a result of research, design thinking, or projects designs and implementations.-To experiment or not: the tale of elegant grasshoppers as pesticide-One typical engagement which stood out on social media occurred after a successful solutions-mapping exercise at Kolo region, in the Mafeteng district. This occurred on Facebook where the Lesotho Accelerator Lab posted a pesticide discovery by a maize farmer. On his innovation, the farmer uses a powdered pesticide made from crushed herd of elegant grasshoppers which fed and destroyed crops on his fields. The post stirred mixed feelings and diverse inputs from the Lesotho society.-Some reactions from this post admired this ‘innovation’ as an indigenous knowledge that must be preserved, while others found the idea absurd and detrimental to Lesotho’s ecosystem. Deciding on the next step has been difficult but the team is continuing to explore and collect stakeholder intelligence to inform the next steps for this novel idea that may help many farmers in Lesotho.-Some key lessons from this exchange relate to the evidence basis for the Lab experiments. Social content (blogs, social media, etc.) by the general public is not regarded as a legitimate form of validation of evidence. Formal methods and designs are still seen as trusted ways of coming up with concrete solutions. For the Accelerator Lab, society inputs and intelligence are necessary to validate potential experimentation and facilitate further exploration. Perceptions and interrogations by the society may elevate the challenge of balancing advantages and disadvantages of any identified innovation.-While still exploring options and partners, the following projected hypotheses for possible experimentation have been formulated:-1. If the powdered elegant grasshopper is a pesticide;-- Is it a natural pesticide or the elegant grasshopper has some chemical which can be harmful to crops, ecosystems and soil texture?-- For which crops is the pesticide most applicable?-- Which categories of pests is it mostly appropriate for?-- Is it feasible when scaling up?-2. If it has no elements to categorize it as a pesticide;-- What made pests disappear from the field when it was applied?-- Is there an environmental influence on the disappearance of pests?-- Or was it just a coincidence?-Value add from the Accelerator Lab-Thus far, engagements on the solution were positive, however, more insights are required to shape the experiment design. There is also a believe that this solution may form part of organic pesticides. Some notable issues still requiring further intelligence include sustainability of the solution, social ethics and acceptance in Lesotho. If the Lesotho Accelerator Lab can obtain a commercial solution based on this innovation, there will be more value addition to the Lesotho agricultural sector outcomes on possible organic production practices.-In the meantime, the Lesotho Accelerator Lab will continue to unearth more innovative solutions which can improve livelihoods of people in Lesotho, and more should be expected on the “Elegant Grasshopper Pesticide by a Kolo Farmer”.- -

In the eyes of these young people, they perceive the turmoil as a scary television series depicting end of days and naming it ‘EARTH’ – Episode 2020. They were referring to the apocalypse depicted in a movie called EARTH, where animal mothers struggle to raise their youth in an increasingly dangerous environment; Arctic melting down and the struggle for dryland animals to secure water sources. The basic truth to curbing the rapid spread of the virus has been pointed to hygienic practices from all angles. The spread of this knowledge is a masterwork in interjecting myths and stereotypes such as consuming alcohol, eating raw garlic, avoiding foreigners etc as preventive/curative measures.-According to World Health Organization, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, which was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The coronavirus belongs a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The disease is spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.-While Lesotho still does not have a confirmed case yet,  the threat of the disease on lives and livelihoods looms  is evident  and gets worse closer every day. The challenge is adhering to the WHO guidelines and hygiene standards in joint community spaces to abate the rate of infection. In Lesotho, one of the toughest areas to keep germ-free is the bus-stop area due to population concentration, human and service exchange. It goes without saying that the primary preventive measure to interject transmission is hand hygiene, but the challenge of water and detergents accessibility remains. Who is responsible? This question is a key trigger for innovation and a call for strategic partnerships with all affected communities to reduce chances for contagion and contamination in these areas.-Can we bleach all surfaces?-How do we keep hand hygiene accustomed in our areas? How do we keep our working surfaces clean? These rhetoric questions should be a direct link to how we should keep our communities safe. One would think that the working surfaces should be cleaned every time it has been touched while others are asking how frequent is frequent based on the survival of the virus on different surfaces. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, depending on the environmental conditions. -Maintaining WHO standards in highly populous areas such as the bus-stop may be challenge, due to several factors, including congestion, vicinity of waterpoints and general hygiene requirements. For street vendors, these also include balancing between display of merchandise and cleanliness to attract potential customers. These areas are however seen as potential health hazards and accelerators of the virus. Maseru city hosts almost 1⁄4 of the total population of Lesotho, making it the most population dense and congested place in the whole country.-In view of the disease, it may take a while but it is necessary to retain cleanliness and confidence in the products and services for both customers and sellers, service providers and seekers alike, to restore livelihoods gained in these populated areas In this regard, UNDP Lesotho through the Accelerator Lab has embarked on an innovation aimed at building a culture of cleanliness and to encourage behaviour change among the street, users  dwellers and revellers, and in communities with limited water resources.-A ‘tippy-tap’ as a solution-The Accelerator Lab discovered the ‘tippy-tap’ in Pic 1 below, during a solutions safari in Mafeteng in October 2019. This simple hand hygiene mechanism was seen in different households dangling in front of external lavatories to encourage handwashing after the use of the facilities. It is anticipated that a simple modification and adoption of this for different communities in the urban and rural areas would save lives and livelihoods and promote the new socialisation required  by the COVID19 era.-
-This uses 5-litre containers and has a small hole on the cap which releases water when stepping on the loose string attached to the container. The Accelerator Lab has remodelled this, using the same technology, to address hygiene needs for densely populated and high traffic areas. The model uses a flat iron instead of a string to release water without a need to touch the tap, as shown in Pic 2 below.-As part of its response to the COVID-19, UNDP is partnering with Relationships Inspiring Social Enterprise (RISE), the Ministry of Health and Maseru City Council to deploy these improved dispensers to local communities, targeting bus-stop areas, market centres, border posts and other populous areas to promote the culture of hygiene in these areas. Local communities and authorities will be responsible for maintaining the service by refilling the water and detergents as needed. The dispenses will be produced in two sizes, a household single dispenser and larger containers for populated areas. -

This timely announcement follows the rollout of the UN Decade for Action, which aims at accelerating action and making real progress towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.-The latest Global Environmental Outlook report states that up to 7 million people die every year from diseases associated with air pollution and another 1.4 million die from diseases associated with drinking untreated water.-Preserving and restoring our ecosystems can bring benefits that save lives. A healthy ecosystem provides fresh air and clean water. Ecosystem restoration programmes can also generate jobs – in fact, many countries aiming to bounce back from COVID-19 job losses, and to promote climate change adaptation, have launched green, job creating programmes such as fish and tree nurseries, waste collection and recycling enterprises, mangrove restoration and reforestation initiatives, among others.-Liberia has rich, unique, and diverse ecosystems that can drive sustainable pro-poor prosperity and development. Liberia is the only country in the Upper Guinea forest which still has more than half of its tropical rainforest intact. Its picturesque lakes and rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean, supplying water to farmlands and nourishing other economic activities along the way. Robertsport in Grand Cape Mount County is home to the Lake Piso Multi-Purpose Reserve— the country’s first wetland protection (Ramsar) site, an apt venue for this year’s World Environment Day celebrations.-This is a historic city, and UNDP is pleased to see efforts being made to prevent littering and mangrove destruction in this beautiful reserve. Stricter measures are also needed to curb unsustainable fishing practices such as the use of dangerous chemicals, and small nets that catch even hatchlings.-As Liberia works to restore its ecosystems and deliver on its international commitments to protect the environment, partnerships (national and international) are vital in accelerating progress. UNDP is proud to partner with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a wide range of other national and international institutions in these efforts. For example, UNDP, with support from Denmark, Luxemburg, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland, is partnering with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to pilot financial grants for civil society organizations to mobilize and organize youth eco-brigades to promote public health and safety in their communities.-In May, UNDP trained 75 youth volunteers on starting and running businesses focusing on long-term protection of the environment. It was great to also collaborate with the EPA and UN Volunteers including other young people on World Environment Day to clean up the beaches, clear overgrown bush thickets, and educate the community on public health.-UNDP has also collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Liberian Meteorological Services to establish a Climate Change Early Warning system that is providing climate modelling and forecasting information to help farmers and Liberians in general better cope with unpredictable weather patterns. With funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), UNDP launched a Small Grants Programme to support local NGOs undertake community-based environmental activities such as waste management, climate-smart agriculture including bee farming, and biodiversity conservation, all of which are increasing communities’ resilience to climate change and diversifying their livelihood options.-With resources from the GEF, UNDP also worked with the EPA, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and local communities to construct protective revetments to prevent coastal erosion in the face of rising sea levels resulting from climate change. This was done in Buchanan and New Kru Town. Larger scale programmes to protect livelihoods and prevent coastal erosion in West Point and Sinoe will come on stream in the next few months.-Communities around the Grebo-Krahn National Forest and other forest areas are learning new ways to protect the forest ecosystems. Our support to the communities include (i) training women farmers in sustainable agriculture practices; (ii) providing them with portable power tillers; and (iii) distributing seeds to improve food production outside protected areas. Community members are also being trained in sustainable harvesting of non-timber forest products, such as honey.-In partnership with the Government of Liberia and the Embassy of Sweden, UNDP supported Liberia’s ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2018. Today, we continue this collaboration as Liberia revises its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).-Similarly, UNDP continue to work with the Government of Liberia, the Embassy of Sweden, and other national partners to strengthen governance and environmental management for the artisanal mining sector. Together, we are developing user-friendly tools for artisanal miners and supporting participatory monitoring and multi-stakeholder engagement in the sector.-Working with the Ministry of Health and other national partners, and with funding from the GEF, UNDP is helping to mitigate climate change in Liberia by providing solar energy to 12 rural health centres in 7 counties, thereby increasing access to health services at the Saint Timothy Hospital, Sinje Health Center, Gokala Clinic, Palala Health Center, and Telewoyan Hospital, among others. Our support is powering the most critical services – operating theatres, laboratories, and maternal and child healthcare.-Our collaboration with the Green Climate Fund resulted in the University of Liberia establishing a graduate program in Environmental Studies and Climate Change to equip more Liberians with skills to explore and develop solutions to reduce ecosystem degradation.-These examples of work we have achieved together demonstrate that collective action is essential in delivering the critical wins we urgently need in protecting our environment and reversing the damage to our ecosystem. We can act together, including in our families and in our communities, to restore our environment and safeguard Liberia’s natural resources. So, act! Collective action can deliver the impact we want! I encourage you to take small or large actions, either individually, or as groups during this decade of ecosystem restoration to expedite progress in repairing our environment.-We will only be successful in restoring our ecosystem if we work together. As we begin to consider a post-Covid period we have an opportunity to build back better and to do things differently. UNDP will continue to work closely with the Government of Liberia and with civil society organisations, the private sector, and international development partners to protect and rebuild Liberia’s ecosystems. Together, we can restore Liberia’s Ecosystem and protect the environment. Let’s act... together, for a better planet!-Mr. Stephen Rodriques is the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme in Liberia.",[],"Climate change and disaster risk reduction,News,Blog post"

The Declaration, as relevant today as it was then, outlines principles protecting the press from interference by governmental, political, or economic interests. It brought home to the global community that progress depends on having a free, pluralistic, and independent press. The UN followed their lead and accepted the call to declare 3 May as World Press Freedom Day.-The Declaration emphasised that information is a public good to which everyone is entitled, and this was the theme for this year’s celebration of World Press Freedom Day. Information is both a means and an end to the fulfilment of collective human aspirations, including those enshrined in Chapter 3 Article 15A of the  Liberian Constitution, in the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and in the African Union’s Agenda 2063.-A fair and credible media is the lifeblood of a free and transparent society. As stated in the Windhoek Declaration “Enhanced transparency makes for public accountability.” Journalism, and especially high-quality investigative journalism, has the power to hold a government accountable to its electorate, to uncover the truth behind the operations of public and private institutions, and to provide citizens with oversight over the activities of the State. Citizens with access to credible and timely information on the decisions that impact their daily lives can make their voices heard and their needs known. Access to information is fundamental for democracy to function.-Speaking truth to power, however, can come at a cost. Too often, and in too many countries, journalists work in an environment that imperils both their lives and their livelihoods. Here in Liberia, the 2019 Abdulai Kamara Press Freedom Act effectively decriminalised “libel”, “sedition,” and “criminal malevolence” - and this was a major step towards expanding democratic rights - but still there is an atmosphere of self-censorship based on actual violence as well as threats of violence against journalists.-Attacks on and threats against journalists and media outlets have been on the increase since 2018, reaching a crescendo in the lead-up to the 2020 elections. Last year, there were 28 reported incidents of violence and intimidation against journalists, according to a report from the Press Union of Liberia and the Committee to Protect Journalists. While some acts were perpetrated by private citizens, far too many involved instruments of State power. In this same period, Liberia slipped three spots, to 95 of 180 countries surveyed, in the 2021 Reporters Without Borders’ annual World Press Freedom Index. These are worrying signs and should be of concern for both the Government of Liberia and its partners.-An environment in which the media can operate freely and independently results not only from the work and the political will of Government, but also from the demands of the people. At the same time, equipping both citizens and journalists with the skills needed to distinguish between fact and falsehood, between journalism and opinion, makes them a bulwark against disinformation.-Shining a bright light into the darkest corners is what the best journalism can accomplish. To quote the great investigative journalist Bob Woodward, “Democracy dies in darkness.”-Through our programmes, both the Government of Sweden and UNDP are committed to fostering freedom of expression and access to information, both online and offline, in line with international guarantees of these rights. We support a free, independent, and pluralistic media, while reinforcing the need to protect the safety of journalists, with a specific focus on women journalists. We will continue to nurture media development and information literacy throughout our work, and we will strive to help improve people’s access to relevant, diverse, and reliable information.-In everything we do in Liberia, we work with the Government to help expand peoples’ options and opportunities. Development, ultimately, is about whether people are able to live long, healthy, and meaningful lives, to make choices, and to have a say in things that matter to their own development. Access to information plays a critical role in ensuring that people are well informed in making choices and decisions, and about what is happening in their communities, their country and the world at large.-Development relies on an informed citizenry, and this, in turn, can only be assured through the work of free, independent, and professional journalists.-H.E.

Members of the informal economy collect recyclable materials and thereby cause significant contributions to municipal waste management. The more recycling the municipalities in Tripoli can put in place; the less rubbish goes to the landfill. Hence, the informal sector plays a part in resource conservation by recycling materials. Unfortunately, in Tripoli and the wider Libya, informal recycling is operating at a huge scale without being observed neither considered.-Due to the precarious economic situation, lack of investment opportunities, inadequate training, and a need for further cooperation with many municipalities, the potential in terms of sustainable employment opportunities within this sector are far from being exhausted.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Innovation,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Arab states,Libya,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,English,Accelerator Labs"

My doubt was between engineering and architecture, but then, a man told me ‘Engineering is a profession for men’. I believe that was the exact moment when I decide to become an Engineer. Why a profession had to be more suitable for men than for women?-Since I finished my engineering studies in Spain, I have been working in different countries such as Ghana, Iraq and now in Libya, where there are even fewer women working within the construction industry than in Spain, and that statement come to my mind constantly (‘Engineering is a profession for men’). I have to say that being a female within a field mainly dominated by men has not always been easy and that gender stereotypes have yet to be struggled within the construction field.-However, I also must admit that during my work experience with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) within the Arab region, I have been professionally respected and valued by my male colleagues and supervisees. Personally, I believe that the female engineering presence smoothies the usually rough environment that typifies the sector. Women engineers, we are normally highly skilled in planning, organizing and business oriented. Additionally, the ability of empathize and connect with the emotions of others, provide female engineers with a great advantage when managing teams. All these skills, together with a professional aptitude place female engineers in a very high scale. So, I do not believe Engineering is a profession only for men.","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Inclusive growth,Blog post,Arab states,Libya,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 5  Gender equality,Women's empowerment,Sustainable development,Gender equality,English"

-The Accelerator Labs in Ghana, Libya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vietnam, Paraguay, Laos, and Ukraine joined the Collective Intelligence Design Studio (CIDS) in Istanbul this year. The initiative organized by UNDP and Nesta, Innovation Foundation, aims to support UNDP’s Accelerator Labs teams to design and implement a prototype collective intelligence to address issues related to waste management in the 11 countries.-The essence of the collective intelligence (CI) methodology is tapping into a large and diverse number of groups. Empowering people is at the centre of CI protocol using technology and data in the quest to solve complex issues. We start by listening to understand, build knowledge and then react by engaging with new voices to achieve a unique solution. In Africa, we intended to engage with multiple actors involved in solid waste management such as private sector, and community municipalities, using uncommon data and tools like geographic information system (GIS) and crowd-mapping to understand the waste issue.-Many African cities are experiencing rapid urbanization, forcing governments and the private sector to face a host of challenges, such as access to clean water and waste management services for over 200 million slum dwellers (in Sub Saharan Africa). In Ghana, the Accelerator Lab is partnering with Jekora Ventures, a private waste management company, to prototype a tailored waste collection approach in slum settlements. Jekora's GIS mapping of all communities (see below image) provided valuable insights on the hotspots in the zone and which communities need first the support. Building on this data, the team has engaged and crowdsourced ideas from community leaders, vendors, residents, waste collectors, and revenue agents to better understand local dwellers' waste issues.-From these engagements, we discovered some peculiar socio-economic issues such as lack of space for collection equipment, lack of adequate sanitation infrastructure – urinals and toilets - and activities of homeless actors in slum settlements that are making the delivery of waste collection services extra challenging and financially unsustainable. To overcome the above challenges, there is the need to co-create local solutions and tailor them to slum conditions. For example, in the project’s prototyping location, waste needs to be collected more frequently, even twice daily in some cases. Different payment models - e.g. pay per dump and weekly payments - are also necessary to encourage signups by various beneficiaries.-In a country like Libya, where instability remains a substantial challenge, particularly on the municipal levels and the services provided to the citizens, waste management issues are the order of the day. A strategy of solid waste management (SWM) at the municipality level is un-presented, and that becomes a problematic element to any intervention or solutions offered by key players. The existence of a strategy can give us a clear path and how and why to overcome the endless issue of SWM in Libya. A visualization tool, data and updated information about the situation in the streets is needed to build this strategy.-UNDP Libya Accelerator Lab identified the leverage point to support the municipalities by creating a dashboard of SWM that showcases the data of solid waste in the streets. The data is collectively sourced by key stakeholders such as waste collectors, municipalities, NGOs, and more importantly, the citizens who will be empowered to take part in the initiative to keep the cities clean. The Accelerator Lab team in Libya made in-house a prototype of the dashboard, which presents multiple information updated weekly by the stakeholders through a phone App. The App shows the locations of waste, its size and type (see below).-The hypothesis for creating the dashboard is that if it is adopted and used by the municipalities, they would be able to manage resources efficiently with fewer efforts.-The Tanzania Acc Lab designed an experiment to find out whether the use of satellite/drone imagery and open data sources could enhance data in solid waste management and consequently improve future municipal programming. -To conduct the experiment, the team followed these steps; 1) Creation of a task on the open street map platform www.tasks.hotosm.org to divide the pilot area of Buhongwa ward into several squares for mapping; 2) Use of open imagery sources such as Bing and Maxar; 3) Review and validate mapped images by a GIS expert; 4) Upload data on the OpenStreetMap platform 5) Use ODK collect App to conduct a survey to understand community behaviours and perceptions related to solid waste management.-The outcome of this exercise will help the city to; 1) attract long and short term investments in its diverse resource endowments- and most importantly, in this case, pulling investors in circularity business and; 2) Enable the city council to scale out the project to other wards for the purposes of improving its  SWM service delivery and potentially reach its goal of becoming a smart city in the near future.  For more information check out this blog.-Malawi Acclab team engaged a diverse range of stakeholders to understand the key drivers of an unmanaged waste challenge given that waste collection by the municipal council is as low as 12%.  The key take-out was that the drivers of the problem were lack of awareness of proper management of waste for households, lack of waste management innovations, lack of collaboration among stakeholders in the eco-system (especially private waste collectors and municipal council) and lack of financing.  Initially, there was a hypothesis that the city council may need support in changing by-laws to improve operations, but the team learned that it is easy to update bylaws.  The team learnt that some households were able to self-regulate.   -The Lab employed several techniques in the Collective Intelligence Playbook, including organizing a virtual mapathon in liaison with a local tech hub (mHub), Government’s Surveys Department and a group of volunteer mappers who worked from their various homes.  The principal aim of the exercise was to identify the various resources available in Area 25 that are playing a role in generating and distributing waste. 15 volunteers trained in mapping and updated and clearly labelled map with over 1,000 structures mapped using an open access online map, OpenStreetMap.-Given the COVID-19  related restrictions, the Lab employed Online Community Engagement technique using survey monkey and learned that most of the waste is not separated (67%) and is not made available to recyclers (44%) due to use of rubbish pits and burning. Households disposing of waste outside their homes are relying more on private waste collectors than city and district councils. The team concluded that there is a huge opportunity in promoting recycling initiatives which require collaboration between households, private waste collectors and city and district councils to be effective.-Reflections of the four African countries-The GIS, satellite images, street mapping and tapping into a new data have all injected into SWM project in Ghana, Libya, Tanzania, and Malawi - working with diverse/uncommon actors and empowering people to achieve something unique and different.-During the journey in designing and building the collective inelegance projects, the four Labs in Africa noted that empowering citizens by being an active part in the projects is one of the most valuable/powerful pillars in our intervention. However, yet, how the engagement by citizens can be sustained? this is the challenge.-The next stage of the projects is to assess what works and what doesn’t in case the prototype is workable, we can then scale up to create an impact – if doesn’t, then perhaps some adjustments could require making it works. We will find out soon.- -For more information about UNDP Accelerator Lab visit: https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org","['Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Malawi,Chemicals and waste management,Blog post,United Republic of Tanzania ,Libya,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Ghana,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

The United Nations family seizes the occasion to raise awareness of pollution, climate change, and sustainable consumption.-This year, the celebration is marked by the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.-Within the past four decades, research has been increasingly drawn toward understanding the link between the human-nature relationship and its impact on people’s health.-Today, I can’t help but to think about the words that the UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande pronounced on 22 April, Earth Mother’s Day: “Our experience with COVID-19 demonstrates that we, humanity, are not separate from the world around us”, he said. “In this Decade of Action and Delivery to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)...we must work together to protect our planet and ecosystems, which affect every aspect of human life”.-We are not just linked to nature, we came from nature and as part of it whatever we do in its environment won’t only affect animals or plants, but us directly or indirectly.-Humans’ behavior influences every single aspect of the environment. Just spoiling with one of these elements and seeing how the health and food systems collapse. We, as humans, have been messing up with not only one but too many elements of nature for too long: water, soil, and air pollution, deforestation; natural resources exploitation...-One of the clear consequences of our behavior is that 1 million species are facing extinction.-This year the theme of World Environment Day 2020 is “Celebrate Biodiversity” just when the COVID-19 pandemic is shocking the world with the consequences we face when biodiversity is compromised. Hence, demonstrating the interdependence of humans and the webs of life, in which we exist.-From my experience in conflict-affected areas, I learned that disasters create opportunities. I see the worldwide crisis that this pandemic is causing as an opportunity to build back better and to stop mistreating the nature that gives us the foods we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the climate that makes our planet habitable.-In the midst of the pandemic, digital technologies have captured our attention for their potential to help us in the fight against COVID-19. In UNDP, we think in the long-term, looking at innovative ways to support Libya to better prevent and manage such crises and ensure that the country makes full use of the lessons learned from it.-Through our Accelerator Lab, we are collaborating with the private sector and investing in innovation and digital development to enhance digital solutions to tackle the challenges of waste management in Libya, which affect biodiversity and nature.-According to a study conducted by the Head of Technical Centre for Environmental Protection, Dr. Bashir Faris, in 2002, there were around 131,651.20 tons of plastic waste in Greater Tripoli per year. The Accelerator Lab has been able to confirm that the plastic waste present in Libya has increased due to the daily use of plastics packages and plastic water bottles, and the absence of any charge or tax for the use of these plastics. This is added to the open burning of waste in residential areas that have been a problem in the whole country for too long.-Together with its key partners, the Lab is exploring four innovative solutions to tackle the waste management challenges in Libya:-1.            Gather information: tapping into collective intelligence methodologies and engaging with actors from the private sector, the community, civil society, and government agencies, the Accelerator Lab is working to offer Janzour municipality several solutions in order to efficiently manage waste collection such as a digital dashboard to visualize the waste and environment situation in the municipality. A data collection tool that local activists would feed through their mobile phones with information about waste locations, types, and volume.-2.            Change Behavior: the lab conducted behavioral Insights experiences in the biggest supermarkets in Tripoli to explore how to reduce the single-use plastic bags consumption. Another experiment took place in primary schools in Tripoli by placing recycling waste bin boxes to educate kids on garbage segregation from the source.-3.            Use of Technology: The Accelerator Lab in Libya conducted an innovation challenge to create digital solutions to manage waste collection tasks at one of the municipalities in Tripoli. The team asked people to use an App for reporting street waste dumping sites and open burning of trashes that occurred across the city. With this initiative, the Lab is testing technology to help municipalities to better plan and utilize their resources more efficiently, involving citizens as part of the solution. If the project works for one municipality, it could eventually scale up across the country.-The painter Rembrandt said,” Choose only one master: nature.”-In this era of technology, I would also add “Choose a tool: digital innovation.”- ","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Coronavirus COVID-19,Innovation,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 15  Life on land,Blog post,Arab states,Libya,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Gerardo Noto,English,Accelerator Labs"

Tripoli's municipalities rely on designated landfills through public sector companies (PCCs), to get rid of the trash.-Tripoli’s designated landfill, Sidi Sayeh, happens to be in the conflict area and is currently inaccessible, which has triggered to streets loaded with bags of mixed waste.  Occasionally, the waste is collected by trucks, only to be dumped in temporary locations. This approach has created discomfort among residents and caused environmental challenges.-Through these initiatives, the Lab has discovered that one of the major culprits of the environmental issues in Libya is the overuse of plastic bags obtained for free from the shops and used only once.-According to the World Bank, in 2016, the world generated 242 million tonnes of plastic waste —12 percent of all municipal solid waste. In Libya, the Public Service Company (Government-owned) revealed that Tripoli city produces 999,356.13 tonnes of solid waste annually. A study conducted by the Head of Technical Centre for Environmental Protection, Dr. Bashir Faris (2002), recorded that 13.17% was made up of plastic. This means that only Tripoli city produced 131,615.20 tonnes of plastic. The study is old, but it was the latest evidence found; however, the daily use of plastics packages in Libya made evident that the presence of plastic waste has increased in Libya. People rely heavily on plastic water bottles and bags, mainly because the shopping bags are distributed for free in all types of shops.-The negative impact on the environment and human health is notably seen in the streets, farms and beaches across the country. The plastic waste has caused floods in numerous streets in Tripoli by clogging drains. Respiratory diseases are worsened due to the burning of waste by people intending to reduce overflowing garbage.-The Lab has discussed with many individuals, government and non-governmental organizations to better understand the trends and issues regarding SWM in the country. It has also conducted a workshop to promote collective intelligence efforts and develop ideas for experiments.","['Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Innovation,Blog post,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Arab states,Libya,partnerships,UNDP Donor Partners,System Thinking,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs,English"

We rehabilitate schools but literacy rates do not necessarily rise. We build hospitals but there are people still dying from preventable and curable diseases.-We have learned that there are too many development initiatives, although well-intended, that have modest impact on people lives. Is not clear by now that to make a difference in the field of development we should go beyond repeating the same actions and expecting different results?-I would say that we have been maybe too sane, taking the words of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, author of 'Don Quijote,' when he said that ""Too much sanity can be the worst of crazy things; See life as it is and not as it should be.”-The concept ‘insanity’, ‘madness’ or ‘craziness’ is ambivalent as can be proven by its evolution throughout history. Madness has a negative connotation. It was linked to supernatural and demonic influences in ancient times. At the end of the 19th century, madness started to be conceived as a behavior that is positioned against social norms. Nowadays, “madness” has been acknowledged as an indispensable quality of genius and the wise. People as relevant as Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Darwin, Marie Curie or Leonardo da Vinci, were called crazy in their days and recognized of genius later and well-ahead of their times.-The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was founded in 1965 to help countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable human development. A crazy idea, wasn't it?-Since its creation, UNDP has envisioned life as it should be: full of opportunities for all, women, men, children and generations to come.  We have re-aligned our support to 170 countries around the world to meet emerging priorities with a clear goal: help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience to achieve inclusive economic growth and equality in a sustainable manner.-We are currently living at a time in history when our lives are deeply shaped by information and communications technologies (ICT). Human society has changed dramatically in ways hardly imaginable some years ago.  There are infinite “crazy” new initiatives worldwide. UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner, pointed out: “We realized that UNDP needs to draw on lessons learnt in the fields of innovation and entrepreneurship to deliver a more dynamic approach to accelerating the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.”-The 60 UNDP Accelerator Labs that are being launched worldwide to test and scale new solutions to development challenges, is our way of going “crazy” to bring new breeze to UNDP and sustainable development around the world.-In Libya, another kind of madness has been punishing people for a long time. After promising changes in 2011, divisions and violence have trapped Libyans in a protracted conflict preventing them to move forward on a sustainable development path to realize the amazing potential of its people and national resources. Too many lives have been sacrificed to war. Too many people have been displaced. Too many migrants have suffered exploitation and abuse or die at sea. Women have been heavily burdened by the consequences of war, suffering gender-based violence and violations of their human rights. Children have been prevented to access quality education. People do not receive health services badly needed. Basic services have been negatively impacted by conflict and neglected infrastructure. Lack of opportunities discourage young people who have seen their life projects interrupted. Sustainable development seems an unreachable dream.-In UNDP Libya, we believe that another path is possible and urgently needed. There are committed and dynamic actors ready and eager to build up a different country. There is a path through peace and inclusive development as an alternative to non-sense violence. We have chosen the ‘genius craziness’ to empower innovative actors and look for synergies to solve development problems. The Accelerator Lab in Libya has been designed as a development catalyzer through exploration, solutions mapping and experimentation.-UNDP Accelerator Lab in Libya began working to find like-minded and innovative people to help get ideas and try them out without fear of failure. The short cycle of experimentation and scaling up of successful ideas will allow the innovators to learn from successes and failures.-We have already set up a team within the country office to move forward. Following an intensive bootcamp, where the team was exposed to the most effective techniques and tools, they returned to Libya to implement their ideas on the ground. Our priority for the next 100 days is solid waste management - a daring problem in everyday life in the country.-The UNDP Libya Accelerator Lab will bring together: i) grassroots solutions from local organizations and individuals to try them up and to scale up, ii) private companies eager to work with their communities, iii) and governmental institutions that need support implementing policies and solutions to challenges like solid waste management. They will collectively map issues and solutions, and experiment and test out their ideas with the help of UNDP and their partners.-Due to the conflicts that Libya has experienced since 2011, most of the development initiatives that have been implemented in the country aimed at withstanding the impairments of war. Now, we are trying something else. They may call us crazy, but only craziness can make a difference. As William Blake said, “If the madman persisted in his madness, he would become wise.” We are definitely joining the world that is going crazy, as many say, to contribute to peace, stability and a better future in Libya. We hope soon people will look at our “crazy” efforts as a little shot at “genius” when talking about the Accelerator Lab in Libya.- - - ","['Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Innovation,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,UNDP Donor Partners,Gerardo Noto,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Sensemaking,Libya,Goal 13  Climate action,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,English"

Considered as the main source of life on Earth, oceans are home to billions of species and contribute to the livelihood of a third of humanity. The theme for this year’s United Nations World Oceans Day, celebrated on 8 June 2022, is Revitalization: Collective Action for the Ocean. -Unfortunately, persistent pressure from human activities is accelerating the warming and eutrophication of oceans, resulting in the melting of polar ice caps and the spread of dead zones around the world. Today, ocean heat has reached record levels. If nothing is done to collectively reverse this trend, vital ecosystems such as coral reefs will disappear by 2050.-During the 2016 global coral bleaching event in Mauritius, 40 percent to 50 percent of the total live coral cover was impacted, while over 60 percent of sites in Seychelles experienced high or extreme bleaching, with a coral mortality rate of approximately 30 percent. This impact is especially alarming for Small Island Developing States such as Mauritius and Seychelles which depend on the ecosystem services of their lagoons for livelihoods.-According to the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) Plan of Action 2021-2024, actions should be taken to “understand and promote the resilience of coral reefs and related ecosystems through policies and conservation practices that encourage resilience-based management and recovery of coral reefs worldwide”.- -Adaptation through Coral reef rehabilitation-The United Nations Development Programme invests in the protection of coastal communities, fisheries and marine ecosystems, including coral reefs from climate change impacts, particularly disaster risks, through nature-based climate solutions such as mangrove restoration, coral reef rehabilitation, and marine protected areas.-In 2020, the UNDP started the implementation of the ‘Restoring Marine Ecosystem Services by Restoring Coral Reefs to Meet a Changing Climate Future’ project (known as Coral Restoration project) in the Republic of Mauritius and the Republic of Seychelles. Funded by the Adaptation Fund (AF), this 6-year project has for overall objective to reduce the impacts of climate change on local communities and coral reef-dependent economic sectors. The project also aims at improving food security and livelihoods and mitigate disaster risk through active restoration of coral reefs degraded by coral bleaching. The project’s objective includes the rehabilitation of at least 3.2 hectares of degraded sites in Mauritius and 2.5 hectares in Seychelles. This also entails a positive outcome for at least 800 people, as a result of new and sustained employment and business opportunities.-In this regard, the UNDP is working with several institutional stakeholders and NGOs in both countries. The UNDP is collaborating with the Government of Seychelles, who has partnered with the Marine Conservation Society of Seychelles, Nature Seychelles and the Seychelles Parks and Gardens Authority.  In Mauritius, the UNDP is working with the Ministry of Blue Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and Shipping, the Albion Fisheries Research Centre and the Mauritius Oceanography Institute, along with Eco-Sud and Reef Conservation.  In Rodrigues, the project is being implemented with the support of the Rodrigues Regional Assembly and Shoals Rodrigues.-The project also aims to work in partnership with NGOs and community members in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles to support sustainable coral restoration activities as a means to build the resilience of oceanic ecosystems. Training in coral restoration activities has recently started in the south-east of Mauritius, while ocean nurseries have already been deployed in Seychelles.- -Heat Resilient Corals:  A Nature-based solution-Over the past years, several methods have been developed for coral restoration. Traditionally, corals which have resisted past bleaching events were used as mother colonies for propagating ocean nurseries and coral restoration activities. However, the concern with this method is that there is no certainty as to whether or not these restoration sites will survive future coral bleaching events.-One of the initiatives under UNDP-AF Coral Restoration project is to determine the heat resilient corals in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles for future restoration activities. This scientific approach, which began in January 2022, involves the identification of coral reefs that have been exposed to recurrent thermal stress and which have proved to be tolerant against heat.-The genomic studies will help establish which corals in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles are more resilient to heat, and can subsequently be propagated in ocean and land-based nurseries. A higher survival rate of restored corals following heat waves is expected with this technique.

In 2017, the global fishing industry had generated USD 150 billion, while around 150 million tons of fish were consumed in 2018. With technologies such as GPS, satellite-based radio-navigation, radars, underwater current meters and acoustic sounders, modern commercial fishing vessels are able to navigate more accurately; better detect fish, and significantly increase their catches to meet the rising global demand for seafood.
-In Mauritius and Rodrigues, semi-industrial fishing vessels have been using new technologies quite proficiently for the past 2 decades. However, the situation is different for the ageing artisanal fishers who are still using traditional navigation techniques and struggle in overfished and pressured lagoons. Besides, the declining lagoon biodiversity makes it increasingly difficult for the artisanal fishing community to earn a living. One possible future for them is found on the high sea, and it requires embracing new fishing technologies and digital solutions. Introducing such technologies to artisanal fishers will not only make off-lagoon fishing safer and more productive, but also allow more sustainable fishing. At a time when global fish stocks has dropped by a third since 1974, technology is key to better manage fisheries and ensure their resilience. Through the ECOFISH Mauritius project being implemented by UNDP, solutions including innovation and upskilling are being proposed to artisanal fishers to facilitate exploration of new fishing grounds off the lagoons.- -Fish Aggregating Devices – a multifaceted solution-One way towards ensuring better catches for off-lagoon artisanal fishers is the use of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Commonly referred to as ""rafts”, FADs are floating structures anchored by ropes to the seafloor in the open sea. They are a refuge for smaller fish, which in turn attract bigger predator fish species such as tuna (thon), dolphinfish (dorade), wahoo (bécune) and billfishes. FADs present several benefits for artisanal fishers. They aggregate pelagic fish species and render their catch easier. The average catch from the FAD fishery is about 35 kg compared to 5-6 kg in the demersal lagoon fishery. A second major advantage of FADS is that they allow fishers to save on fuel and time by literally “bringing the fish to the fishers”.-In Mauritius and Rodrigues, FADs were introduced in 1985 and 1987 respectively to divert fishing efforts from the exploited lagoons to the open sea while increasing and diversifying the income of the artisanal fishers. Placed in 28 and 22 strategic locations beyond the reefs of Mauritius and Rodrigues respectively, FADs coupled with common fishing techniques such as handlines, trolling with artificial or natural lures, baited drift-lines, and vertical longlines, play a significant role in the catch of pelagic fish. The vertical longline targets the albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), which migrate in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Republic of Mauritius during austral summer months, and is one of the world's more commercially valuable fish.-A major player of global fisheries, the tuna industry has been using drifting FADs (dFADs) to optimize catches since 2005. dFADs are equipped with solar powered satellite buoys fitted with GPS technology and echo-sounders that provide data on the quantity of fish below the buoy in near-real time. Such technologies are presently being improved to enhance sustainable fishing. With more accurate data on the fish population under the buoy, fishers will be able to discriminate the targeted and non-targeted fish species, minimize bycatch, and spare juvenile fish. On the same line, technologies embarked on FADs can also be key to improve the monitoring of fishing vessels on the oceans and help fight IUU fishing which represents around 15% of the world’s total catches, and a value of EUR 24 billion annually.-As any technology, FADS also have disadvantages. The number of FADs lost annually due to wear and tear or collision with large vessels is on the high side. Moreover, due to strong currents, FADs, such as the currently used rosary type FAD set in Mauritius and Rodrigues, may sink several meters deep. This not only results in damage due to high pressure on the instruments attached to the FAD but also prevents fishers from finding their fishing grounds. Finally, although “rafts” are set for the benefit of the artisanal fishers, in the absence of legislations, recreation and sports fishing boats can fish around FADs and compete with the artisanal fishers who depend on catches for a living.- -Contributions of the Mauritius ECOFISH Project to communities.-The project aims at supporting the artisanal fishing community for the sustainable management of coastal fisheries and to improve their economic situation. This will include innovative and sustainable solutions allowing them to (i) fish around FADs, (ii) use updated fish landing stations and (iii) derive benefits from improved post-harvest processes while integrating more women and the youth in fishing.-Implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Blue Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and Shipping, and the Rodrigues Regional Assembly, the project aims will facilitate the procurement and installation of new generation FADS. These smart anchored rafts, built to resist collisions with passing vessels, will be equipped with a solar powered satellite buoy with integrated GPS, sensors, and an echo-sounder for biomass estimation. The satellite buoy is also integrated with microprocessors allowing raw data to be collected, analysed and processed, so that fishers receive filtered and accurate information.-Under the project, a complementary mobile phone application is also being developed to allow artisanal fishers to directly access information gathered by the smart FADs. Training in the use of FADs, GPS localization and reading of biomass information, and sensitization campaigns on best fishing practices will also be designed for artisanal fishers, including young people and women.-During awareness meetings organized by UNDP in October and November 2021, fishers of various regions of Mauritius have already demonstrated interest towards the new fishing technologies presented to them under the project. According to Mr. Patrick Fortuno, Representative of the Trou D’eau Douce Fishers Cooperative, artisanal fishers have much to benefit from a professionalization of the artisanal fishing activity and from upskilling.-The activities planned under the ECOFISH (Mauritius) project are in line with the new UNDP Strategic Plan 2022-2025 which promotes solutions powered by digitalization, innovation and development financing – for greater impact. At the level of the Regional Ecofish Programme, the creation of a regional framework to improve data collection on the contribution of fisheries in the national economy of Eastern Africa, Southern Africa and Indian Ocean Region countries is on the way.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Jean Lindsay Azie,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,UNDP Donor Partners,Sunil Panray Beeharry,Goal 14  Life below water,Mauritius,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The trade of fresh vegetables and fruits involves farmers, auctioneers, intermediaries, delivery service providers, transformers, retailers, and consumers at the end of the chain. The market benefits and turnovers of marketing agricultural produce are significant; however, farmers, who are at the beginning of the chain, do not always get the best returns from their investment. Constraints of production, mainly due to changing climatic conditions, and poor marketing practices, are considerably reducing farmers’ share of the profits, forcing several traditional farmers to retire from this activity, and discouraging the young generation from embracing agriculture. Innovative solutions that enhance access to markets and increase profit margins are critical for promoting agriculture.-Investing in E-Market solutions could present opportunities to farmers
-In the context of the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many producers and traders in Mauritius used social media solutions to sell fresh vegetables and fruits. A study commissioned by the UNDP under the project “Supporting an Inclusive and Multi-Sectoral Response to COVID-19 and Addressing its Socio-Economic Impact in the Republic of Mauritius”, reported that the lockdown has contributed to the rapid adoption of online shopping in Mauritius, triggered by improved services offered by e-commerce service providers. Based on expert interviews and 750 households’ interviews, a 10% to 15% increase in online purchases was observed between the 2020 and 2021 lockdowns.-The rise of e-Commerce results in new opportunities for participation in trade, but also presents new challenges to farmers and institutions in upgrading to e-Commerce competitiveness. For instance, only 2% of shoppers purchased fruits and vegetables online during the last 3 months as they strongly felt the need to choose their products themselves. In addition, the lack of logistics significantly restrained the performance and sustainability of the online methods. Some also mentioned unfairness and illegal practices due to the lack of a proper platform for trading vegetables and fruits. Another factor is that large and online distributors and fruit sellers prefer to deal with suppliers directly to reduce intermediary costs.-A first step towards adopting the “Farm to Fork” concept in the country.
-In line with UNDP’s digitalisation agenda, the implementation of the upcoming e-Marketplace for vegetables and fruits by the UNDP in collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Research and Extension Institute (FAREI), is expected to transform the lives of Mauritian farmers. The e-Marketplace is expected not only to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers, but also create numerous opportunities including but not limited to: enhanced access with the possibility of negotiation leading to an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the field of transformation and development of derived products; development of auxiliary services such as packaging, pickup, and delivery services; and establishment of standards and norms for vegetables and fruits as well as average prices; and planned production and contractual undertakings by farmers to avoid gluts and maintain reasonable prices.-The successful implementation of the e-Marketplace platform requires that both farmers and consumers accept to use this new technology, which could be a first step towards adopting the “Farm to Fork” concept in the country.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Vichittra Purdassee,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Dr. Sumayya Mauthoor,Green commodities,Mauritius,UNDP,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,English"

With 2030 fast approaching, we need all hands on deck and make use of all available resources to reach our set targets . With an estimated  more than a billion volunteers around the world, volunteerism is a key resource that can be better harnessed, nurtured, and passed on to the next generation.-Valuing the role of volunteers               -The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme defines volunteerism as an expression of people's willingness and capacity to freely help others and improve their society. While the ‘origin’ of volunteerism remains debatable, there is common understanding that volunteering has always been  part of the social fabric. Volunteering actions have helped to link communities across common strategies and to deal with complex problems. For example, some of the underpinnings of the “ubuntu” philosophy speak to voluntary collective action for the common good.-From the onset of the pandemic and lockdowns, there has been an unexpected spike in volunteering activities around the globe. Volunteers from all age groups and backgrounds  have chipped in to help their near and distant neighbours during the pandemic to access food through food banks, supported frontline healthcare workers with accommodation and providing shelter for survivors of domestic violence. Volunteers have also joined hands with governments, the private sector and civil society to scale up grassroots efforts to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, and  to ensure the inclusion of the unheard and of the most vulnerable.-The UN General Assembly proclaimed ‘International Volunteer Day (IVD)’ in 1985, which is observed every 5th of December. IVD  offers an  opportunity to promote and celebrate volunteering actions and contributions to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local, regional, national and international levels. Volunteers were at the centre of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and continue to  have an important role to play for the 2030 agenda. That said, it is estimated that 70% of the total volunteers globally do so informally. So, how can the scale and scope of volunteering resources be amplified to achieve the SDGs by 2030?- - -Collaborating for the SDGs-The UN Volunteer system, administered by the UNDP, acts as a platform to promote and integrate  volunteerism across the UN entities. The UN Volunteers (UNVs) are motivated and qualified individuals who work in UN agencies, funds and programmes  at the national or international level. In 2020, more than 9,000 UN Volunteers were deployed across the UNDP programmes, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.-Given the importance of UNVs contributions, UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles has recruited UNVs to assist the Accelerator Lab to map community-led innovations into a database, the GRID. The UNVs will support community engagement through participatory dialogues and consultation to curate data and information on community coping mechanisms; document examples of resilience; and, map community-driven solutions to development challenges. Over a 6 months period, the Community UNVs will conduct  a massive data collection exercise across Mauritius, Rodrigues and the Seychelles to aggregated our knowledge and understanding of sustainable grassroots solutions to development challenges ranging from the socio-economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic to the environmental impacts of climate change.-Looking Ahead-Working together as a collective and tapping into the intelligence of the community to address development challenges is the good way to explore sustainable and inclusive solutions.-If you are a volunteer and would like to help us engage with the community and escalate grassroots and sustainable solutions, reach out to us by mail at acclab.mu.sey@undp.org.-Follow us as we share the insights of our journey with the UN Community Volunteers.

In recent decades, these traditional lagoon fishers have faced great challenges, including the steady decline of marine and coastal ecosystems. To earn a living, some artisanal fishers now venture out of the lagoon where they can explore waters high in fish resources, but riskier too. These men and women, embarked on frail canoes miles from the shore, are the future of artisanal fishing in the Republic of Mauritius. It is therefore crucial that they receive the necessary support to take this new step in the best possible conditions.-The paradox of fishing in Mauritius-Artisanal fishing is part of the traditions and culture of the Republic of Mauritius. It also contributes to the economy of coastal villages and the food security of the entire population. Unlike semi-industrial fishing, which is flourishing on the banks of Nazareth or St-Brandon, artisanal fishing near the Mauritian and Rodriguan coasts is declining. As proof, a paradox: artisanal fishermen are the main suppliers of fresh fish to the local market, but at the same time, constitute the most deprived economic group of the island.-With catches having decreased by about 35% between 2011 and 2017, the fishing community in the Republic of Mauritius is increasingly dependent on ""bad weather"" allowances. According to a 2011 European Union study,  the income of fishermen, including all allowances and benefits, is estimated at around USD 140 (MUR 6,010) monthly, while the average salary of the population is estimated at around USD 650 (MUR 27, 904).-Impacted by the decline of lagoon biodiversity and the decree of new ""marine protected areas"", artisanal fishermen have also been prevented from fishing by two lockdowns related to COVID-19 and the MV Wakashio incident in 2020. Today, to stay afloat, they need a new approach focused on innovation, sustainability, and the added value of fishery products.- -Getting artisanal fishing out of the rut-The limitations of lagoon fishing have highlighted the need to get artisanal fishing out of the rut. In order to alleviate the pressures on coastal biodiversity, the authorities have put emphasis on reorienting fishers’ activities towards the high sea. The ""Canotte"" program, which aims to facilitate the purchase of fishing boats and accessories adapted to deep-sea fishing, is part of this initiative. Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs)  – commonly referred to as ""rafts"" – have also been placed in 28 strategic locations to attract pelagic fish species and create new off-lagoon fishing areas.-However, so far, the ""rafts"" have not provided the results expected by artisanal fishers. This is partly explained by the high number of unregistered artisanal fishers not having access to suitable equipment for deep-sea fishing. In addition, many artisanal fishers deplore the unfair competition of amateur fishermen around FADs and the presence of foreign fishing boats near the Mauritian coast. Finally, for fishers who still use landmarks to navigate, venturing around the ""rafts"" remains risky, both in terms of safety, and economically.-Despite problems that need to be solved, fishing on the high seas provides very good reasons for hope. With the ability to access new navigation technologies and more adequate fishing equipment, fishing outside the lagoon is probably safer and more viable than in the past.- -Supporting the economic empowerment of the artisanal fishing community of the Republic of Mauritius-In order to safeguard the heritage and culture of artisanal fishers in Mauritius and Rodrigues, UNDP has started the implementation of the project ""Supporting the Economic Empowerment of the Artisanal Fishing Community of the Republic of Mauritius"", within the framework of the Ecofish interregional programme. This project, funded by the European Union, aims to provide artisanal fishers with the necessary resources to explore new fishing areas outside the lagoon. To ensure the support of members of the fishing community, the project team opted for a participatory approach, allowing beneficiaries to be involved in the implementation of the project which will be spread over a period of 3 years.-During meetings held in October and November 2021, the UNDP project team and artisanal fishermen were able to discuss topics related to artisanal fishing on the high seas. It showed that changing weather conditions due to climate change, lack of maintenance of FADs and illegal fishing represent real threats to artisanal fishermen. In response to these problems, the E€OFISH program will collaborate with the Ministry of Blue Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and Shipping to provide fishers with FADs equipped with satellite GPS buoys. In addition, a mobile application allowing fishermen to locate the FADs will be developed, and training in the use of GPS technologies will be provided to fishermen from 2022. The project will also contribute to the improvement of fish landing stations and provide training to optimise the added value of fishery products by 2024. The role of young people and women is not to be neglected in this project, whose success will depend largely on the capacity of the artisanal fishing community to reinvent itself.
-It is probably impossible to prevent all the risks associated with artisanal fishing on the high seas. However, the hope remains that this type of traditional fishery will be able to adapt to a new course, as real opportunities now exist for a safer and more sustainable exploitation of the deep-sea fishery resources of Mauritius and Rodrigues.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 5  Gender equality,Sharon Sunassee,Stéphane Bellerose,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Goal 4  Quality education,Jean-Yan Norbert,Goal 14  Life below water,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The project will support households in Seychelles access clean, emission-free solar energy through a socially innovative communal approach. -Like many other small island developing states (SIDS), Seychelles faces extremely high and fluctuating power costs resulting from dependency on mineral oil products for power generation and fuel for transportation. The current record high surges in power prices, driven by shortages in Asia and Europe, leave small islands like Seychelles extremely vulnerable to price volatility. Any fluctuation in crude oil prices poses a significant threat to economic development. High fuels costs have often led to a massive drain of hard currency from the economy and made electricity unaffordable for households and businesses.-Ambitious Climate Targets-According to the World Bank, Seychelles has a 100% electrification rate. The current electricity system is supplying power reliably to the population; however, it is oil-dependent, thus making it incompatible with future sustainable economic development. With this in mind, the Government of Seychelles is accelerating progress towards energy transition through Seychelles' 100% Renewable Energy Strategy (SeyRES 100), which furthers the recently updated NDC submitted by the country ahead of COP26. The updated NDC makes a 2030 commitment to modernize the entire electricity sector through increased electricity generation from renewable sources.
-The PV democratisation 2.0 project aims to increase access to solar PV to households who cannot afford a rooftop PV system, access a low-cost loan, or have a roof that is not conducive to installing a PV system. The project will create a financial vehicle for these consumers to own PV systems through a communal approach. The Government of Seychelles will identify large rooftops suitable for PV installation. Consumers can then buy a share of the system and pay it back by monthly installments through electricity bills or other mechanisms. 
-Meeting the ambitious 2030 agenda requires a paradigm shift from the traditional way of doing things. UNDP is committed to help countries achieve a fair and fast energy transition by investing in technologies that allow countries to substitute fossil fuels. Through the Climate Investment Platform, UNDP is supporting the Seychelles Energy Commission's initiative to make the adoption of renewable energy accessible to the population that would otherwise not be able to afford to do so. The technical assistance received through the Climate Investment Platform's SIDS Call for Proposals will support elements such as pre-feasibility studies, assessment of business models, and financial structure. The project from Seychelles is one of ten projects selected by the Climate Investment Platform.  -

Climate Action towards investing and supporting vulnerable economies contributes not only to SDG 13 but to other SDGs too. In Mauritius, achieving the Paris Agreement targets of limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius and striving to limit temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees, requires concerted action and investments across all sectors including transport, as defined in the country’s NDC targets.
-Modernising the public transport system in alignment with Mauritius' development goals
-The Mauritian economy requires a modern, resilient and low-carbon transport sector as its backbone. However, in recent years economic growth has enabled a gradual shift from public transport to private modes of transport and this has resulted in increased traffic congestion, GHG emissions, and pollution. As per data from National Land Transport Authority (NLTA), vehicle registrations have nearly doubled between 2010 and 2021, with growth driven primarily by personal cars.-Conversely, and because of increased demand for private modes of transport, the public bus transport fleet has decreased from 2,034 in December 2017 to 1,962 in June 2020, while average vehicle journeys per day have decreased from 8.8 in 2010 to less than 8 in 2019. This has led to several challenges such as (i) increased road traffic congestion and gridlocks, (ii) increased road accidents and casualties, and (iii) increased Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution. Mauritius’ bus fleet is considerably less fuel-efficient than it ought to be, and outdoor/ambient air pollution has become a key public health concern, particularly in urban areas.
-In response to these challenges, the Government aims to modernise the public transport system in alignment with Mauritius’ development goals including decarbonisation objectives, by attracting more citizens to use the public transport system. Buses, together with the Metro Express, form the principal modes of public transport in Mauritius. As of June 2021, there were 3,126 registered buses in Mauritius, of which about 2,000 were public transport buses.- - -Less is more: Investing in Sustainable Transport-The Covid-19 pandemic has been a disruptive event worldwide including in Mauritius, causing demand for public transport, in particular, to shrink. Without an integrated, modern, and low-carbon transport system, the demand will continue to shrink in Mauritius. Together with MetroExpress, investments in a public bus transport system will be critical to driving more travellers towards using public transport.-In 2014, the Ministry of Land Transport and Light Rail (MLTLR) introduced the Bus Modernization Programme, providing capital subsidies and exemption from VAT to public transport bus operators to modernize their fleets. The policy aimed to ensure that, by 2023, 75% of the country’s bus fleet would be less than 10 years old. The initiative, however, had limited success, due to: (i) insufficient capital subsidies, (ii) and newer semi low-floor buses having lower fuel efficiency than the older buses they replaced. More recently, Mauritius approved the Metro Express project in 2016, with the Phase 1 corridor (13 km) beginning full operations in January 2020, while Phase 2 is scheduled for completion by 2022.
-Globally, technological innovations and efficiency improvements have made low carbon electric buses viable. Investing in electric buses for public transport in Mauritius is critical to reduce overall fossil fuel import costs and air pollution. The Government has recognized this and extended its policy incentives to electric and hybrid buses too, and it has proposed to further enhance these incentives under a new budget announcement made in June 2021, while approving a '10-Year Electric Vehicle Integration Roadmap’. However, additional incentives and enabling policy/regulatory environment are needed.- - -Incentives to Promote Low-carbon Electric Public Bus Transport-Following a request from the Government of Mauritius in 2019, UNDP developed a Global Environment Facility (GEF-7) concept note for a ‘Promoting Low-carbon Electric Public Transport in Mauritius’ project. The objective is to modernise the public bus transport sector by establishing an enabling regulatory environment and providing financial incentives for public transport bus operators to replace 60 of their diesel buses with electric buses, and for the installation of 15 solar-powered charging stations for electric vehicles.-The project also aims to mainstream gender in the transport sector through training and capacity development initiatives designed to support women’s employment. The project also proposes measures to improve women’s safety on public transport buses, as a contribution to achieving an overall increase in access to safe public bus transport for women commuters.-From a climate perspective, the project is expected to directly reduce over 76,000 tons of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions by 2040, and indirectly reduce over 316,000 tons of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions by 2044.
-This is Only the Beginning....
-This GEF project is only the beginning. There is significant scope and opportunities to develop a larger investment program to scale up the baseline of the activities. Further opportunities exist for investments in the de-carbonisation of public transport bus fleets;  the expansion of the policy and regulatory framework to include taxis/ride-sharing fleets; the integration of vehicle fleets (buses, cars, etc.) in the tourism and corporate transport sectors; and e-commerce/logistics delivery fleets (light commercial vehicles, 2-wheelers).-Furthermore, proper conditions exist for the exploration of a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy. This may include mobilizing investments for bicycling and walking pathways and park-and-ride schemes at Multimodal Integration (MMI) transit hubs; and operationalising a Battery Recycling Facility, to further enable the transition to a sustainable development pathway for the transport sector.- ","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Sagar Gubbi,Blog post,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 13  Climate action,Mauritius,Anishta Heeramun,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,English"

The tourist industries of Small Island Developing States have been successful due to the attractiveness of their lagoons and beaches, and they owe much of this renown to an oftentimes underestimated natural resource: coral reefs. As global citizens celebrate World Tourism Day on 27 September 2021, it is important to highlight the importance of these underwater ecosystems, which are the hidden foundation of the tourism industry, and provide enormous value to island economies.-Coral reefs are the rainforests of the oceans. They are net sinks for carbon and also contribute to fix nitrogen. Home to over 4,000 species of fish alone, they are also a source of income, food, and medicine for humanity. The Republics of Mauritius and Seychelles host more than 2,653 km2 of diverse coral reefs which act as natural barriers for the coastal zones. Buffering the shorelines against waves, storms, and floods, coral reefs protect beaches and create ideal conditions for many sea-based recreational activities which are vital for the tourism industry of Small Island Developing States.-In Mauritius and Seychelles, where tourism accounted for around 12% of GDP and above 39% of GDP respectively in 2019, coral reefs are real economic assets. Estimates indicate that coral reefs account for USD 2.7 trillion per year in ecosystem service value. Annual benefits have been estimated at USD 3,500 per square kilometer derived from fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection. However, this figure is likely to be an underestimate, as coral reefs also protect the real-estate and livelihoods of around one billion people.
- -Main causes of coral reefs destruction
-During the three last decades, coral reefs have become the most threatened ecosystems on the planet. Globally, coral reefs have already lost 50% of their live hard coral cover between 1957 to 2007, and the need to protect them and preserve their services is greater than ever.-Climate change has emerged as one of the greatest threats to coral reefs. Even under modest scenarios of global warming (<1.5°C), between 70 to 90% of reef-building corals are predicted to die. In Mauritius, during the most recent coral bleaching event in 2016, sea-water temperatures rose above the average of 29oC, and 40 to 50% of the total live coral cover was impacted. The Seychelles, which has a total coral cover of around 1,690 km2, was not spared either as over 60% of sites experienced high or extreme bleaching in 2016, with a mortality rate of around 30%.-Human activities on land and at sea can also be major sources of stress for coral reefs. Overfishing and unsustainable fishing methods have disrupted the delicate ecological balance of coral reefs and caused direct harm to the integrity of their ecosystems. The tourism industry, which has brought increased volumes of waste and more intensive sea activities in the lagoons, has also played a role in the decline of coral reefs.- -The spread of tourist infrastructures along shorelines has also occasionally led to unsustainable coastal development. In some regions of Mauritius, the removal of mangroves or seagrass has deprived the lagoons of their natural filters altering the composition of seawater to the detriment of the coral reefs. Such changes in the water composition of lagoons can also come from inland human activities. Seawater quality can also be degraded by sediments, nutrients and pesticides - used in agriculture and other human activities - that are carried into the sea by rivers and directly impact the corals. 
-As living organisms, corals can also be affected by bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and there are also natural predators of corals. The Crown of Thorns Starfish (COT), a voracious coral predator, has caused much harm to corals around Mauritius and Seychelles. Overfishing of COTs predators and pollution are factors that can contribute to outbreaks of these animals.-The compounding effect of these stresses is not only a reduction of reef health but also a reduction in the resilience of reef communities to naturally recover. As corals disappear, so do fish and many other reef-dependent species. This directly impacts the fisheries industry and the livelihoods and food security of island communities. The decline of coral reefs also reduces the natural protection of lagoons against waves and storm surges, and thus affects the tourist industry and other infrastructures found along the coast. It is therefore essential that major local reef threats are mitigated if we are to give coral reefs a fighting chance of survival in the face of a changing global climate.-Coral Restoration through Innovation
-A global coordinated effort is required to develop targets and pathways for coral reef ecosystem recovery and adaptation while appropriate governance structure and policy framework are required to address needs at the local level.-The UNDP, with the support of the Adaptation Fund, has been at the forefront of increasing the resilience of coral reefs by improving institutional capacity and coral restoration efforts at national and regional levels.-Since 2020, with a grant of USD 10 M from the Adaptation Fund, the UNDP has been implementing the ‘Restoring Marine Ecosystem Services by Restoring Coral Reefs to Meet a Changing Climate Future’ project in the Republics of Mauritius and Seychelles.-The overall objective of this six-year regional project is to reduce the impact of climate change on local communities and coral reef-dependent economic sectors in the Republics of Mauritius and Seychelles, by implementing coral reef restoration with thermal tolerant corals as an adaptation to climate change. Under the project, the target is to restore approximately 2.5 hectares of coral reefs in Mauritius, 0.7 hectare in Rodrigues, and 2.5 hectares in Seychelles.
-At the regional level, a solid knowledge base on the best practices regarding coral reef restoration, with particular emphasis on the SIDS, will be developed. Genetic connectivity studies between selected corals from Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles will also be undertaken.-In line with the achievement of SDGs 3, 13, and 14, the project will ultimately contribute to (i) the reduction of risks from high-intensity storms, (ii) the protection of the tourism industries of both countries, and (iii) the enhancement of the value and sustainability of their coral reef fisheries.- -

Today the island, which has one of the most threatened island biodiversity, still hosts some of the most unique, rare, and threatened animals and plants on the planet, and they need to be protected. Through the recently launched GEF-UNDP Mainstreaming Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Prevention, Control and Management project, new measures have been set to protect these unique species from a major threat: Invasive Alien Species.-The arrival of human beings and its consequences for the biodiversity of the island-Mauritius was formed by underwater volcanic eruptions 8 million years ago. Animals and plants reached the shores of the island from surrounding landmasses by flying, swimming, “hitchhiking” across the sea on floating vegetation or by being carried by the wind. Isolated from their mainland relatives, these newcomers have evolved into distinct species now considered to be unique or “endemic” to the island.-With the arrival of human settlers, the natural resources of the island were exploited for settlement, agriculture and trade, leading to the decline of natural ecosystems and to the extinction of unique species such as the famous Dodo. From the beginning of colonization to our present times, people have also caused the deliberate or accidental introduction of foreign animals, plants and micro-organisms, which have in turn become threats to the endemic species. More than 1,675 plant species have been introduced in Mauritius, of which 20 have been identified as particularly aggressive invaders. The worst species include Chinese Guava, Privet and Liane cerf. These species out-compete native plants for space, light and nutrients, and quickly come to dominate the forest throughout the island. -Another pathway for IAS introduction in Mauritius is through Ballast Water and Biofouling. The previous National Invasive Alien Species Strategy and Action Plan (NIASSAP) 2009-2018 recognised ballast water as the most probable entry point for marine IAS into the national territory. Non-native marine species increased from 15 to 25 between 2009 and 2013, with ten of the new species being a cause for concern with respect to possible further spread and impact.- -Mauritius’ natural ecosystems and unique biodiversity at risk-IAS have contributed to the extinction of 100 native species in Mauritius. Today, they are the most serious threat to the island’s endemic biodiversity. In addition to numerous foreign plants, at least 21 introduced species of mammals, reptiles and mollusks are considered as invasive. The black rat, the brown rat, the Javanese macaque, the feral pig, the Javan deer, the goat and the wild cat are some of the invasive mammals introduced from the beginning of the colonization of the island.-More recent introductions include the Madagascar giant day gecko and the gold-dust day gecko which are threats for our endemic lizards, the Phelsuma and the Nactus. Alien species can also be found in Mauritian freshwater ecosystems with potential negative impacts. Rivers are invaded with introduced fish species such as the Poeciliidae and one Cichlidae.-A major threat to the economy, environment, and society-Coupled with human-induced land degradation, IAS contribute to the reduction of the ecosystem services provided by our native forests, affecting their contribution to economic development. The negative impact of IAS also touches the sugar industry and the agricultural sector, thus being a risk for food security. While the Aphthovirus is responsible for Food and Mouth Disease (FMD) in Livestock, pests such as fruit flies cause damage to fruits and vegetables. It is estimated that Rs 160 M of agricultural produce is lost annually due to fruit flies.-Some IAS can also be vectors of diseases for both wildlife and humans. Crude examples are the circovirus psittacine beak and feather disease which affects our endemic Echo parakeet and Pink Pigeon; and Chikungunya, a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes.- -Consolidating the response to IAS-Despite serious threats posed by IAS to the biodiversity, health, and economy in Mauritius, actions undertaken to manage their impact have been reactive and piecemeal, and driven by the perceived needs of individual sectors. However, IAS should not be considered as the responsibility of a single Ministry or Department, as the problems they cause cut across many economic sectors, including public and private stakeholders. As with other aspects of biodiversity conservation, addressing this specific problem requires efficient collaboration between the relevant institutions. With the increase in the number of vessels and visitors arriving in the Republic of Mauritius, public and private stakeholders need to work together to tackle this already challenging issue and prevent it from worsening.-The GEF-UNDP Mainstreaming Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Prevention, Control and Management project, aims at safeguarding globally significant biodiversity in vulnerable ecosystems through the prevention, control, and management of invasive alien species (IAS) in the Republic of Mauritius. Three impact pathways have been identified in the project to achieve this objective:
-1. Creating the policy and institutional frameworks needed to secure ecosystem goods and services under pressure from IAS. This includes the setting up of enabling environments (policies, institutional coordination) for mainstreaming IAS prevention, control and management.-2. Establishing a multi-tier strategy for effective tackling of IAS - encompassing improved preventive measures at points of entry into the country and inter-Islands, early detection, and rapid response programmes to eradicate new incursions. The strategy also includes improved capacity to upscale proven methodologies for managing IAS on a landscape level. -3. Up-to-date information for raising public awareness and enhancing understanding of the importance of IAS programmes for protecting biodiversity, ecosystems, the economy, and livelihoods. It ensures that knowledge management supports monitoring, assessment and learning and forms the basis for adaptive project implementation, achievement of results, impacts, and upscaling of experiences in the Republic of Mauritius and in the region. This will ensure that the interventions of the project inform and influence the behaviours of a wider IAS constituency.- -Finding a sustainable and holistic approach for both terrestrial and marine ecosystem conservation is a must if we are to preserve them for future generations. As the National Invasive Alien Strategy for the Republic of Mauritius (2009-2018) document states, “If this challenge is not met, then increasing mobility, greater volumes of trade and the growing complexity of transport networks are sure to result in increasingly severe IAS impacts in the Republic of Mauritius in the near future. Business as usual – an uncoordinated, reactive and ad hoc approach - will prove to be much more costly to the Mauritian economy, environment and society than the coordinated and comprehensive approach outlined in this Strategy.”-

-The African Continental Free trade Agreement (AfCFTA) has the potential to lift the human development of Africa’s 1.3 billion people on several fronts. While the benefits are many, including 14 million additional jobs within manufacturing alone by 2025, increase in wages by at least 10 percent, and reducing poverty by more than 60 percent, a key success indicator we must consider in assessing the value addition of the agreement is the promise to uplift those at high risk of exclusion from the envisaged benefits. According to UN Women, African women are a key constituency that face exclusion and marginalisation in both the public and private spheres, including employment and access to finance. A study by OECD reveals that the interaction of trade policies with the local economy can potentially entrench gender inequalities if not approached in tandem with domestic policy to support women’s economic empowerment. For instance, the burden of domestic activity, difficulty in access to resources and several other impediments reduce the chances of women taking advantage of the growing market opportunities compared to men.-The gendered barriers to women’s development must be tackled head on – if the AfCFTA is to achieve its overall aims. On a positive note, Article 3(e) of the AfCFTA explicitly recognises the significance of gender equality and seeks to “promote and attain sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development, gender equality and structural transformation”. It also seeks to facilitate job creation and promote greater competitiveness among micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The upcoming protocol on women is a testament to this commitment.  -Closing Gender Gaps Across the Value Chain makes Business Sense
-In Mauritius, sex-disaggregated data on women-owned and led businesses is scant. However, a 2020 pulse survey by Business Mauritius and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on businesses in Mauritius revealed that only 23 percent of businesses involved in exports were headed by women. The survey is, however, not fully representative as it excludes women’s engagement across the value chain such as in textile manufacturing, a sector which, since the 1980s, thrived under export-oriented policies but in recent years witnessed considerable decline, struggling to increase productivity levels. There is evidence showing that export growth, linked to the textile manufacturing industry did increase the share of female employment but it is to be noted that women are more often involved in low-value-added activities. This includes the production and sale of food, handicrafts and souvenirs, similarly to other countries of the African continent, where women tend to operate in the lower rungs of value chains. This finding also resonates with the OECD analysis of gender inequality in global value chains.-The urgent need to empower women is backed by a wealth of evidence from the human development indicators, which illustrates what Mauritius stands to lose in development gains. According to the 2021 global gender gap report, Mauritius ranks 118th out of 156 countries in economic participation and opportunity for women, only ahead of 10 countries in Africa. The UNDP’s Global Human Development Report 2020 also revealed that the country lost 34.7 percent of its human development ranking due to gender inequality, owing in part to a low labour force participation rate of 45.2 percent for women compared to 72 percent for men.- -Quick Wins to Address Bottlenecks to Women’s Participation
-The UNDP has partnered with the Government of Mauritius and the private sector to undertake national consultations on the AfCFTA Protocol on Women in Trade. This engagement is based on a cooperation framework between UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa and the AfCFTA Secretariat. Through this partnership and other consultative platforms, Mauritius can promote opportunities to benefit women through the Trade Protocol by: First, bringing together women entrepreneurs to share experiences on the gendered barriers and challenges to entering the African market, and to articulate the priority support needed to boost their participation. Second, consolidating these findings and enabling the formulation of national policy positions to inform the Action Plan of the Mauritius Africa strategy.  Third, enhancing export competitiveness by expanding the pilot Africa Warehousing Scheme (AWS) to subsidize rental and administrative costs of warehouses in select countries with a focus on additional incentives for women-owned and led enterprises. Fourth, updating key policies and laws to promote effective participation of women in gainful economic activity.
-Now is the time for building inroads to markets in mainland Africa. Mauritius can be a first mover by capitalising on the trade opportunities through deliberate expansion of access for women.

No, it is not plastic nor paper but food waste. Food waste forms up to 40-51 % of the waste in the Kingdom followed by paper, cardboard, plastics and others.  - -UNDP understands that tackling food waste in each country is unique as each case has its own characteristics.-(Read more about: How cities can fight food loss and waste and How do you light a light bulb with food waste?)- -UNDP Accelerator Labs from all over the world are building on that understanding. For example, the Accelerator Lab in Syria started exploring a journey to move “From organic waste to food security: Building on nature-based frugal innovations”, Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated a food waste innovation challenge, and Ukraine supported a local solution that enhanced a botanical garden through coffee waste. In the Saudi Accelerator Lab, we are starting a journey to explore the complexity of food waste in the context of Saudi Arabia and understand its uniqueness, to join the effort in tackling food waste challenge locally with support from our global network.-The decision to choose this frontier challenge was also driven by the influence of the country office as they see the potential in this area with current and aspired partnerships.- -According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), “an estimated 1/3 of all food produced globally is lost or goes to waste”. Among the biggest food wasters in the world is in the GCC, where Saudi Arabia is one of the highest.-Accordingly, the Saudi Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, Abdulrahman AlFadley has called for joint efforts to end food waste. Approximately 33% of food is wasted in the Kingdom according to a study by the Saudi Grains Organization conducted in 2019.- -In line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 and efforts to reduce food waste, the Saudi Arabia Accelerator Lab wanted to dive deeper into this phenomenon to better understand who are the players in this ecosystem and where are the areas that could be further explored to find innovative ways to tackle food waste.- -As a way to move ahead, the Lab met with a number of stakeholders. This included: the private sector (large scale as well as a start-up), non-profit organizations, and academia. One of the stakeholders we met with stated:-“Moving from oil to non-oil: This field is a generating sector and has a lot of potential”.-From these meetings, we have gathered a range of insights that have been summarized below:- - - -In conclusion, food waste is a huge challenge but if we think and work collectively, we will be able to find opportunities and innovative solutions that reduce waste, maximize use, and eliminate possible poor nutrition and hunger issues. This will require the collaboration of all actors in the system, as one stakeholder had put it:-“This is a complex problem and there is a need to sit together to find solutions both locally and in the Gulf region.”- -You can find more details about how the Accelerator Lab is engaged in exploring food systems and waste here: https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org/content/acceleratorlabs/en/home/blogs/Food.html- -We cannot be more excited to continue this journey as it is unfolding.

UNDP had partnered with the Riyadh Urban Observatory (RUO) that works under the umbrella of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC), that is tasked with developing sustainable urban monitoring systems which supports comprehensive planning across the city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.- -UNDP Resident Representative, Dr. Adam Bouloukos, mentioned the long-lasting partnership with RCRC dates back to 2009. He stressed  that UNDP partnerships have further gained momentum with Vision 2030. He said “although this workshop is one component of the program UNDP has with RUO and RCRC, it embodies the qualities that UNDP brings such as knowledge transfer, best practice, deeper perspective on SDG and the spirit of working together as one team”.  He then continued to mention ""UNDP is not here only to deliver projects but to partner to implement vision 2030. UNDP teams work within organisations and institutions to build capacities, transfer knowledge, deliver results and make a positive impact ""- -The training aimed to enhance the RCRC staff's knowledge and skills and has been designed for more efficient operation of the RUO database and development of indicators for effective monitoring of the Riyadh Strategy and Riyadh Sustainability Strategy. In addition the Support to Riyadh Urban Observatory project current phase is aimed to evaluate the results of the institutional and individual capacity development through a participatory process, and to identify and address immediate training priorities so as to strengthen institutional and individual capacity to enable RCRC team to proficiently review, develop, align, apply, and monitor and report on RUO indicators in line with the strategic objectives, programmes and initiatives of the new Riyadh Strategy and Riyadh Sustainability Strategy, as well as national development frameworks (e.g., Vision 2030, National Spatial Strategy 2030) and international development frameworks — in particular, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).- -The UNDP Sustainable Development Advisor, Nadine Bitar, leading the training said “Evidence-Based Policies facilitates decision making for implementing Vision 2030 while contributing to KSA commitments to Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement. The Workshop presented a comprehensive perspective on how Innovative monitoring, reporting and evaluating frameworks align policies, programs and strategies with Vision2030  while leaving no one behind and contributing to the SDG's.”- -Therefore, the training agenda focused on monitoring and evaluating for Sustainable Urban Development feeding into evidence-based decision making supporting for RCRC. The training program — taking urban sustainability indicators as a central focus — provided tools for monitoring and evaluation of the urban dimension of city strategies and programs specially focusing on remedying the challenge to link back to the policy cycle. The conceptual framework of the program was built around Evidence-Based Policies for sustainable urban development in relation to the different dimensions and linkages of SDG11 in relation to other interlinked SDGs. Such Interlinkages were further explained in relation to Riyadh new City Strategy and Riyadh sustainability strategy – both targeting 2030 as a major milestone.- -In that respect, the training also explored the future of urban observatories in relation to digital smart technologies as a tool, co-creation of studies and reports as a process, and urban intelligence as a new area. In addition, the training included quick snapshots on the advanced monitoring and evaluation tools used in cities to pave the way for urban observatories for the future.- -The training objectives were:- -The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is supporting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC), and its Riyadh Urban Observatory (RUO) as a part of the national efforts to improve the urban sector in Saudi Arabia, and in realizing the Urban Vision and Saudi Vision 2030.",[],

-If the second main source of animal protein for a population of 7.977 million people (in 2020) is coming from poultry products such as eggs, and meat, and that the domestic production cannot meet 50% of that demand, then, this protein demand gap can either create an ideal environment for exploitation by poultry farmers or can act as a catalyst to provoke actions towards closing the gap sustainably.-Now poultry production is a common practice in Sierra Leone that contributes significantly to enhancing the livelihood, and economic and socio-cultural well-being of many local farmers. And according to researchers, there is a vast potential for the poultry sector to thrive in Sierra Leone with the capacity to meet and even exceed the local demand as it is already the largest livestock reared in Sierra Leone[1]. Again, we know that for this sector to thrive as forecasted, certain fundamental pillars must be in place for an ideal ecosystem which is not the case as there are several challenges along the value chain that limit this expansion. FAO in Sierra Leone, like other partners, has been working with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and poultry farmers nationwide to strengthen weak areas within the local ecosystem from the initial point of acquiring quality day-old chicks for egg production as support given to vulnerable farmers in the rural areas across the country to increase their income and as well as improve their nutrition status. In this blog, we will be focusing on one of the major challenges faced by small-scale commercial farmers and explore how innovation, especially locally driven solutions, can contribute to business and national development.-In recent years there has been a growing interest in commercial poultry enterprise (CPE) investment however, up to 50% of these CPEs are considered small-scale farmers with stock of between 1 to 1000 birds. And one of the major deterrents to the growth of these small-scale commercial farmers is the importation of day-old chicks to sustain the production cycle due to the unavailability of the functional hatchery in the country.  -This periodic restocking process also entails its levels of risk and inconveniences, especially for small-scale commercial farmers who, because of restrictions such as minimum order policy by suppliers and limited knowledge and exposure to foreign transactions, these farmers must process restock requests through large farms that serve as aggregators.-This process must be planned in detail, as orders are to be submitted in time for allocations to be made and the first dose of vaccines to be administered to the chicks before they are airfreighted to Sierra Leone for immediate transport to their destination. During this process, mortality occurs, which is an additional loss borne by the farmers. This cycle needs to be broken for small-scale commercial farmers to grow and progressively reduce the high dependency on the importation of day-old chicks.-Small-scale commercial poultry farmers have been trying to address this issue of importation of day-old chicks for quite some time now. For a brief while, a handful of farmers succeeded in importing hatcheries which enabled them to increase their stock significantly, but this was not sustainable because of limited knowledge in doing routine maintenance and operation of these machines, which eventually made them unfit for use.-In the interest of finding a sustainable option to reduce production cost on small-scale commercial poultry farmers, especially for day-old chicks, UNDP, through the local innovation grassroots mapping mechanism identified a disruptive solution that might have huge impact potential. After a series of engagements with FAO and other key partners such as Limkokwing and Njala Universities, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI), UNDP provided prototype development funds for the building of Sierra Leone’s first rechargeable hatchery, a unit that can accommodate 32 eggs.-For this maiden test, the prototype was deployed at a poultry farm in Kono to assess performance. From crossbreeding a local breed hen with an improved breed cock, 19 eggs were laid and introduced into the unit for hatching. After 4 sets of candling, 10 eggs were identified as fertile, and 10 hatched successfully. These chicks were transferred into the brooding chamber. -It was observed that:-With this first experiment cycle completed, further investments can now be made to expand the scope of the second cycle to include between 4 to 10 local small-scale commercial farmers to monitor the impact on productivity levels over a specific period. Now assuming this second cycle of experiment results are successful, then;-On the other hand, the young innovator becomes a manufacturer who can;-So, our path to scale is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a tailormade, considering the local context need, product, and producer readiness to take on the market. That is why our new approach is a pacesetter for other partners not just to identify these young innovators with high impact solutions and showcase them but also further guide them through the various stages of the product development cycle, equipping them with entrepreneurship and digital skills to prepare them for their entrepreneurship journey.-The possibilities for this solution and others mapped along the poultry value chain are endless that can contribute to locally addressing the pain points within this ecosystem, allowing increased productivity and growth for small-scale commercial farmers.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Africa,Innovation,Goal 1  No poverty,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Sierra Leone,Solutions Mapping,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

The Sierra Leone Multi Indicator Cluster Survey (Statistics SL, 2017) reports that there has been a gradual increase in national water supply coverage from 57% in 2010 to 67% in 2017 (approximately an additional 1.375 million people had access)-UNDP, like other development partners, continues to support the Government of Sierra Leone to increase water supply coverage to unserved areas not covered by the national grid supply. We are doing this by deploying stand-alone innovative and tailor-made solutions nationwide such as the construction of 5 spring box systems, drilling of 160 boreholes with solar-powered water pumps, installation of 6 rainwater harvest systems and gravity water systems providing access to safe and clean water to over 20,000 people living in marginalized communities.-There are also the underserved areas where the supply of pipe-borne water from the national grid is rationed, for example in Western Area. This condition is influenced by several factors being overpopulation due to rural-urban migration that increases the demand for water and overstretched systems with weak infrastructure, which continue to limit expansion. To adapt to this reality, inhabitants have also evolved by installing personal reservoirs, in the form of plastic storage tanks of varying colours and capacities based on the extent of the need, to help regulate water supply to meet their daily household needs.-Installed on rooftops and on standalone towers, which is the most common in the city, these storage tanks have become valuable assets for households over the years, as they are durable and built to withstand weather conditions. They have been very instrumental in reducing the tension caused by water shortages within these underserved communities but has also created an added water management burden on inexperienced consumers.   -The household water tanks are usually opaque and elevated to increase pressure as the water flow is gravity driven. As a result of this elevated positioning, monitoring water levels become a problem for most users. For instance, a very common practice to know when the tank is full is when it overflows, which can go on for hours if attendants are not attentive. Another usual occurrence is for water to suddenly stop flowing from the tanks due to wrong water level estimations that are informed/ guided by the tank’s sound when tapped or opening of the cover to gauge levels using ladders every time.  -Hopefully, that will be the old way of doing this, as UNDP has funded the development of a prototype system known as the Dainkeh Aqua-Tronics System, an automated device designed to take the inconveniences away with zero water wastage.-A one-time installation of the various components of the device was done to 1) regulate the inflow of water into two 3000 liter capacity tanks, including the monitoring of water levels inside the well, which served as the water source, and 2) Provide accurate water level readings for users without the need of going to the tanks. This water management system served a 3-floor building with 12 permanent residents and day occupants of up to 80 students, as it is also occupied by a vocational school for three (3) months. -At the end of the 3 months of testing, the following were observed:
-1. The system has an indicator board installed at the ’ser's desired location for ease of monitoring. This board should reflect the status of water content within the respective enclosures.-Random documented measurement tests were jointly conducted with users to verify indicator readings.-2. It was observed that the entire water management process was automated with no need for human intervention after installation. The refilling process occurred automatically with the thresholds for the auto-refill subject to the user’s preference. For this experiment refill threshold was set for the 25% mark for the tanks.-3. From tests conducted with occupants, it was also observed that the indicator board design to communicate water levels was flexible enough to cater to both literate (both light & % readings) and non-literate (light indicators) monitors.-4. Since installation, there were no reported interruptions due to systems failure or maintenance requests.-5. The system requires an energy source, and for this experiment, electricity supply from the national grid and generator was used to be fully functional and display accurate readings. From closing interviews with users and monitors, it was clear that Aquatronics is an efficient solution that gives you one less thing to worry about. With technical and financial support from UNDP, the innovator Ibrahim Dainkeh has now developed a product that has been tested and is market ready.

The development of skills and knowledge is undeniably a major instrument for promoting decent work in the informal economy. People who work in the informal sector mostly have limited access to formal education; profiles in terms of the years spent in education suggest quite low levels of training (Fluitman 1989; Lautier 2000).-Eighty six percent of Sierra Leone’s workforce are in the informal sector, mostly engaged in petty trading and agriculture. In a recent UNCDF project with the Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation, the mapping of Sierra Leone’s digital and entrepreneur ecosystem revealed that 70 percent of entrepreneurs interviewed were doing business only for survival, that is to take care of themselves and their families. Very few businesses cited business growth as part of their plans for starting a business. Reasons include lack of business development skill training, lack of financial and digital literacy and limited access to finance. Over 50 percent of entrepreneurs interviewed cited access to and availability of affordable finance as the main challenge to the growth of their businesses. For 65 percent of the businesses, the major source of start-up capital was their personal savings. Other common sources are loans and gift from family and friends.-In the quest to address the challenges and encourage business growth among entrepreneurs, UNDP and UNCDF partnered with the Institute of Development and Humanitarian Assistance (IDHA) in a “Capacity building for entrepreneurs in Sierra Leone” project aimed at empowering entrepreneurs especially women. The joint SDG funded project aims at improving economic opportunities for entrepreneurs through trainings and access to affordable financial services and products. The project contributes to SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 5 (Gender equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities).  -Initiated in September 2021, the project will support 10,000 beneficiaries from four districts in Sierra Leone by June 2022. Some of the entrepreneurs were selected among the beneficiaries of the Programme “Safety Net for Women Traders Programme” implemented by UNDP in collaboration with the Mano River Union and, the Women Cross Border Traders’ Union. Other beneficiaries in the country’s capital, Freetown were selected with recommendation from the Women Traders Association of Freetown.-The trainings are targeted mostly at women groups and associations in selected market centers and communities. To date over 5000 entrepreneurs mostly women have benefited from the training. Five hundred of the entrepreneurs have also been identified for coaching and mentorship aimed at closing the gaps identified with the entrepreneurs during the general training. The training includes record keeping, savings, setting and achieving goals, business planning and risk management. In addition, trainees are linked to financial services providers after they have been taken through financial and digital literacy sessions so they can access credit to grow their businesses.-During the project implementation period, businesses of beneficiaries will be monitored and evaluated to assess the level of growth and progress after the training, coaching and mentorship and linkage to financial service providers. Stay tuned to read more on this project and how these women entrepreneurs were able to make use of their new skills.

However, with the rise in water levels, the southern regions of the delta are becoming less cultivation friendly. Dr. A F M Jamal Uddin, a professor of the Department of Horticulture at Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, has made progress in addressing the challenge with the use of hydroponics. According to the professor, the offsetting of the associated cost of the method can open possibilities for wide commercial usage.-In 1998, scientists at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute conducted the first study on the meteorological and water potential of hydroponic farming in this country. In 2007, the study of hydroponic methods tailored to the climate of Bangladesh began with tomatoes, capsicum, lettuce, and strawberries. Another year later, in 2008, the team additionally experimented with cucumbers, marigolds and eggplants, and in 2009 dwarf beans, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli and chrysanthemums. By 2012 the company  produced tomatoes, capsicum, lettuce, strawberries, beans, cauliflower and cabbages. -Sierra Leone a country located on the West Coast of Africa is also known to have arable land and tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The wet season usually starts in May and ends in November, and is characterized by torrential rainfalls and high humidity. The dry season  normally begins in December and ends in April, which includes harmattan, when cool, dry winds blow in from the Sahara Desert (changes in this weather partterns have aready been observed).-And as a result of this routine change in weather conditions, agricultural productivity levels also fluctuate. During the rains, farmers produce more as irrigation becomes easier and falls significantly during the dries. This instability contributes to widening the gap between local production and consumption, making food commodity one of Sierra Leone’s biggest import.  It is reported that 80% of food commodities consumed in the country are imported, and the country continues to spend over $240 million annually on the import of rice alone[1]. -Researchers over the years have been exploring ways and means to regulate and increase agricultural productivity, which includes establishing an all-year-round food production mechanism to help meet the needs of the current national population without adversely affecting the environment.-Our Tested  Solution -Hydroponics is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture where soil is replaced with substitute materials to support the plant's roots. Crops grow directly in nutrient-rich aqueous solvents. While there are multiple approaches to design hydroponic systems,in essence, it is a soil-less cultivation mechanism. -The Sierra Leone Experiment-UNDP Sierra Leone brought together a team of technical experts in Agriculture and Innovation to co-design the experiment, earmark specific challenge(s) that this solution can address, determining which of the SDGs the proposed solution contributes to identifying success/ failure indicators. The UNDP Accelerator deep dives with Agriculture Innovators  - DSTI-As the proposed solution promotes indoor gardening amongst other benefits, a sample design of the indoor unit with funding from UNDP was built and installed at a hotel in Bo City, where the unit was monitored, and data was collected daily.            Crisp Head Batavian Blonde de Paris Lettuce was nursed and grown to maturity under three (3) months, undergoing six (6) different stages. The Batavian Blonde de Paris has very crispy and sweet leaves. It is a type in between regular butterhead and iceberg lettuce. The leaves are compared to those of the Batavia lettuce.-The germination process was conducted outside the enclosure in a germination tray to provide an appropriate balance between the moisture and heat necessary for seeds to sprout. A tissue paper was used as a growing medium for germination and was placed at the bottom of the container and slightly wet with distilled water of pH 7.1. A slightly moist and heat conducive condition was created for germination to occur. -Key Outcomes-After sharing all data collected by the Sierra Leone Team  with the Bangladesh Lab Team, including engaging in series of exchange sessions, we were able to identify the outcomes of this maiden experiment.-1) Soil grown Crisp Head Batavian Blonde de Paris Lettuce takes between 60 to 70 days to grow to full maturity, it was observed that the lettuce within the unit matured in 42 days indicating an increased growth rate of aproximately 35% with height and length of roots longer than average lettuce grown in Sierra Leone.-2) Absence of weeds and other soil-borne pests.-3) Water-savings was also recorded with better control over nutrient and oxygen culminating to increased crop quality, higher yields with minimal use of land space. -Now, with sea levels rising in the case of Bangladesh and change in weather conditions in the case of Sierra Leone threatening the traditional soil-based  way of farming, reducing productivity at every turn and hindering each country’s drive to achieving food security by 2030, hydroponic technique needs to be considered/promoted (Hydroponics system in Bangladesh, based on floating gardens, has been recognized by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) for innovation, sustainability, and adaptability) for these reasons:-Both Country Accelerator Labs intends to share knowledge and collaborate with Government partners particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Insitiutes and Universities to explore means of  introducing and integrating hydroponics farming methods extensively in 2022.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Innovation,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Sierra Leone,South-South cooperation,Solutions Mapping,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,English,Accelerator Labs"

According to Sustainable Energy for ALL (SEforALL)2021, the national electrification rate is approximately 26 percent with approximately 6 percent accounting for access in rural areas. It is estimated that only five of the 16 District Headquarter Towns are partially supplied by a combination of small diesel units and mini hydropower plants. The electrification rate in the vast rural areas of the country is almost zero. This makes increasing the generation of electricity and improving the transmission and distribution network a national priority for the Government of Sierra Leone.-With an emphasis on exploring renewable power supply options, solar powered mini grids are being installed by development partners in selected rural areas to support the Government efforts in meeting global commitments. The Government continues to also encourage private sector investment in the energy sector to amplify electricity coverage. However, such interventions are capital intensive and there lies the issue of striking the balance between accessibility and affordability. Nevertheless, there is   a huge potential for renewable energy generation options to thrive within this sector.-That is why, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sierra Leone continues to engage local innovators who understand the local implications and importance of energy/electricity and have devised alternative means that respond to their personal but community challenge. These local solutions if scaled up, could also contribute to “lighting-up Sierra Leone” -an option that Government partners and UNDP Accelerator Lab investigates with keen interest to weigh the potential.-Recently, UNDP brought together experts within the Energy Sector, including Innovation, Academia, Rural Development and Environment Specialists into the creative space of two young innovators to listen to their thoughts about energy generation and the alternatives they have designed. The innovators pitched concept of their energy solutions, how it works, share results of preliminary tests, and showcase how the proposed solution will contribute to national and global goals to light up the world, one community at a time.-Jeremiah Thoronka made a virtual presentation of his Optim Energy solution, a hybrid system that uses a piezoelectric device to harnesses energy from heat and vibrations and a backup solar system, all of which create less impact on the environment compared to petroleum products or charcoal, two among the largest source of energy sources in the country. The Optim energy device uses a digital technology that facilitates a two-way smart communication system between the production point and the users, and its smart grid system is made up of sensing materials to facilitate energy efficiency along the transmission lines.  -Mamadu Nulador Bah presented his first version prototype of his Eco-friendly fuel free generator as a reasonable alternative for powering up homes and communities. An eco-friendly generator that is not powered by fossil fuel or solar energy, fumeless and silent, with the capacity to provide 24hours power supply.-It was an enriching experience as the exchanges, contributions and alternative viewpoints brought forward by experts drawn from their wealth of experience in diverse areas resulted in setting the framework for the respective experiments. UNDP will be allocating funds for the development of the various prototypes that will be deployed and tested between 3 and 6 months during which specific data will be collected that will inform the final results of the experiments.-At this point, determining success or failure is a secondary matter. What is key is how we start learning from these short span experiments, what works, what doesn’t and understanding why. For those that will work and demonstrates a true potential to increase access to electricity, the UNDP Accelerator Lab will recommend to partners for scale up investments to accelerate impact/growth/expansion. Eventually, this approach will canvas a simple model of how development experts can harness the benefits of locally designed innovations but also contribute to strengthen the innovation ecosystem.-This is a journey that UNDP is determined to take with young innovators as they explore the length and breadth of their capabilities. More reason why UNDP activated the 2030 Toll-free line for innovation reporting and inquiries. It doesn’t matter where the innovators are or what projects they’re working on, the Accelerator Lab wants to know and will rather work with them, connecting them to over 100 other innovators   across the country to strengthen their network and partnership as they innovate for a better life quality of life.","['Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Africa,Blog post,Goal 13  Climate action,partnerships,UNDP Donor Partners,Design Thinking,Sierra Leone,Energy,English,Accelerator Labs"

Yet, the emergence of Covid-19 is changing the story.-Following the 2019 edition of the Social Good Summit, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab and its partners planned on 2020 being a transformational year in the format for organizing the event. We hoped on having mini regional competitions before having a national grand finale event, with representatives from all regions. This was a necessary strategy in continuing our drive to take innovative thinking to the rural areas and to reach the last mile. However, Covid-19 had other plans and we were set with the challenge of organizing the event with little to no physical human interaction. As a result, the 7th edition of the Social Good Summit was an unintended experiment!-The Covid-19 pandemic therefore provided not the best moments but, an ideal opportunity for the Lab to start the process of digitizing the largely paper-based format and migrate the competition to an online platform. This was timely as it led to the Lab working with the Ministry of Youth Affairs (MoYA) to upgrade the youth Ministry’s National Youth Forum website to a web-based mobile app that operates as a one-stop shop for all youth activities in Sierra Leone. This online drive could be seen as hamstringing our attempt to reach the last mile due to limited internet connectivity and poor smart phone penetration in rural areas, however it’s a sign of the looming future and Sierra Leone will ultimately have to adjust accordingly to be part of the “new normal”. The 2020 final event was also not the usual grand occasion where we invite 300-500 guests to witness the innovators pitching to a panel of judges who selects the winners.  The 2020 event placed panel of judges and the pitchers in a pre-recorded televised event and was also expanded to include a youth impact competition to run alongside the youth innovation competition. The later was driven by the (MoYA) in its efforts to recognize and celebrate young people who have in diverse ways contributed to their communities outside the scope of innovation with the title of National Youth Ambassadors. These Ambassadors are to be a source of inspiration and advocates within their communities and peers.   -The theme for the 2020 SGS is ‘Innovate for a better Sierra Leone’, translated into our local parlance as ‘Inovate 4 Bette Salone’. This theme couldn’t be better suited to the current situation we find ourselves in the world today with the Covid-19 pandemic. We need to create new ways to recover and improve government service delivery in priority areas including health, education, and finance, to ensure we build our nation back better and see the country we want.-As mentioned earlier, 2020 SGS competition had a regional flavour. All five regions in Sierra Leone, North, North-West, South, East and West had the opportunity to send one male and one female participant to challenge in the final pitch event. Applications were screened per region with the best male and female innovators selected to represent and compete in their respective gender categories for top prize winner and runner-up. Application forms were received through email, WhatsApp, web application and hard copies at identified regional offices around the country. Hard copies applications were drastically reduced compared to the previous years as many young people took the opportunity to use the online web application and social media. Over 150 applications were received for both the innovation and impact competitions with 80% of the applicants using the new media for their submissions.
-Before the final event, the finalists were invited to attend a 4-day bootcamp to prepare them for their final pitch, which was   recorded for airing on television on the final day of the bootcamp. The 4-day Bootcamp was also a   transitional period where the 10 final candidates under the innovation component  were coached and given tips on how to present their pitch,  provide information that Judges could  be looking out for composure, respond to questions among others.  Some of the final candidates were new to pitching and needed some hand holding to understand what is expected from them during the finals.-The four prize winners of the innovation competition-1.       Top Female Prize winner:-Yembeh Kargbo – Western Region (Beads fashion design e.g jewellery and accessories)-2.       Runner-up Female:-Fatu Tarawallie – Northern Region (Waste plastic into women’s accessories)-3.       Top Male Prize winner:-Samuel Mattia – Southern Region (Hydroponics Agriculture)-4.       Runner-up Male:-Martin Dainbaquee – Eastern Region (Locally made poultry hatchery)-The UNDP Accelerator Labs focus will not just be on handing out cash prizes, but to also work with our clusters, collaborate with other innovation labs/hubs,   and relevant stakeholders to work with and mentor these young budding innovators/entrepreneurs by providing entrepreneurial support and a ‘safe’ space to test the viability of inventions and ideas before potentially growing and scaling them up. -Prize winners of the previous summit award in Sierra Leone have gone on to contribute remarkably towards development in the country. Among others, these contributions include, deploying an upgrade design of the traditional water well that has an inbuilt water filtration system providing safe water for domestic use in communities. This young innovator was the male runner-up prize winner in 2019, and as a result of the value the solution brings to communities, he was awarded a contract to install more of his design in 10 slum communities. Another noteworthy solution that was experimented by the Accelerator Lab was the auto irrigation system to encourage all year-round farming in determination to increase production and productivity within the agricultural sector. Remotely controlled, this innovation brings added value to our traditional practice whilst reducing water wastage and labour constraints.-In 2021, we plan to build further on the achievements of 2020. The accelerator lab’s frontier challenge will be looking at the problem of youth unemployment, focusing on how innovation and entrepreneurship can be a means of job creation for young people. Our approach will be strengthening of innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem and supporting young aspiring innovators with product development, entrepreneurship training and access to finance (e.g. through crowdfunding) for the establishment of viable enterprises.  -Meet the first cohort of National Youth Ambassadors selected from all regions in Sierra Leone.-1. Northern Region – Alusine Lulu Bangura (Youth advocate and entrepreneur)-2. North-West Region – Isatu Moses (Social change campaigns and livelihood interventions)-3. Western Area - Benson Kandeh (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene-WASH)-4. Southern Region – Aminata F. Kandeh (Fish farming)-5. Eastern Region– Osman Yaah (Rural renewal energy)-

During our mapping campaign and even with the many speed bumps they had to run over,  the team met with over 50  innovators in very hard to reach communities such as Mongor and Mattru Jong and far-flung village like Rosenor to conduct one-to-one interviews and gathered more information and insights about their solutions. This field visit exercise brought a lot of relevant information to light regarding each individual solution. Three key noticeable things were:-1.       A lot-about 85% of the prototypes were of a poor standard in terms of design. Innovators used scrap materials and rudimentary tools available in their communities, which made the prototypes a death trap. This proved problematic for the lab to run adequate experiments on some promising prototypes due to safety concerns.-2.       Most of the innovators’ mindset was to create prototypes for events and competition, applying for multiple cash challenges with no thought given to how their prototypes can be turned into a Minimum Viable Product and marketed as a viable business to the public.-3.       Following on from point 2, there is also a lack of national infrastructure within the innovation and technology ecosystem to support young innovators who are aspiring entrepreneurs with budding ideas, designs and/or prototypes,  and are passionate about  creating jobs for others rather than seeking one in a country with very limited job opportunities.-Even in the wake of Covid-19, colleagues at our Accelerator Lab gave their heart to a UNDP course and leverage on a glaring life-changing opportunity,  partnering with the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology (LUCT) to run a 6 months (July-December, 2020) online and limited in-person (due to the Pandemic restrictions)  Design and Entrepreneurship Training for  20 (8 females; 12 males) high potential innovators to build their capacity, coach and mentor them. A private sector telecommunication company, Africell, provided the students with data services to ensure smooth running of the online sessions. The course content was designed to cater for their various levels and  the different educational background of the innovators, as they were from all over Sierra Leone (Freetown – 8; Western Rural – 3; Kono – 2; Pujehun – 1; Bo – 1; Port Loko – 1; Moyamba – 1; Kailahun – 1; Bombali – 2). -The content of the course covered basic, intermediate, and advance levels of entrepreneurship training with topics covering conceptualizing and idea, information technology for business, communication and creative thinking skills, financial literacy, computer aided design and business planning. The course also provided unique selling points for the innovators to network with fellow trainees with the potential to forms partnership to set up successful enterprise, work with mentors with practical industry experience and LUCT has a ready incubator facility to provide the innovators working area for building and breaking.-“The Design and Entrepreneurship Training has changed my life and the way I used to think; from innovation for self-gratification to innovation that understands a market and is viable enough to create jobs and help people to make money while responding to community problems. I am grateful to UNDP and partners” -Says Monica Jackson, a female innovator and participant from Koindu City, Kono District. -The six-month has now passed, and at the end of the course, the plan is for the innovators to be guided by the Lab, LUCT and other partners to set-up their start-up businesses. We have witnessed a real transformation of the innovators from shy young people not too sure of themselves or their innovations to confident, forwarding thinking and enthusiastic individuals who have been motivated and shown by industry leaders what could be possible with some critical thinking and hard work.-What now for these enthusiastic budding entrepreneurs! With innovations ranging from re-usable sanitary pads for women to hydroponics agriculture, from a sensor security device to fuel-less generators, from a solar water purification system to energy efficient cook stoves, the potential for long lasting impact is very real if these solutions and innovators are nurtured and guided. To kickstart this process, the accelerator lab will be holding a showcase event in the first quarter of 2021, to introduce the innovators and their innovations to key stakeholders in Government, development agencies and the private sector. We hope potential investors will see somethings that inspires them to invest resources in the innovators, whether money, time, or networking opportunities.-2021, we hope will be a better year for all. At the UNDP Accelerator Lab, we hope to run experiments on a selected number of these innovations, which was the aim at the start of the journey. We hope to do it in partnership with other stakeholder so that the impact can be catalytic. The showcase event will be the foundation for sparking widespread interest and excitement in other potential partners.-Alas! Together with our partners, we have been able to give these young people the opportunity to grow themselves, critically rethink their innovations and operating models, and leading a life-changing experience with young people during a pandemic that reminds us how to support our beneficiaries from a distance. “The UNDP/Limkokwing Training has shifted my focus from just designing a prototype to product effectiveness, affordability and user-friendly.”- Franklyn Koroma, a young male innovator and participant from Freetown Western Urban Area.","['Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Donors,Development Effectiveness,Blog post,Design Thinking,Sierra Leone,Partnerships,Solutions Mapping,Sensemaking,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

These thoughts boggled her mind.- -I, We must do something!-At around 4:00AM she decided to start calling (and texting when they never picked up) fellow staff members to join her and UNDP’s efforts to not leave the homeless behind during the lockdown. It may not be much but the gestures is what matters most...showing that we care and that we are together in this matters a lot more. Just come and support” she would tell half-sleepy colleagues on phone. By the break of dawn, she had some staff and members of “our good old friends” the One family People (OFP) – a civil society organization that advocates for the rights of Persons With Disabilities with her. Together they quickly pooled resources and organized freshly cooked meals and drinking water which they served to over 300 homeless people, persons with disabilities and street children in Freetown. -“It is sad to see that there are people out here with nothing to survive on during the lock-down. With this gesture, we would like to ease both the physical and emotional impacts of the 3-day national COVID-19 lockdown on the homeless”. Tanzila Sankoh.-Moved by the outcome of the action, the UNDP Resident Representative Dr. Samuel Doe said, “we would like to continue helping out in this area not just as a one-off but more often during this pandemic more especially during the lock-downs.”-Indeed, Ms. Tanzila is set to continue providing meals for the homeless and helpless in Freetown...”if I had it in my powers I would do it for the entire country’s homeless because Freetown is not Sierra Leone, we have so many people on the streets, many with disabilities from the Civil War, others are even Ebola orphans.”-While dry food items are being distributed to vulnerable communities and individuals as part of the national response to COVID-19, the ‘wet-feeding’ approach is an intervention are yet to venture into. Tanzila is currently soliciting funds to scale-up the ‘act of kindness’ in the event of another lock-down. -“It truly leaves no one behind because it caters for those society has forgotten like those with mental illnesses who will not get the dry foods because they are not accounted for, in our world they are invisible and ostracized, yet they are also people. Thanks to UNDP for this thoughtful act of kindness.” Edward Emmanuel, team Leader, One Family People.-

Frequent handwashing with soap and water are key to preventing acquisition and spread of COVID-19 besides other measures. -However, a huge number of people in Sierra Leone still suffer from inadequate access to these basic yet life-saving amenities. This fact coupled with prevailing poor hygiene practices and the current global shortage of essential disease prevention and control supplies renders Sierra Leoneans highly vulnerable population to the disease. -Spotting the dire need to mobilize local ideas, resources and solutions that assure country-specific response to a global pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic prior to Sierra Leone registering her index case,  UNDP’s Accelerator Lab (AccLab) launched a WhatSapp campaign to rally local innovators and map their details from the National Grassroot Solutions Database to prepare and re-position themselves to play pivotal roles in supporting the national response through creative thinking and innovation. -For COVID-19 response, the AccLab challenged innovators to come up with locally designed products to complement dwindling imported supplies. Consistent also with Goal 17 of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), UNDP’s partnership with local innovators across Sierra Leone during a pandemic has glitzed a national call to action on the encouragement of local expertise and products to respond to the pandemic. -With sobering enthusiasm, innovators came up with a range of locally produced samples and prototypes of Infection, Prevention, and Control (IPC) materials including alcohol-based hand rub, liquid soap, face masks, hand gloves, hand washing stations. Some innovators have gone further to venture into the medical field to produce equipment like ventilators. To support the growth of these extra-ordinary ideas to support the fight against COVID-19 and to help further Sierra Leone’s recovery after the pandemic, UNDP plans to support selected innovators to scale-up production of direly essential items to meet current demands. -The Accelerator Lab Team have also been the liaison between the country office and local producers of IPC products (alcohol-based hand sanitizers and liquid soaps) and equipment (hand washing stations).   Sourcing the most innovative and practical items from local innovators, they have helped both operations and programme teams to identify local suppliers transcending the procurement difficulties presented by COVID-19.

Such startups can cut across sectors, and be multi-effective, allowing communities to create the futures they want to see.- This is especially important in Somalia, which is emerging from protracted conflict and crisis, and is still building a full private sector ecosystem. It is doubly important for people in displaced communities, who may not have access to a range of services or find it difficult to access ecosystems that could assist them.-To support communities in building social startups, in December 2018, UNDP, together with the EU and the Benadir Regional Administration, launched the first course on social entrepreneurship for people in displaced communities in Somalia. Five hundred IDPs (internally displaced persons) in Mogadishu took part in the course and learned the basics of social startups, how to build a product from scratch, and also basic accounting. The course focused on using social business to address challenges such as water and sanitation, food production and agriculture, public health, waste management and renewable energy, among others.-The social entrepreneurship course is part of a joint ‘RE-INTEG’ project which is working to find long term, durable and sustainable ways to help communities come out of protracted displacement in Mogadishu.-When we asked students about their experience with the course, several replied: “We thought it was going to be just like any other business course, but it is not... it took us some time to understand that social entrepreneurship is different, and that the products we are building must make money but also be useful to our communities”. Another student pointed out that “We really must think a lot about possible business ideas in this course; I have already presented a lot of ideas but I am still not there yet... I may look into the possibility of recycling metal scraps into something new”. A third one, working on a business model canvas about shoes made from recycled materials, added: “we know our communities, and we strive to build products that are high quality and low price”.-Many of the men and women taking part in the course have now started testing their prototypes with family, neighbors and in the market, to collect feedback, using real examples of their product. Their ideas are innovative and wide ranging -  mattresses made of coconut fibers and cutlery from recycled metal, not to mention cleaning products, baskets, bags and all sorts of sauces and chutneys, among others. In all products, we saw creativity, dignity and hope.-The students with the best ideas from the course will go into a UNDP supported incubator, as part of the RE-INTEG project, to develop their ideas further.  There is much more to do, but I cannot help thinking about how far social entrepreneurship can go in Somalia, as communities use their talent and creativity to drive their own solutions to the challenges they face.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Entrepreneurship,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Somalia,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Economic recovery"

The Power to Inspire a New Age of Development.",200,"['Home', 'Blog', 'What do Fungi, Beavers and Elephants have in Common? The Power to Inspire a New Age of Development.']","Posted on March 24, 2022","“In biology, you learn about nature, and our species tend to spend a lot of time learning about nature, while biomimicry turns the lens around and says: what can I learn from the natural world?. So, in summary, (biomimicry) is the practice of learning from nature in order to emulate it”.The Late Claire Janisch, Founding Director of BiomimicrySA-Why emulate nature? Nature has evolved over millions of years in order to continually support life and its various ecosystems. Having stood the test of time, natural systems hold genius knowledge of what it takes and how to maintain life without depleting the environment which sustains it. With the world facing climate change, depleting resources, and embarking on the 4th industrial revolution, it becomes important, now more than ever, to identify alternate methods of “being” – methods that promote living in harmony with our environment.-Biomimicry concepts have over recent years translated into tangible products and solutions for everyday living. For example, the Eastgate Mall in Zimbabwe was constructed to emulate the cooling mechanisms of termite mounds[1], and Japan’s bullet trains have been designed to mimic the Kingfisher bird[2].-Let’s get back to the fungi, beavers and elephants 😊  -An ecosystem is a community of organisms such as microbes, plants, insects, birds and animals that interact with one another. These organisms depend on each other to reproduce, survive, and thrive. For example, a beaver builds a dam across a river, and plants grow on the riverbank on either side of the dam. The dam protects the plants from strong winds and floods. The plants protect the beaver from predators. Furthermore, the beaver helps the plants as it builds a lodge on the bank where it stores food. The lodge provides shelter for birds that feed on insects. In some cases, the insects feed on the nectar from some of the plants. All these plants and animals provide a home to several other insects that feed on the plants and one another. These insects excrete waste which collects at the base of the plants and helps fertilise them. The dead trees are used as food by insects, birds and other animals. In more complex ecosystems there are also larger animals that feed on both plants and insects. In return, these larger animals help to distribute the seeds of the plants far and wide. In the above example, the beaver is considered a keystone species, as its presence allows for information and resource exchange that create abundance for the entire ecosystem. By ensuring the survival of keystone species, benefits cascade to the entire ecosystem, keeping it in balance. 
- -Keystone species also exist in socio-technical systems in some shape or form. Identifying and leveraging them has the power to create positive systemic shifts that can result in groundbreaking opportunities. To this end, UNDP South Africa and BiomimicrySA partnered to commission a study to unearth innovative and sustainable socio-economic opportunities by applying the concepts of biomimicry and design thinking. In particular, we chose to undertake this study in four communities in South Africa where UNDP and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are presently rolling-out low-cost internet through the Television WhiteSpace (TVWS) Technology. This study was conducted alongside the internet release project to promote environmental sustainability in the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR), where often solutions/products can have adverse effects on the environment (considering the toxicity of e-waste or inefficient energy consumption).-Many aspects of 4IR already incorporate biomimicry - artificial Intelligence copies human intelligence; drones are based on nature's animals of flight; the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors draw inspiration from human senses and its connectivity through the central nervous system. However, at a basic level there is still a need to ensure the 4IR is sustainable – for all forms of life.  Given that the 4th Industrial Revolution is only getting started, the opportunity (and responsibility) exists now to ensure it protects the planet rather than destroys it.-
By employing biomimicry and design thinking methodologies to uncover new socio-economic opportunities resulting from improved internet connectivity, communities are empowered to develop solutions that are empathetic to all life forms, environmentally friendly, socially sustainable and regenerative. In this way, emergent opportunities will empower locals to reap maximum benefits from improved internet access, but also promote social and environmental sustainability – addressing many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.-The study to unearth socio-economic opportunities through biomimicry and design thinking commenced with several community engagements and consultations in Mpophomeni (KwaZulu-Natal), Mdantsane (Eastern Cape), Ocean View (Western Cape), and Botshabelo (Free State), with the aim to support locals in unearthing challenges and opportunities which if addressed, could improve their community’s socioeconomic status by fostering growth and development.  In parallel, Biomimicry experts undertook ecological analyses within the four provinces, assessing the local environment to identify “keystone species” which could inspire solutions to the identified challenges. The challenges/opportunities prioritised by the communities were then framed as questions to nature to inspire the creation of environmentally conscious solutions. 
- -The infographic below summarises the immediate findings:-After posing the various challenges to nature, here’s what nature had to say!-The Eastern Cape
-The Mdantsane township in the Eastern Cape is sprawled across a hilly landscape of terrestrial ‘peninsulas’, that fall away to steep vegetated ravines, with a thickly covered mix of coastal forest and thicket vegetation. The present-day landscape is dominated by urban infrastructure. Mdantsane is situated within the Thicket Biome, characterised by a rainforest flora.  Thicket traditionally supports rich animal life and large animals, such as elephants, which are an essential - keystone - part of the workings of the thicket. Species such as the elephant have been – and still are – important ecosystem engineers.  The elephant creates and maintains the environment in which other species live. For example, they dig holes, plough the ground, remove trees, and turn over rocks, creating habitats for other organisms. Elephants help in seed dispersal and germination, regeneration of woodland and damaged grasslands. They regulate bush fires and control populations of other animals.- -The Western Cape-The story of Ocean View starts with the story of the Cape Peninsular. Over the past 5 million years, the Peninsular has been a series of islands, a giant dune-scape, a peninsular and a glacier site. With the combined drop in sea levels and the concurrent emergence of a sandy bridge at this point (what is now the Cape Flats), the Peninsular connected with the ‘mainland’ of Africa. The ocean currents which split close to the southernmost point of Africa, especially the fauna-rich cold Benguela Current were affected by this process as natural bays, such as Hout Bay, formed and became the socio-economic lifeblood (and tourism attraction) of the Peninsular, including Ocean View. Another important environmental aspect of Ocean View is the prevailing wind - the strong and dry Southeaster and the surrounding biodiverse fynbos and Strandveld floral regions. Fynbos is a small belt of natural shrubland and Strandveld is a beach scrub that covers and stabilises sand dunes on the beaches. All these natural characteristics provide rich inspiration for solutions to the various issues facing this culturally diverse community. - -The Free State-Botshabelo generally appears flat, vast and expansive, lying 1400-1450m above sea level and supporting a range of small and medium-size animals. The township is bisected by the seasonal Klein Modder River, a fork of the larger Modder River which feeds the Rustfontein Dam and Nature Reserve. Botshabelo falls within the Grassland Biome. The present-day vegetation surrounding Botshabelo is mostly a degraded grassland, and intentionally planted native and exotic shade-bearing trees or hedging shrubs. The Free State Biodiversity Plan (2016) classifies large parts of Botshabelo as an Ecosystem Support Area (an area that supports the ecological functioning of a protected area).-Aeons before the World Wide Web there was the Wood-Wide Web mediated by the Mycorrhizal fungus, which is an underground keystone species. Mycorrhizae aids in water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil in exchange for sugars and inorganic nutrients from the host. The Mycorrhizal fungus enables ‘tree talk' - communication amongst plants, analogous to the role of modern-day internet. Communication happens through the transfer of signals and other environmental cues that influence plant adaptive behaviour and impacts the entire forest ecosystem. When a tree is under attack it sends chemical signals through the air and the underground fungal network to other plants, warning them to raise their defences. The roots of maize defend against phytopathogens by releasing a pesticide which also attracts a beneficial microbe that preys on the target pest. The roots fungal network also distributes resources emanating from dead plants to neighbouring plants and allows mature trees to send nutrients to seedlings lying in shaded areas that are unable to photosynthesise.- -KwaZulu-Natal-Mpophomeni is located on a series of hillslopes, is bounded by nature on 3 sides and situated a little distance from the nearest town. To the north, is it bordered by the provincial road, the Midmar Dam and the provincial nature reserve; to the west by commercial forestry plantations; to the east by peri-urban agricultural and residential smallholdings; and to the south by indigenous forest which separates it from a band of settlements. As a result, any impacts and challenges created within and affecting Mpophomeni have broader-reaching ecological impacts.  The flip-side is that Mpophomeni should have higher biodiversity than most other peri-urban areas of KZN. When looking at inspiration from nature to address the many challenges in Mpophomeni, the high biodiversity potential and endemism is important to incorporate. The majority of land in the Midlands has always been ideal for farming.-Since 1950 timber has been more profitable than dairy or beef farming and the trend towards afforestation had accelerated.  The climate of the area is exceptionally favourable for timber and hence paper mill giants have invested in extensive timber plantations. Much of the region has now been converted into timber monoculture which also had a large effect on the hydrological integrity of the region. Timber plantations use large amounts of water, reducing stream flow and due to pollutants, both from industry, agriculture, and burgeoning human population, water resource degradation is prevalent. Mpophomeni’s water story is based on the uMngeni water Catchment, within which is situated, and which supplies several key dams that supply major towns and cities. Pollution of the catchment is raising concern about the water quality in one of the country’s most important dams.  -Timber monoculture is the creation of an ecosystem with a single species of tree. In Mpophomeni timber, monoculture is a result of humans cutting indigenous trees and planting a single species for commercial timber. This practice destroys the ecosystem and culminates in the loss of biodiversity and soil degradation. Furthermore, monoculture lacks resilience provided by diversity and an attack by some beetles or disease can affect the entire plantation. Preserving biodiversity is important to maintain ecosystem balance.- -Hence, nature has given us many solutions to the various challenges identified. The next phase of this project will prototype and pilot some of them. Interestingly, I find myself concluding this blog on a flight to Cape Town to attend a summit on Digitisation and 4IR. With the vast green landscape below me and the gaping blue openness alongside me, I am reminded that to succeed in the digital era, we best be continually asking ourselves “what will nature do”? -If you’re inspired by this nature-led journey, reach out to me at klariska.moodley@undp.org.- -In memory of the late Claire Janisch, founding director of BiomimicrySA-References-[1] https://inhabitat.com/building-modelled-on-termites-eastgate-centre-in-zimbabwe/-[2] https://www.oreilly.com/content/what-happens-when-you-combine-a-kingfisher-and-a-bullet-train-innovation/-[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_dam#/media/File:AlgonquinBeaverDam.JPG

TVWS harnesses unused spectrum between T.V broadcast bands that can be utilised to provide broadband without interference to the broadcasters. Through this initiative, the SMMEs are providing affordable digital connectivity via wi-fi hotspots to individuals, schools, clinics, taxi ranks, digital hubs, and other public facilities in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern and Western Cape, and the Free State. This initiative forms part of UNDP’s ongoing efforts to advance inclusive growth through entrepreneurship/youth development programmes and extending connectivity to remote areas and vulnerable populations to tackle the digital divide that prevents societies from harnessing the full benefits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can deliver. Songezo Mhambi, CEO of Mdantsane Mobile, is one of the beneficiaries of the UNDP-CSIR initiative and his company is already serving the community in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape. Mdantsane Mobile was established by Songezo in 2019 as a community Wi-Fi network operating from his grandmother’s backroom, selling handwritten Wi-Fi vouchers to neighbours. Songezo shared his story of success as a young entrepreneur thriving in rural Mdantsane.- -Q: Why do you do what you do?-A: I’m not only concerned with just Mdantsane or South Africa being left behind in development, but the entire African continent missing out on yet another industrial revolution as we’ve done in the first three revolutions. I believe the 4th industrial revolution should be Africa’s opportunity to showcase that we have the will and the ability to also play a leading role in the world.- -Q: Why do you think it’s important for citizens residing in townships and villages to have access to reliable internet? What are the current challenges and how is Mdantsane Mobile filling the gap?-A: These are the citizens who are normally deprived of accessing several resources, including exposure to valuable information. That is why internet access is vital to remote areas citizens to have access to all the critical information at their fingertips. As municipalities continue to adopt digitization, residents will begin to manage all their municipal services online, including library material and other things. Even E-commerce is gaining prominence, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. This access and relative opportunities should not only be exclusive to citizens living in urban areas; should the citizen in rural areas and townships be able to access affordable internet, they are likely to benefit way more from doing most day-to-day tasks and running errands virtually online.  - -Q: What kind of support did you receive from UNDP-CSIR?-A: Through the UNDP-CSIR intervention, we were provided with 15 high-performance outdoor Wi-Fi client stations/hotspots equipment. Included was 12 months’ worth of operating capital support for the project. The CSIR also holds some training seminars to assist all participating SMMEs around the areas of business management and technical training around TV White Space technology. -Q: How has your business grown since the introduction to UNDP/CSIR?-A: The 15 hotspots add to the already existing public Wi-Fi network we had been building and has expanded the public wi-fi coverage by 3 times. This means we can reach more subscribers in Mdantsane. This is critical as 70% of Mdantsane’s s close to 200 000 residents had been found to not have adequate access to the internet in the 2011 census report.-Q: Do you think this model is sustainable for your community and what about affordability, with most townships/villages populated with citizens who live below the poverty line, can they afford it?-A: Yes, it is highly sustainable. We cater for a wide range of subscribers. We have prepaid subscribers who make use of our Wi-Fi vouchers which retail from as little as R25 for 1,5GB including R100 for 10GB. Prepaid subscribers can also share data with friends by linking more dives to connect from the same voucher.-We also have our fixed home Wi-Fi which starts at R499 per month for 10 MBPS Uncapped internet. Households pay a once-off installation fee of R999 to be activated and have an internet outdoor dish and indoor Wi-Fi router installed in their home. Other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) charge more than R 2,000 for the installation fee of fixed wireless internet and R 999 for 10 MBPS Uncapped internet per month.-Q: How do you see the internet penetration transforming your community? Any examples of impact?-A: Schools in the area had been struggling with connectivity for years right up to the lack of telephone systems. The internet also presents an opportunity to move the schools’ administration to VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) which requires reliable internet access for the telephone to work. Residents will have more, faster access to valuable information and the ability to search and apply for employment online. Municipal services are beginning to move online with residents being able and encouraged to attend to their municipal account affairs electronically. School pupils are also adopting e-learning along with their educators and, internet access is vital to ensure this digital transition runs moves smoothly so Mdantsane and other townships don’t get left behind in the 4th industrial revolution.-Fast facts about Mdantsane Mobile- -How many people do you employ and how many of them are women?-9 (Nine) employees and 5 (Five) young women.-What are your plans for the future?-We are looking to expand to the rest of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality while deploying small network cells in other provinces to begin building our national footprint.

This expedition, however, is less about unearthing prehistoric reptiles and more about reimagining the stressed urban water cycle in South Africa. The scientists sought to determine how best to innovate within existing urban water systems to enhance water and economic savings and efficiencies.- -As the chopper lands amid gushing coastlines and futuristic waterways, the scientists are transported on globe-like vehicles to tour the theme park’s urban water network – a blueprint for modern cities. Throughout this ultramodern globe ride, the scientists observe the intricate journey of water from the water source to the end-user and its return through recycling.  - -The scientists note that South Africa’s urban water system, like this one and most other systems on earth (both natural and man-made), is complex; a web of interdependencies, having extreme vulnerability to external influences, in a constant state of flux, and requires consistent upkeep. Consequently, single-point solutions prove inadequate at addressing the various challenges that arise over time in such complex systems.  The scientists agree that to positively influence the urban water system in South Africa, a portfolio of solutions must be created where each solution within the portfolio addresses challenges or enhances the performance at key leverage points in the water system. - -Okay...reality check! The team of scientists constituted UNDP AccLab SA and valued partner, the Water Research Commission (WRC). Additionally, as that glamorous ride on a helicopter to an exotic island was not possible (COVID 19 restrictions, and all! 😉), the team examined local water systems by tapping into the knowledge of water experts and innovators who are transforming the South African water sector. Together, here’s how we’ve begun reimagining the urban water cycle and building a portfolio of solutions.- -South Africa’s Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) indicated in its 2019/20 annual report that South Africa is naturally inclined to drought conditions being a semi-arid country, and that these conditions were exacerbated following the strong 2015-16 El Niño events. The El Niño impacts combined with the ongoing droughts, presumably have resulted in significant declines in the water, resources of the country. This is substantiated by the decline in dam levels, reservoir storage and even groundwater levels based on the available data collected by DWS [DWS, 2019/20].- -According to the South African National Water and Sanitation Master Plan (2018), to increase water supply in the country, there is a need to optimise the water mix (which is currently dominated by surface water), with groundwater and effluent from wastewater treatment plants, water reclamation, as well as desalination and treated acid-mine drainage. The Master plan also states that 56% of wastewater treatment works and 44% of water treatment works are in poor or critical condition, suggesting a need for new solutions and improved maintenance.  - -In 2020, South Africa, like the rest of the world, succumbed to the  COVID-19 pandemic and the government took strong measures to curb the spread of the disease. A key component of the prevention measures was to encourage citizens to practice good hygiene through regular handwashing. However, many South Africans, especially those in rural and peri-urban areas, simply lacked access to water resources/services to do so. 3 million South Africans still do not have access to basic water supply services. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlights Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. - -It is against this backdrop that AccLab SA and WRC launched a national call for water innovations. The aim was to gather a pool of innovations at varying stages of technology readiness, which can play a critical role in a range of priority areas for the water sector. UNDP and WRC sought to fast track the development and promote the adoption of promising innovations through the Water Innovation Challenge, with the long-term objective being to accelerate the rate at which we achieve progress on SDG 6. -Here’s a look at the portfolio of innovations uncovered through the challenge and where they fit within the urban water system. In the image below, coloured dots indicate where the innovation is positioned within the urban water system. For example, the green dots indicate that GreenGold Technology addresses the aquaculture sector.  - -Through the Innovation Challenge, the identified solutions were experimented in the field - in environments where they will eventually find applications. As the solutions ranged from those identifying new water sources to those treating wastewater, experiments were conducted at wastewater plants, aquaculture facilities, dams, etc. The status of the experiments is reported later.  - -In addition to supporting in-field experiments, the seven small businesses/innovators were also assisted in evaluating market needs, provided with expert technical advice, conducted independent technology reviews, and continue to be linked with potential scaling partners.- -Status of innovation challenge experiments/technology demonstrations- -As testing continues and attempts are made to scale successfully tested innovations, the hope is that over time the identified solutions will become vital parts of the local urban water system.  - -Capturing and sharing the learnings-Throughout the technology evaluation process, extensive knowledge and lessons were surfaced. This included techniques to improve experimental designs and logistical arrangements, how to manage partnerships as well as external influences, and how these can impact product development. To capture and share the rich knowledge emanating from the Water Innovation Challenge with other innovators and development practitioners, UNDP, together with WRC, Isle Utilities, Bosch Capital and Bosch Projects partnered to produce the UNDP-WRC Entrepreneurship Training Guide. The guide, developed with extensive inputs from the innovators about their experiences, seeks to provide early-stage entrepreneurs with business development support and assist developmental institutions better shape future innovation challenges to achieve greater impact. The guide also served as training material during a follow-up workshop for the seven innovators, where they were provided with expert guidance on how to move their businesses to the next developmental stage.  -You can download the guide here:-https://www.za.undp.org/content/south_africa/en/home/library/undp-wrc-entrepreneurship-training-guide.html","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Blog post,Featured,partnerships,UNDP Donor Partners,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Case study,Klariska Moodley,South Africa,English,Water and sanitation,English,UN Agencies,Accelerator Labs"

-The South African 2021 Local Government Elections were a contentious one. Civil unrest, court battles, and the socio-economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic all contributed towards the lowest voter turn-out in post-Apartheid South Africa.- -For the first time in the country’s democratic era, voter turnout went below the 50% mark, with only 46% of registered voters heading to the polls to exercise their civic duty. Not only did 14 million registered voters fail to show, a further 14 million people eligible to vote did not register at all.- -Voter participation is one of the indicators of the health of a democracy, and while it is not the only means to participate in democratic system, it is one of the simplest. When faced with the low 2021 voter numbers, one must ask what this means for the strength of the country’s democratic promise and its processes.- -The Absent Youth-Of major concern is the ongoing decline in the registration rates among South Africa’s youth. Nearly 1.8-million eligible 18-19-year-olds decided against registering to vote, with registration rates among the 20-29 age group also declining significantly since the previous election.- -With young people bearing the brunt of current decision-making in the future, their participation in how they want to be governed is crucial for the existence and well-being of democratic political culture. Their participation in the electoral process is key to building a stable and peaceful state with policies that respond to future needs.- -Previously, low voter turnout was easily dismissed by political parties and pundits alike as “voter apathy”, however, such a mass stayaway points to a much more complicated mix of political powerlessness, disillusionment, and distrust of formal political mechanisms such as voting.- -The Apathetic or the Alienated?-Furthermore, the cry of “apathy” rings hollow. South Africa’s youth-led movements such as #FeesMustFall and #RhodesMustFall provide contrasting views to perceptions that young people are indifferent to the future of their country.- -A series of youth dialogue sessions held by Activate Change Drivers, a youth leadership development programme, revealed that youth held little faith in political processes that shape the country. They felt that they are underrepresented or not represented at all by those running for office and their best interest or concerns are disregarded. According to the participants, youth resort to public protests as a preferable way to express their grievances and obtain a response from those in authority. Formal democratic processes such as voting, signing petitions, and attending meetings were generally not seen as effective.- -In this regard, it appears that youth are not apathetic, but rather politically alienated. Political alienation refers to one’s enduring sense of estrangement from, or rejection of, the prevailing political system. Politically alienated people feel compelled to act, but are restricted by their sense of insignificance to the system.- -Staging an Intervention-An oft-cited strategy to overcome voting resistance is civic education. Civic education is concerned with providing citizens with an understanding of the workings of a political system and their rights and responsibilities within it. This type of instruction empowers people with the information and skills necessary to engage in all aspects of a democratic society, especially aspects such as voting.- -Yet knowledge does not necessarily result in action. How then does one ensure that civic understanding evolves to civic participation? Voter education must be about more than how to vote and more about why voting can be a powerful tool for participatory democracies.- -Like economically underprivileged segments of a society, youth may be assumed to have few resources to influence policymaking and may further be handicapped by a perception that they are not mature enough to speak for themselves. However, the ballot is a great equalizer. Everyone’s vote counts the same, even if there are vast disparities of resources. By voting, young people have the same ability as others to exercise legitimate political influence or pressure. However, for this message to get across, it needs to be communicated to youth in a manner that resonates with them.- -Civic education does not necessarily have to be the sole responsibility of adults. Youth can take the lead in teaching their peers about government and the importance of their participation in a way that best reflects them.- -This was the thought that drove the partnership between UNDP and Front Row Studios to develop “Democracy on Stage,” - a play about Democracy and Voter Education to encourage youth to actively participate in elections. The play was developed by youth for youth and considered the issues they face and emphasized their value as full-fledged democratic citizens. - -Theatre was chosen as it is uniquely valuable for understanding, criticizing, and even resisting politics. Theatre’s access to a rich range of emotions and discursive styles can counter the flattening and normalizing power of dominant discourses, such as the reduction of low turnout to mere “voter apathy”. It is a well-suited medium for teaching civic attention.- -Another value of theatre is that it is not confined to the stage. “Democracy on Stage” was designed as a mobile industrial theatre production that could be performed throughout the country, especially in those rural areas that political campaigns often overlook.- -In its first week, the play reached over 1,500 youth in six provinces across the country and, while it was difficult to gauge the impact the play had on the election outcome, it did serve as an important step toward inclusive political participation. -- -The Way Forward-Inclusive participation is not only a fundamental political and democratic right but is also crucial to building stable and peaceful societies and developing policies that respond to the specific needs of younger generations. For young people to be adequately represented in the political space, especially in elections, they must know their rights and be given the necessary knowledge and capacity to participate in a meaningful way at all levels. However, how civic education is communicated is just as important as the information and skills it seeks to convey.- -Where possible, youth need to take the lead in civic matters and express their voices in ways that resonate with them. Through “Democracy on Stage”, youth not only engaged with and capacitated their peers, but also recognized their importance as critical political stakeholders and found their way, and cast their vote for the future.

Whilst every effort was made to bolster the country’s health sector and impose restrictions to contain the spread of the virus, severe national lockdowns resulted in extensive job losses and food insecurity reaching new peaks. Many South Africans became reliant on social protection and even then, faced increasing food prices and transport fares that dissolved their already limited resources. Considering that nutrition in vulnerable communities is generally of poor quality, people become more susceptible to infection.-To curb hunger, enhance nutrition and reduce COVID-19 related mortality rates, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) South Africa partnered with the Institute of Natural Resources (INR) to introduce sustainable gardens in 127 rural, peri-urban and urban households in the KwaZulu-Natal Province. The communities in this area face high levels of poverty, with many being unemployed. Majority are reliant on social grants or household-scale farming as a means of income, and a source of food. Through UNDP and INR support, the 127 households constructed and tested three innovative garden designs. These gardens were designed to use recycled grey water and food/plant biowaste generated within the households and were constructed using local materials.  -Additionally, the participating households were supplied with small livestock where they could choose either egg laying hens, indigenous chickens, or meat rabbits. While the households successfully used the small livestock as a source of food, this blog will focus on the results of the three vegetable gardens. However, keep an eye out for future blogs that will discuss the results related to the small livestock.   -The project examined how these interventions impacted household nutrition, food security, and COVID-19 resilience and compared the performance and uptake of the three garden technologies and small stock options against each other and against traditional methods of vegetable production and livestock keeping. Many households indicated that the gardens helped to supplement their diets, with some not procuring additional vegetables for several months. Some households either donated excess vegetables to their neighbours or sold it at local markets to generate additional income.  Overall, the communities indicated a preference for the innovative gardens citing its ease of use, reduced labour requirements, and that vegetables appeared to grow faster in comparison to traditional farming methods.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 1  No poverty,Klariska Moodley,South Africa,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

In stark contrast, we are also home to some of the poorest communities, plagued with unemployment and must strive to bridge economic and social inequality. This is known as South Africa’s triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment. Economic growth is therefore a prime agenda in the National Development Plan, with our environment considered a catalyst towards devising many potential solutions.- -As we confront this reality, we invite you to imagine with us another path, one where we transform our relationship with the planet. We invite you to act with us too; we can co-create a new vision. From 4-6 October 2021, the virtual Nature for Life Hub, coinciding with the 76th United Nations General Assembly, is calling each and every one of us – activists, philanthropic leaders, businesses, scientists Heads of State, and Indigenous representatives – to make the transformational changes needed for a nature-positive future.- -Day 1 of the Hub, on 4 October 2021, Transforming our Relationship to the Planet, offers powerful examples of initiatives that are beginning this transformational change at the local, global, and national levels. As a contribution, we are sharing how maps are helping us bring together diverse stakeholders to put nature at the heart of sustainable development. We are working together with stakeholders ranging from local communities, spatial agencies, leading scientists, and our government to create a map of hope that charts where to act for nature, climate, and humankind. Because we are a country facing stark poverty, unemployment, and inequality, our ‘map of hope’ is helping us to determine where actions for nature can nurture the biodiversity economy and invest in the conservation and rehabilitation of important natural areas that deliver the ecosystem services we need to survive and thrive.- -South Africa is considered a global leader in the use of spatial data for policymaking; however, these data are seldom integrated across sectors in a meaningful way. Yet, maps help us see where nature is thriving, where it is being destroyed, and where it is contributing to economic development. Gathering national experts for a virtual consultation series is helping us take this important step. We are working together to identify a cohesive set of top national policy targets related to nature, climate, and sustainable development. Using spatial data to represent these goals, we are identifying a series of essential life support areas – or ELSAs – that if protected, sustainably managed or restored, can provide our citizens with the ecosystem services that are critical to mankind's wellbeing, such as carbon storage, food, freshwater, water filtration, and disaster risk reduction. After perfecting this process through several iterations, and producing maps of hope for specific themes, we will be embedding the results into specific national policies for nature, climate, and development.- -The ELSA maps are a key tool to help us build consensus on how and where to act, aligning policymakers around the common goal of safeguarding our planetary safety net. For the first time, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) South Africa, the South African Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, and the South African National Biodiversity Institute and other stakeholders are collectively identifying mechanisms to better foster the economic contribution of wildlife ranching to the biodiversity economy and Ecosystem-based Adaptation approach to climate change using ELSA maps. Mapping synergies and trade-offs in potential development pathways are helping us to integrate the spatial prioritization and planning, already developed in South Africa in a number of sectors, as we strive to transition towards a more nature-positive economy that leaves no one behind.- -During Day 1 of the Nature for Life Hub, hear from unique voices that are mapping hope in Cambodia, Costa Rica, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and South Africa. Journey to a world where indigenous peoples in the Ecuadorian Amazon can map the lands they have safeguarded for millennia on a mobile app, even without internet connectivity.

The country is home to 10% of the world’s plant species and 7% of its reptile, bird and mammal species. Furthermore, endemism rates reach 56% for amphibians, 65% for plants and up to 70% for invertebrates. The Government of South Africa has identified the biodiversity economy as a catalyst to address the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty, and inequality. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has partnered with the Government of South Africa through the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) to pilot 8 financial solutions which will advance the biodiversity economy agenda of the country. The biodiversity economy, if supported, can play a major role in the COVID-19 recovery agenda.  According to the South African National Biodiversity Assessment, published by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) in 2018, there are more than 418,000 biodiversity-related jobs in the country. This speaks volumes to the contribution of biodiversity towards addressing issues of unemployment in a post-COVID-19 agenda.- -South Africa has been recognised globally for its efforts in providing fiscal incentives to promote the conservation of biodiversity. The South African Government, through the National Treasury, has provided fiscal incentives in the form of biodiversity tax incentives aiming to fulfil national environmental policy to preserve the environment. This is facilitated through the Government-led regime of entering into bilateral agreements with private and communal landowners to formally conserve and maintain a particular area of land. These bilateral agreements result in declared protected areas and are established through the national biodiversity stewardship initiative. These agreements result in environmental management expenses incurred by taxpayers as well as loss of economic rights and use. The biodiversity tax incentives present a mechanism to address the mitigation of management costs, address potential loss of production income due to land management restrictions, ensure the continued investment of landowners and communities in long term and effective land management. This mechanism ultimately assists in the sustainability of compatible commercial operations essential to the persistence of the area and the economy and livelihood growth required in South Africa.- -The BIOFIN programme in South Africa is currently working with the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment (DFFE) to promote the implementation of biodiversity tax incentives. The feasibility of the biodiversity tax incentives has been thoroughly tested through various projects including the partnership between SANBI and UNDP on the Biodiversity Land Use (BLU) project. The BLU project has successfully made progress in improving tax incentives for biodiversity stewardship. This project was instrumental in advocating for the 2014 amendment to the Income Tax Act that was published, which included a new Section 37D.  Section 37D has provided much-needed expense relief as well as long-term financial sustainability to privately and communally owned and managed protected areas. Biodiversity tax incentives have proven to be a lifeline for many during the COVID-19 pandemic by enabling continued conservation and livelihood sustenance. The UNDP and SANBI, through the BLU project, collected testimonials from nature reserves based in Limpopo and KwaZulu-Nata, explaining how the Section 37D tax benefit had been beneficial to them.- -Kaingo Private Game Reserve (Limpopo Province)-Kaingo Private Game Reserve is a tourism operation in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The nature reserve was declared in perpetuity placing the onus on the landowner to ensure that biodiversity was maintained and conserved. As a result of this landowner’s commitment to conservation, Kaingo has received the Section 37D tax break. Due to the extensive investment in the tourism venture and the management of a big game area, the tangible financial benefit of this innovative tax incentive is bolstering the reserve’s cash flow, ensuring the continued success of this protected area. By paying less tax, additional resources can be mobilized so that Kaingo can be better managed and governed, thus continuing to grow its wildlife tourism operations in order benefit both South Africa’s biodiversity and its economy.- -Manyoni Private Game Reserve (KwaZulu Natal Province)-Manyoni Private Game Reserve is a family-owned reserve that was set up from the desire to help save endangered spaces for endangered species. The 22 000-hectare reserve is now declared as a nature reserve. The costs in maintaining and improving the environment are substantial and Section 37D tax benefit has been a tangible financial benefit received from the State for conserving biodiversity. The challenges in conserving biodiversity and operating a viable business in the wildlife economy have increased dramatically over the past years, leading to the tax incentive helping the reserve to continue operating. According to the family, the tax incentive will release funds which will enable them to employ more currently unemployed people to further improve the environment for the benefit of all species and significantly the Black Rhino, which will result in a greater game viewing experience for our lodge guests. This, in turn, will lead to a busier lodge and even further employment opportunities for the rural communities in our area.- -BIOFIN considers biodiversity tax incentives as one of the financial mechanisms that can be used to promote biodiversity conservation and bolster the biodiversity economy. The granting of a tax relief encourages landowners (communal and private) to use their land in a sustainable manner whilst reducing the costs associated with managing a protected area. Biodiversity tax incentives effectively enhance the financial effectiveness of South Africa’s protected areas and their compatible commercial activities. They aid in sustainable biodiversity and ecosystem management. This is essential to the longevity of these areas and the creation of broader biodiversity economy livelihoods, the effective growth of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs), and commercial operations linked to the wildlife economy. They also increase the protected area estate and area under responsible land management. Non-state investment in establishing and managing protected areas requires a suite of sustainable finance tools to mitigate management costs, offset loss of production income, increase land under protection, and ensure effective growth of enterprises engaged in the biodiversity economy.-BIOFIN recommends that South Africa continue to champion the use of biodiversity tax incentive in the growth of the biodiversity economy.

The Report was developed by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). -To determine alignment, all priorities and actions stated in the 13 programmatic chapters of the NDP are evaluated and compared with the 169 SDG targets as well as the 39 Agenda 2063 priority areas. The outcome from the mapping exercise was used to make an analysis of the alignment and gaps between the NDP, SDGs and Agenda 2063. Three sets of criteria were used to measure the impact/alignment of the NDP objectives to the SDG targets and Agenda 2063 priorities:-The results show that the NDP is 74% directly aligned to the SDGs.

-To overcome the widening digital divide and reduce inequality, poverty and unemployment, UNDP South Africa financed the pilot of CSIR’s TVWS technology and SMME support programme. This project will enable internet connectivity to 2400 users via public facilities and an additional 1600 users via public hotspots. Additional communities in KZN, Free State, and Western Cape will form part of this pilot.

Mdantsane Mobile, the SMME trained and tasked to implement the TVWS technology in Mdantanse was proud to launch the internet network. The CEO, Mr Songezo Mhambi, was honoured to be able to give back to his own community and participate in the project. Dr Luzango Pangani Mfupe, Principal Researcher at CSIR handed over the ownership certificate of the network infrastructure (built as part of the project), to Mdantsane Mobile. Ms Moodley highlighted that the provision of affordable internet access, particularly in rural areas is expected to play a role in South Africa’s economic recovery by enabling SMMEs to shift towards digital operations and enhance access to markets, finance and services that are required in a post COVID-19 economy and thereby empowering women and youth-owned businesses”-It is envisioned that a range of services will be made possible within selected pilot locations through the provision of internet, such as rural school connectivity, distance learning, remote information services (health/education/elections), Internet of Things (i.e. smart agriculture, smart villages), telemedicine, and E-Financial services. As part of UNDP’s endeavour to leave nobody behind, UNDP SA recently committed additional financial resources to scale this pilot project, expanding internet access through CSIR’s TVWS technology to an additional 10 communities across South Africa.
-As a development organization, UNDP extends an invitation to other stakeholders to foster strategic partnerships and jointly secure additional resources to help ensure that low-cost internet is rolled out to more communities around South Africa.  UNDP SA wishes for this project to touch the lives of those who need it the most. The hope is that this project goes beyond the provision of physical access, but enhances access to social, educational and economic opportunities. In so doing, the project aims to transform South Africa into a more equitable and prosperous society.

We must never forget that it is our duty to protect this environment - Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, President of South Africa (1994-1999)-Earlier this year, UNDP's Administrator, Achim Steiner announced that the joint proposal of UNDP and UNICEF Tanzania had won the Green Shark Innovation compettion, which was fantastic news for UNDP and UNICEF Tanzania. The competition was designed to spark creative thinking in youth and green recovery spaces. One of the innovative submissions was the WasteX Lab. The initiative includes an innovative strategy that uses a Centre of Excellence model to help expand solid waste management businesses that benefit underprivileged young women and youth. The project is being carried out on the Zanzibar islands of Unguja and Pemba. The funds will be used to encourage local stakeholders, particularly youth, to take part in a circular economy approach to trash management in collaboration with local municipalities, universities, government agencies, and the private sector.
-What is the issue? According to recent estimates, Africa generated 125 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2012, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for 81 million tonnes of that total (65 percent ). This is expected to rise to 244 million tonnes per year by 2025. With an average waste collection rate of only 55% (68 million tonnes), nearly half of Africa's MSW is dumped on sidewalks, open fields, stormwater drains, and rivers. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the average MSW collection rate is only 44 percent, with coverage varying greatly between cities, ranging from less than 20 percent to well above 90 percent. The continent's average MSW collection rate is expected to rise by only 69 percent by 2025.-Zanzibar is not an outlier in this regard. According to recent data, the main island of Unguja generates 663 tons of municipal solid waste per day. The Urban Municipal Council, West A and B municipal councils generate 216 tons of waste per day, accounting for half of the total waste on the island. However, only 120 tons are collected and disposed of. Massive amounts of uncollected garbage are dumped into the natural environment, endangering natural resources, harming the tourism industry, and providing an ideal breeding ground for flies and rats, which are carriers of a variety of diseases, including cholera, in slum areas in particular. Dumping solid waste clogs storm drains, causes urban flooding, and encourages garbage littering.-The good news is that nearly 80-90 percent of municipal solid waste in Sub-Saharan Africa is recyclable.
- -In response to these unfavorable circumstances, we created the WasteX lab (our initiative), which recognizes the inherent value of trash in the production of goods through recycling and upcycling. The assumption is that waste can be effectively managed and minimized by supporting innovative enterprises with a transactional model led by youth and young women.-WasteX leverages a center of excellence (COE), a shared facility focusing on circular economy technologies, to provide leadership, best practices, research, support, and training. In this case, UNDP, UNICEF, and their local partners are collaborating with a select group of enterprises, primarily youth and women, chosen through an innovation challenge to design and implement solutions to systemic challenges related to solid waste management in Zanzibar. Furthermore, the program will employ Human-Centered Design, Behavioral Science, and digital technologies to build a platform for peer-to-peer leadership, best practice sharing, experimentation, and business development.
-Furthermore, it will employ novel Social Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) strategies, including community education on waste management best practices. The behavioral component will be distributed to the community directly through appropriate channels, as well as through selected entrepreneurs who will act as community education ambassadors. In addition, an innovation challenge approach will be used to solicit existing solid waste innovation ecosystem solutions, which will serve as a catalyst for future innovation and scalability.
-This initiative is a direct response to Zanzibar's President's call to turn the islands into a blue economy powerhouse by 2050. It will design and deploy solutions to address systemic challenges related to solid waste management in Zanzibar, in line with the government's priority of institutional capacity building for waste management and combating land-based sources of marine pollution, marine litter, and microplastics.
-We invite all waste management stakeholders to join this movement as we assist Zanzibar's youth and young women in designing and deploying solutions to achieve zero waste status in Zanzibar and, ultimately, contribute to the accelerated achievement of Agenda 2030.

It is a report by the UNDP Accelerator Labs and Nesta's Centre for Collective Intelligence Design that surveyed the current state of the field and suggested key areas for action to make the most of the combined efforts of people, data, and technology. The report further highlighted what role traditional universities can play in realizing the potential of collective intelligence for the SDGs while building on what is already underway. The report explicitly highlights that: Universities could help build the skills and experience that graduates will need to work in a collectively intelligent way. Many are now using the ‘challenge-based’ model where, alongside their degree, students work on practical problem solving in teams that draw on multiple disciplines as well as insights outside of higher education.-In Tanzania, most university innovations or inventions come from two sources: (1) newly established innovation spaces and programs in some institutions, and (2) research projects undertaken by students as part of their academic degree requirements. During this time, the innovations nurtured in incubators/innovation spaces receive business development services (BDS) organized by institutions or partners, and in some cases, seed capital and technical assistance are provided to selected enterprises/innovators on a case-by-case basis. Some colleges and universities have formed Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to aid in the promotion of new ideas, and some students have even gone so far as to form their own businesses.-In Tanzania, most innovative businesses struggle to grow and remain viable due to  failure to commercialize research outputs or innovation products. Recent studies indicate that academic institutions are struggling with commercialization due to a variety of issues, including universities' inability to acquire resources to support infrastructure and early-stage funding for new technologies. University researchers and students also have a hazy understanding of the industrial environment and a lack of awareness of the market's dynamism, making it difficult to develop market-fit products with little traction and market penetration.- -Untangling the complexities of adversity: What is the Acc Lab doing?-In September 2020, UNDP Tanzania signed MOUs with the Nelson Mandela African Institution for Science and Technology (NM-AIST) and Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) through the Accelerator Lab programme.  Most of the technologies being incubated at NMAIST focus on up-scaling green technologies for climate change mitigation or adaptation, improved food and nutrition, data-driven solutions, and solutions related to information and communication technologies.-MUST, on the other hand, houses a Centre for Innovation and Technology Transfer (CITT). CITT's role is to bring and manage innovation, technology, and entrepreneurial development in Tanzania as well as Entrepreneurship and Business Management. In line with MUST's vision, the centre aims to help MUST achieve excellence in its primary operations of training, research, and consulting to Tanzanians and the global community.-Furthermore, in collaboration with the Accelerator Lab, the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) design studio decided in March 2020 to join hands with several techpreneurs in the innovation ecosystem to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The partnership included Bits & Bytes and Robotech (private sector), which were among the makers who collaborated with the studio at the time. In this endeavour, the AccLab worked with a ‘3D makers community' to design, fabricate, and distribute Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to frontline health workers around the country, notably those working in COVID-19 quarantine centres at the time. This was critical given the lack of medical supplies and specifically PPE for frontline health workers in Tanzania at the onset of the crisis. Our work on COVID19 has been featured in this blog published on Nest360 website.-But what’s more interesting about this dynamic engagement with academia is that, in a co-creation style (with the above-mentioned institutions), the lab encouraged a ""challenge-based"" model as a problem-solving approach to be adopted by innovation hubs inside the institutions. This approach has enabled university students to mix up with entrepreneurs, high school students, the private sector, and members of the non-profit sector to collaboratively re-imagine 21st century fast-paced challenges.-In most cases, programme participants are selected through a meticulous online application system where selection criteria are pre-determined. Solutions crafted are designed to respond to opportunities and prospects as indicated in respective regional investment guides – a UNDP supported blueprint providing investment information to prospective local and foreign investors with the aim of attracting them to exploit investment potential in the region in order to stimulate business and enterprise development as well as execute development pathways.- - As part of the MOUs, the lab assisted in redesigning the pre-incubation ""curriculum"" to accommodate a ""challenge-based"" model that allows for collaborative problem solving by tapping into the collective intelligence of non-academic groups such as entrepreneurs, non-profit actors, and lower-level students. Selected candidates undergo training in key innovation and business fields such as business modelling, human-centered design, digital marketing, and business pitching, to mention but a few.-So, what exactly have we seen so far?-Our immediate hope is that these solutions will find funding for their development, but we also expect that these innovators will move to become full-fledged business owners or entrepreneurs. Some notable solutions have recently emerged from this process, and some innovators have been able to concretize their business models. The following are examples of solutions we have seen so far:-·       Paulo Zebedayo Sulley-Gas-powered Poultry Egg Incubator-·       Scholastica M. Milanzi -Automated Home Security Systems-·       Amani Sadiki Mlipu -Foot operated hand washing machine-·       Anangisye Mwakyusa-IOT based Smart irrigation system-·       The Waluo Stove-Used car oil-powered stove-·       Ignas Mashauri-The agro-checker-Plant Disease detection App- -·       Edith Edward Lugela-Solar-powered automatic fish drier-·       Davis David Safari – Voice-controlled home appliances management system-·       Glory Owen Waane-Cashew nut processing machine made using local materials-·       Godfrey Steven Raymond-Automatic Potato Harvester-·       Anastazia Godwin Mbwaga–App-based digital library system for high schools- -·   Raymond, Jofrey –1) The Nutrano-A baby formula made from local ingredients. 2) The SimBar-A nutritious, healthy snack made from sesame seeds and 3) Fish feeds from local ingredients-·       Issakwisa Ngondya-Plant-based bio-herbicide and native plant seeding technique-·       Angela Mkindi-Plant-based pesticides for field insect pest management-·       Athanasia Matemu-Tomato Powder processing technique,1) Cashewnut Butter, 2)  Fermented African Nightshade, Athanasia Matemu3) Dried African Nightshade-·       Becky Nancy Aloo-Rhizobacter-based fertilizer for improved potato production-The above mentioned are some of the key solutions at a prototype stage; others not mentioned in this blog are still in the idea validation stage. As a program we are working to ensure that most of these solutions are mapped and uploaded to our online solutions database (work in progress), which can be found at https://innovate.co.tz/app/ to promote collaboration, partnerships, and attract potential investments.- -So, what comes next?-Redefining the role of R&D institutions in the advancement of digital and non-digital innovations is necessary to meet the 21st century's rapid development challenges. With Industry 4.0, digital innovation needs new skill sets. Universities in Tanzania and sub-Saharan Africa in general must evaluate their mechanisms for creating graduates that support the distinctive qualities of digital technologies to create dynamic innovation scholars. Research and development organizations must keep up with the rapid changes in technology and the job market.-So, what are the next steps for these solutions? You may be wondering; the truth is that the need to find a suitable path for product commercialization is pressing. These institutions mentioned in this blog are trying to do just that, combining academic excellence with business intelligence from outside of university campuses. To ensure the success and sustainability of university-based innovative businesses, we must develop strong business cases for these products. It is our conviction that universities can be supported in a variety of ways to assist with market entry for their innovative businesses. 1) Financing for innovation2) carrying out a scientific situational analysis3) Improving cross-sector collaboration and partnerships 4) Experimentation using a ""challenge-based model"" and collaborative problem solving, and 5) advocating for intellectual property protection and promotion at the institutional level and beyond.-At the time of writing, the UNDP Accelerator lab in Tanzania  teamed up with the FUNGUO-a newly launched programme for innovation run in partnership with the European Union (EU), the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), and the Tanzanian Commission of Science and Technology to solicit the services of a consulting firm or consortium of individual consultants to carry out a feasibility study for the commercialization of research outputs and innovations coming out of Tanzanian higher learning institutions. The study results are expected to inform UNDP’s and its partners’ programmes and contribute to the public dialogues on the subject.-We call for increased collaboration and partnerships, particularly in fostering the academia-industry nexus in this space, to support the commercialization of research outputs and innovative products, so that graduates (mostly young people) can be job creators rather than job seekers, while also working to accelerate the achievement of global goals.-Missed our previous blog?

In our previous blog, we discussed how we used Twitter data to train  some deep learning models to effectively evaluate the extent of online misinformation on the COVID19 pandemic. In this experiment we will use web scraping techniques to extract, apply data analytics method to clean, annotate, analyze, interpret, and visualize data from popular tourists’ websites to gather feedback by visitors coming to the islands of Unguja and Pemba in Zanzibar. We will finally train a deep learning model with the cleaned data for automatic analysis.-The Problem-Zanzibar is endowed with cultural, historic, natural, and man-made tourism features that have the potential to transform it into an up-market and competitive tourist destination in the Indian Ocean archipelagoes. It is the main industry that connects all other economic sectors. The tourism industry in Zanzibar accounts for approximately 27 percent of GDP and generates more than $400 million in revenue. COVID-19 has arisen several economic, social, and environmental challenges that are hindering private investment and the ease of doing business in Zanzibar's tourism sector. The key challenges include under capacitated institutions in the sector, lack of professional competence and crumbling infrastructures, to name a few. However, for the purposes of this experiment, we have focused our efforts on determining the problem of lower returning rate of tourists after first visit to the islands.-The 2017 International Visitor Exit Study showed that the majority of the top 15 Zanzibar source markets with the exception of Kenya were first time visitors to the islands, with repeat visitors accounting for just around 14 percent of the total, as indicated in the chart below:-We plan to collect data on a variety of tourism-related topics, including hotel listings, location data, aviation data, and review and feedback data, to name a few. Scraping visitor opinions and reviews from social media, customer portals, online communities, and forums.-About web scrapping-Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of gathering information from the internet in an efficient manner. It does not entail repetitive typing or copy-pasting. Web scraping tools work by searching for the required data, compiling it, and storing it on a computer. Web scraping, as opposed to screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data is stored in a database. After that, the scraper can replicate the entire website's content elsewhere.-You may wonder, why data scraping? the truth is that a tourist’s travel decision is influenced by a variety of complex factors. Social media and travel review websites are the most important of these, so let us dissect this new online travel industry. On the one hand, there are travel e-commerce websites that sell travel products like hotels, flights, and car rentals. You can either buy these products and services directly from the company's website or use an online travel agent. On the other hand, there are travel review websites where travelers can share their hotel or service experiences.-In essence, our work, will focus more on review websites to tap into the collective intelligence produced by groups of visitors in the islands. The advantage of this process is that it saves time, gives easy access to data, reduces effort to collect data and is relatively accurate.-In its best simplicity, web/data scrapping can be illustrated as follows:-The Process-This experiment is split into two parts: In the first phase, we will: 1) collect data via web scraping by identifying URLs of targeted sites, 2) prepare a Python environment for scraping, and 3) identify key features to be scrapped. Furthermore, the team will begin data cleaning and transformation, which will include: 1) the removal of non-textual data, language translation, reformatting data time parameters, and visualization of numerical parameters; and finally, the team will begin training and testing the data, which will include sentiment identification for labeling and training data, as well as pre-processing (tokenization, vocabulary building).-The second phase will include several steps, that are: 1) building and configuring a sentiment analysis model, 2) training data, identifying metrics, and evaluating the test data set's mode. In addition, the team will use the model to classify the extracted data into defined sentiments (labels), visualize the prediction results and existing location information and extract key topics.-Next Steps-In Tanzania, the use of computer technology, particularly techniques such as web scraping to help inform various socioeconomic challenges in the development sector is still in its early stages of development. However, we are witnessing several tech initiatives in the innovation ecosystem that are utilizing the computer technology and various Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as AI, virtual reality, mobile apps, and so on to address some of the most complex challenges of our time.-We believe that the findings of this experiment will not only provide a compelling case for the adoption of this technology in tourism programming circles but will also help to inform various development strategies and policies. We anticipate that the results of this experiment will be beneficial to the government of Zanzibar through the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism (ZCT) with key novel feedback data that will support re-branding or marketing of the Islands which will eventually lead to an increased number of returning visitors.-We call for more partners to join us to re-imagine development as we make use of computer programmes to provide solutions to some of the most complex challenges of our time.-Missed our previous blog?

Now, we are sharing it back!']","Posted on September 7, 2021","A recent report by the  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) indicated that the African continent produced over 125milion tonnes of  municipal solid waste (MSW). This quantity is expected to increase two-fold by 2025. The average MSW collection rate stood at 55 percent, while 90 percent of waste is disposed on uncontrolled dumpsites and landfills. 55 percent of waste generated was organic which could offer significant socio-economic opportunities for countries. Furthermore, It is estimated that 70–80 percent of the MSW generated in Africa is recyclable, yet only 4 percent of MSW is currently recycled. Overall, the   system is characterized with the existence of informal waste pickers who are vigorously recouping valuable resources from waste at minimal to no cost to municipalities or private companies (aggregators).-Africa is currently recycling only 4% of its waste -As elucidated in our previous blog on solid waste management in Tanzania, Mwanza city located on the northern part of the country is no exception, recent estimates indicated that the city produced over 350 tonnes of waste per day out which it is estimated that 70 percent contained organic waste. At the time of writing, the municipal waste management system was supported by four private companies who act as aggregators and five community-based waste collection services. However, the city faced several challenges that threatened to overwhelm the existing waste management system including low investment, a lack of recycling facilities and the growth of informal settlements with unmapped waste management infrastructure. In 2020, the City Council planned to expand its modern waste collection services to new wards. The UNDP Accelerator Lab and its partner Open Map Development (OMD) stepped in to help the city to further understand the problem by using collective intelligence approaches by tapping into the power of crowd and open data.-The Process-The Lab used satellite data and crowd mapping to create an overview of the production and collection of waste in Mwanza’s Buhongwa ward, a peripheral neighborhood with many informal settlements. The lab partnered with OpenMap Development Tanzania (OMDTZ), to run a virtual mapathon with ten local university students using the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap platform. Over multiple sessions in the space of two weeks, students (volunteers) labeled buildings, roads, and waterways in the Buhongwa ward, as well as identifying possible trash sites. The resulting dataset was verified by the GIS team at OMDTZ.-Results-Through virtual mapathons, the Lab generated a novel dataset about the core infrastructure of Buhongwa ward, mapping over 26,000 features such as roads, waterways, buildings, and trash sites. The data revealed the existence of new buildings that had previously not been registered by government officials. This information is being used by the city’s Environment and Sanitation department to add waste collection points to serve the previously unmapped informal settlements.-'Data Share back' Sessions-‘Data Share back’ – a phrase adopted from Tanzania’s Data zetu initiative refers to a practice of collecting a tremendous amount of data about people and their communities and decide to ‘share back’ with the very people who produced it. In our case, the sessions were conducted at both regional and ward level government aiming at empowering and showcasing the power of data in enhancing decision-making to local government leaders and community members and furthermore to demonstrate how Satellite imagery and Open Data can be used to improve waste management. Key participants in the sessions included representatives from various departments at city council, private sector, innovators, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and political leaders. At the ward level, the sessions included the ward government representatives and a selection of community members who participated during data collection.- In essence, the sessions aimed at; 1) Developing an understanding of the community mapping Concept 2) Develop a functional understanding of Quantum-GIS, OpenStreetMap, open data, data collection tools and lastly, build capacity to stylize maps in QGIS. For community members (many non-professionals) the intent was to capacitate them to make sense of the results and offer them an opportunity to propose alternative pathways towards improving waste management.-We learned that the ‘Data share back’ exercise added lots of value to actors in solid waste and the community members who participated at large, as one local government leader remarked: “This exercise has not only increased our capacity to collect, analyse and interpret data but also it has shown the  value of involving community members in various development interventions’’ — Mr. Adam Maluzuku, Ward Executive officer, Buhongwa, Mwanza-Looking foward-As Michael Cañares argued in his blog on data empowerment-people whose data were collected must be accorded with the rights to the data and must be empowered to work on them. He furthermore expounded that people must have the right to know where their data goes, have a say on who uses it and be able to reclaim this right. This also includes the right to privacy and the right to be protected from risks online.  -But why do we do all this? - as a UN based accelerator, our mission is to bring ‘unusual suspects’  such as local innovators and  community members (usually left out in the development planning process) to the programming space and indorse the use of new sources of data and technologies to discourse the ever-increasing societal challenges. we seek to add value by; 1) Solidifying legitimacy in the innovation ecosystem and the policy arena, 2) Convening across sectors of the economy and 3) elevating new problem solvers in both the urban and rural settings.-In the end, we believe that data collected from initiatives such as this, will help the municipal council improve the waste management programming processes by; attracting the private sector to find potential areas for investment in the solid waste space, increase partnerships and collaboration and encourage experimentation.-The MSW initiative has a downstream to UNDP Tanzania’s past efforts to provide technical and financial support to the city of Mwanza  to develop its own investment guide- a blue print providing  investment information to prospective local and foreign investors. Furthermore, Accelerator Lab’s engagement with local innovators aims at sourcing a potential pipeline for the newly launched catalytic fund for innovation know as @Funguo_Tz -a programme run in partnership with the European Union (EU), Foreign, Commonwealth &Development Office (FCDO) and the Commission of Science of Technology, Tanzania.-This is just the beginning of a long voyage by the Accelerator Lab in working with complex systems and in this case in  addressing the Sustainable Development Goal twelve which focuses on ensuring responsible consumption and production.-Please, Join us in this movement as we work towards improving service delivery in Tanzania by making use of data produced as a result of collective intelligence methods and approaches.-Missed our previous blog?

It furthermore added that - Like the virus, it is highly contagious and grows exponentially. It also complicates COVID-19 pandemic response efforts.-“We’re not just battling the virus,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.”-Responding to this, the Accelerator Lab in Tanzania together with its partner  Xsense AI designed an experiment to conduct web scrapping on Twitter  data to understand the extent of misleading information related to COVID-19 in Tanzania, this exercise was conducted right after the first patient was identified in the country. The exercise intended to develop data sets that authorities can use to develop communication messages related to the pandemic. We used Kinondoni district in Dar Es Salaam region as a pilot.
-We extracted data produced in four consecutive days, resulting to 20,422 related tweets. 10,000 tweets were used to train our deep learning model. We used popular model for Natural Language Pre-processing (NLP), the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The tweets were labelled as either COVID or NON-COVID. To account for misinformation, the dataset was further labelled as INFORMED and MISINFORMED on tweets related to COVID.  By using the trained deep learning model, we were able to automatically classify the remaining 10,422 data into the four categories, namely COVID, NON- COVID, INFORMED, and MISINFORMED.
- -On the overall analysis of the pulled tweets, the top 20 most discussed topics on twitter. Figure 2F shows COVID-19 related words were the most dominating words on twitter within the Kinondoni district. In both of our pulled tweets from 21st to 24th April, was dominated with the word “GOD”, as it can be seen in Figure 2, A-E. Also, figure 2, E which plotted the overall discussed topics on Twitter, still the name ""GOD"", dominated the tweets posted and retweeted. 
-Figure 2: The top 20 most common spoken words on twitter, 21st-24th April 2020.-Figure 3 below shows the trend of COVID-19 related tweets against other tweets in four days, April 21st -24th, 2020. Although people continued to tweet about other issues, COVID related tweets contributed an average of 11.8% to the discussed topics. The number of retweets and likes COVID related tweets received further tell the extent to how much COVID related posts occupied online conversations.
-In our analysis of tweets originating within Kinondoni district, we found that more than 18% were discussing COVID-19 as shown in figure 3 A.
- -Although information on prevention and care was provided through other channels, we tried to find out how informed this community was based on incoming tweets. In this regard, we checked how well people were informed about CORONAVIRUS/COVID-19 by performing sentiment analysis on the posted tweets. We found a relatively higher percentage (12.4%) of all tweets related to COVID seemed not informed about the pandemic out of all 2413 COVID related tweets we pulled based on WHO guidance.-Conclusion-Our ability to create an Artificial Intelligence algorithm that can perform sentiment analysis of the data has set a proof that we can automate the process on how the analysis of social media data can be done. The detection of most trending topics, shows that social media data analysis can be used as an early detection tool for situations like epidemics and disasters for early intervention. Although social media data pose a risk of being a major source information, our ability to detect this can be used in taking countermeasures in combating the problem of misinformation. At the time of writing the country office was planning to support the government of Zanzibar through Zanzibar Commission for Tourism to conduct web scrapping on popular tourists websites to understand the problem of lower rate of returning tourists after first visit to the islands.-Note: This analysis was based only on the English tweets. This is because of absence of Swahili digital libraries Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning applications. This blog argues for the need of collection of machine learning ready Swahili dataset, to be able to include swahili in digital platforms.-Missed our previous blog?

Focusing on SDG 12, we crafted an experiment by using uncommon ways of understanding problems, seeking solutions and finally learning and adapting in a specific context. This blog summarizes some of the results from an experiment conducted in collaboration with our partner Open Map Development in the  Mwanza City Council. The exercise targeted at testing whether ‘unconventional’ data sources such as open data  and satellite imagery  could be used  in solid waste management programming at the local government setting in Tanzania. This blog culminates a three-part series written during the project, the first two parts covered; Design Thinking and use of satellite imagery.-How did we do it?-To undertake this task we went through the following steps-1) Developed qualitative/quantitative questionnaires and uploaded them in the ODK (Open Data Kit)  app platform-2) Piloted the platform-3) trained about 30 community volunteers on how to use ODK collect app (downloaded for IOS and android)-4) Rolled out (data collection) 5) Data analysis and visualization and 6) Data sharing (Via webinar). See results in the above image and subsequent images below.- -Reflections-The advent of the 4IR in Africa brought forward an array of technological opportunities such as open Data, Satellite Imagery and Mobile Apps which were used in this project – most uniquely as a Collective Intelligence project, we deliberately engaged a variety of actors to tap into various capacities and capabilities to solve or address complex challenges such as improper solid waste management. We recruited community members to help with data collection and interpretation of results and volunteers to remotely run a mapathon and produce imagery at such a short timeframe compared with conventional survey methods.-As a programme, we seek to; 1)  convene various actors in the development spectrum 2) inform policy or programming  and  also elevating new problem solvers in both urban and rural settings – The intention is to scale these type of solutions and  create an impact.-At the time of writing, lessons from this project resulted into a potential project by UNDP  country office in collaboration with the UNWTO to support the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism (ZCT) ( an institution of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar) to use Satellite imagery to find uncharted tourist attractions in the semi-autonomous Islands of Zanzibar in Tanzania as part of COVID-19 recovery and resilience efforts.-For more inforamtion about UNDP accelerator programme visit: https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org/-By Peter Nyanda, team Lead and Head of Exploration, UNDP Accelerator Lab Tanzania","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,United Republic of Tanzania ,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Collective Intelligence,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The country benefits from a diverse production base that includes livestock, staple food crops and a variety of cash crops. The sector’s contribution to GDP is 28.7% (2017), this has more than tripled in the last 10 years, supported by rising cash crop production, an emerging agro-processing segment and strong domestic demand for processed food. Source-The sector remains an economic mainstay and the largest source of employment, with the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) reporting in the FYDP 2016/17-2020/21 that 67% of the workforce is engaged in agriculture. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that 11.3m people participated in agricultural activities during the 2014/15 season. Roughly 60% of operators were involved in crop production, 38% in crop and livestock activities, and 2% were solely engaged in livestock production.-At the same time, farmers and other sector stakeholders face considerable challenges in modernising the industry to increase yields, exports and value-added processing. Slowing export revenues; land acquisition hurdles; and smallholder farmers struggling to access economically viable technology, adequate storage facilities, markets and credit have affected private investment.
-These challenges need to be addressed through joint efforts from multiple actors. Towards the end of 2019, UNDP Tanzania accelerator lab has been trying to address the challenge of market access to small holder farmers. The key question for the Accelerator Lab was which digital technology can be applied to transform the sector?-As Head of Solutions Mapping for the Accelerator Lab, I mapped and analysed several solutions but to most of the solutions the challenge has been coverage, a majority of them are designed for farmers who can afford a smartphone and internet. Although mobile data prices are reasonably low, they remain unaffordable to segments of the rural population. This has resulted in a large gap in internet use between urban and rural areas. Also, fewer women than men access and use the Internet.-An online trading platform to connect the most remote and vulnerable farmers-In my search for solutions I came across one solution which I consider to be novel to a majority of farmers; the online trading platform for trading agricultural commodities engineered and managed by Tanzania Mercantile Exchange Market (TMX) which operates in accordance with the Commodity Exchanges Act 2015 and Commodity Exchanges Regulations, 2016. https://bit.ly/34GEGa6-Establishment of TMX is part of the government’s efforts to digitalize government services which is now advancing, and the Government is investing more resources to enhance the overall business environment. Despite this, Tanzania has yet to adopt a stand-alone e-commerce policy or strategy, and e-commerce is not mainstreamed into the national or sectoral trade development strategies https://bit.ly/3nyR2JV

- -The TMX online trading platform has capacity to connect a majority of rural based smallholder farmers to regional and domestic markets without additional costs on mobile data as it connects to the warehouse system. Farmers, through farmers cooperatives send their produce to a nearby registered warehouse and from here information is sent to the online platform. All cereals can easily be traded through this platform and can help farmers to overcome exploitative systems such as selling crops before harvest, selling without using the right standardized weighing equipment, reducing transportation bottlenecks, improving the system of tax collection and tariffs that are set by laws and regulations yet the full functioning of the online platform experienced a lot of hiccups due to lack of trust on its performance by key decision makers.-The Accelerator Lab thought of financing a workshop to provide an  opportunity for key stakeholders involved to perform live testing of the online trading platform for them to understand how the system works and gain their confidence in using the platform, this was not done before by TMX.-How we used collective intelligence -data, people and technology to unlock the online platform?-The UNDP Tanzania Accelerator Lab convened a day and half workshop and invited participants who are key decision makers from the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance and planning, crop board Directors with Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Planning as the chief guest.  During the workshop participants performed live testing of the online platform imitating buyers (testing the technology), evidence of competitive prices from piloting phase was shared (data) and discussions (people’s reactions) triggered decision to allow more crops to be traded online including cotton, sisal, Cashewnut and cereals. For a majority of participants this was their first-time exposure to interact with the online market platform and an opportunity to understand e-commerce. Seeing is believing!-Two months later following a stakeholders workshop the government gave public notice that more cereal crops will be traded via the TMX e-platform. This is how we have been able to amplify e-commerce in the agricultural sector which builds on other country office efforts and support in the Agriculture sector such as the design of Mobile-Kilimo http://mkilimo.esrf.or.tz/ under RARIS project funded by Melinda Gates Foundation which connects farmers to markets and extension services via USSD code. The big lesson for us is that bringing in new ways of addressing complex challenges is innovation in   itself and is what mostly needed to make an impact. The Accelerator lab will continue to work with TMX to integrate innovative ways or technologies to improve quality including blockchain for source tracking.-For more information about the UNDP accelerator programme visit: https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org/-By Ghati Horombe, Head of Solution Mapping, UNDP Accelerator Lab Tanzania","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 1  No poverty,United Republic of Tanzania ,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Collective Intelligence,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Star Wars? Curiosity or Apollo missions?-of course these words have almost become synonymous with space and its technologies and most definitely with satellite as a Geographic Information Systems technology which has  become an essential tool for monitoring long and short term land use practices as a result of human activities on the Earth’s surface. Indeed, not so common in our slice of the world but we are undoubtedly observing an upsurge of its usage to address various 21st century fast-paced developmental challenges such as climate change and its effects.-Perhaps you are also asking yourself, how then is this related to solid waste? Well, in  this  blog - a sequel to our  previous work on Design Thinking, we explored how the City of Mwanza in Tanzania intended to use new sources of data to inform its solid waste management operations-  that allowed the Accelerator Lab in Tanzania to think of  setting  the stage for experimentation on using innumerable and novel  4.0 related technologies such as satellite imagery. The idea behind was to find out on how the technology can enable actors in the solid waste value chain to utilize these novel sources of data that have probably never been used before to improve solid waste management. Ultimately, through a partnership model the lab programme aims at testing and scaling these innovative solutions to influence development programming, government policy or spinoffs into independent ventures.-The problem-A recent report by the world bank estimates that  cities around the world  generated as high as 2.01 Bilion tones a year, this was equivalent to 0.74kg kgs per person per day.  Due to high rates of solid waste generation, an annual increase of 70% to 3.40bilion tones in 2050 is expected.  In sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that over 90% of produced waste is often disposed on unregulated dumps or openly burnt. Improper waste management can lead to stern health and environmental hazards. When waste is not properly managed it contributes to global climate change through methane generation, serves a breeding ground for vectors and can even promote urban violence. As elucidated in our recent blog on design thinking, the city of Mwanza ( Where this project is undertaken) produced around 350tonnes of waste a day (almost 70% is organic), there is less investment in circularity and use of technology in the system. To conduct this experiment, we selected Buhongwa ward- a semi urban, peripheral location with high rural-urban migration rate, furthermore, the ward has a rough population of thirty thousand inhabitants and hosts the largest vegetable market in the region. Solid waste management structure in this ward is relatively informal with less or no investment in refuse collection or recycling. The ward also houses the largest sanitary landfill in the region, waste re-use and scavenging activities are evident.-How did we approach the assignment?-The UNDP accelerator lab partnered with Open Map Development Tanzania- a  non-profit based in Tanzania that uses various GIS technologies to create innovative solutions for various developmental challenges, furthermore, we  engaged  volunteer students  from Ardhi University. The students’ role in the assignment was to conduct virtual digitization (mapathon)- an approach used  due to travel restrictions as a result of COVID 19 pandemic eruption.-The following steps were undertaken; 1) creation of  a task on the open street map platform www.tasks.hotosm.org to divide the pilot area into several squares for mapping 2)open imagery sources such as Bing and Maxar were used 3)mapped images were reviewed and validated by a GIS expert 4)data was finally uploaded on the OpenStreetMap platform.- -As a result of this virtual exercise the team was able to map 26,255 buildings, roads, waterways, and possible trash sites were identified as seen on figure 2 above. All maps can be seen accessed for free on the Open Street Map platform. This information will be complemented by a physical validation of all mapped structures and a mini survey to understand the community practices related to solid waste management in the ward. Indeed, the exercise produced a new set of data that never existed before; as the city’s head of Environment and Sanitation Department puts it;-‘we were not aware that this ward has so many buildings, we usually relied on large scale surveys which are protracted and expensive, this information will also be useful to our revenue collection department’ - Mr. D. Kamenya,2020- - -Next steps
-Towards completion of this assignment the team will embark on, rapid validation of buildings, waterways and trash sites identified. Technically, the team will conduct a mini survey by using ODK collect app to understand;1) the community perceptions towards waste management and 2) conduct trash mapping.-It is anticipated that towards the end of this phase we will produce; 1) heat maps which shows the extent of illegal dumping  2) produce waste route wasting analysis report – a narrative which will allow aggregators to efficiently plan waste collection points positioning and 3) develop  an interactive map on OSM platform which will allow  crowdsourcing of further geospatial information related to the ward.-Looking on a bigger picture, outputs of this assignment will complement efforts by Tanzania country office to; 1) strategical support the city of Mwanza in attracting long and short term investments in its diverse resource endowments- and most importantly in this case pulling investors in circularity business and 2) to enable the city council to scale out the project to other wards for the purposes of improving its service delivery and potentially reach its goal of becoming a smart city in the near future and finally a virtual webinar will be organized to share results with a wider innovation ecosystem audience.-Drawing inspiration from Elon’s quote above, use of satellite imagery is quite a new phenomenon across most of the sub-Saharan countries, however we are optimistic that by presenting use cases such as this will enable municipalities, waste management companies ( aggregators), policy makers, statisticians and development experts in general  to find value on presented information and ultimately utilize it on a wider scale. We will wait to see that ‘probability’ emerge or perhaps we are seeing it already?-Missed our previous blog?

Experiences from Tanzania,200,"['UNDP Tanzania', 'Blog', 'Can Design Thinking help understand Solid Waste Management Systems? Experiences from Tanzania']","Posted on July 16, 2020","Earlier this year, the UNDP Tanzania Accelerator lab embarked on an exciting collective intelligence odyssey to engage  the Mwanza Municipal Council’s environment department team to help re-imagine the city’s solid waste management systems by using design thinking methods and processes in the quest to  find  solutions that  will upsurge its efficiency. As we began this journey, we were fully  cognizant of the fact that the UNDP country office had  provided technical and financial support to the City Council to develop its own investment guide- a blue print providing  investment information to prospective local and foreign investors for the aim of attracting them to exploit investment potentials in the region in order to stimulate business and enterprise development as well as executing development pathways. This assignment being one of the major undertakings since the Acc Lab was established, we could not wait to see how the unfolding complementarity between the entity and other country office initiatives could bring, especially in waste management.-Mwanza is the second largest city in Tanzania after Dar -es Salaam and one of the fastest developing urban centres in Sub-Saharan Africa, a report by the World Economic Forum placed it on a list of 15 fastest growing cities in the world.  It is located on the spectacular southern shores of Lake Victoria in Northwest of Tanzania. It covers an area of 1,337 square out of these 71.55 km2 (28%) is covered by water and the remaining 184.9 km2 (72%) is dry land. Approximately 86.8 Km2 is urbanized while the remaining areas consist of forested land, valleys, cultivated plains, grassy and undulating rocky hill.-The problem and opportunity-According to the city’s official records, Mwanza city generated 357 Tonnes of solid waste per day, of which 70% comprised organic waste. Despite relatively good collection system, it is faced with numerous challenges including shortage of sufficient transport facilities, low investment in collection system, lack of recycling systems, emerging electronic waste problem and absence of system-based approach for disaggregating solid waste into different components. Furthermore, there is minimal community awareness on good solid waste management practices also unwillingness of some users to pay service fee for refuse collection. Moreover, rapid population increase and urban concentration, financial and technological limitations, fast increasing informal settlements and illegal dumping of waste are among top challenges. At the time of writing the City Council had contracted four private companies (aggregators) and 5 community-based organisations dealing with waste collection.-As we undertook this mission, the key questions we had in mind were; what methods or techniques can we use to invoke novel and creative ideas towards solving the problem (s)? How can we get the users of the system involved in the thinking process? How can we analyse the systems, policies, and procedures in place?, Who are the main actors?, Is technology embedded in the system?, Can we use new sources of data to inform the problem?, Can the players in the system think innovation or rather think different?- -On design Thinking...
- So, what is ‘Design Thinking’? - In brief; design thinking is an iterative process in which we thrive to understand the user’s pain, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, to create new strategies and solutions. Opposed to “Brainstorming”, Design thinking promotes “Pain storming”, to fully understand the user’s pain. The usual Design thinking phases are as follows; 1) Empathize with your users 2) Define your users’ needs, their problem, and your insights 3) Ideate by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions 4) Prototype to start creating solutions 5) Test solutions-Furthermore, according to Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO- a global design company- www.ideo.com-“Design thinking is a human-cantered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”-What did we do exactly?-The city’s environment department helped us with identifying the  key actors involved in the waste value chain in the region including; aggregators ( waste collecting companies), community based organisations (CBOs)  involved in waste management, big recycling companies, local recyclers such as bio-briquettes makers, political leaders and users from various wards and of course the city council’s management.-As a UN based Innovation lab our goal is three fold; 1) convening different actors across the innovation ecosystem and especially the ‘unusual suspects’ such as techpreneurs or local innovators that are normally left out in the conventional development programming process, 2) legitimizing new sources of data or information that would otherwise be ignored; and 3) enable wider level adaptation of technologies or new ways of doing business to inform policy or development programming at different levels of government.-So, in this case; a group comprising municipal waste experts, private sector, innovators and members of the civil society and users were invited to take a five days journey through a workshop modality ( as seen in this tweet) to re-visit the existing waste management system in the region, specifically in the wards (administrative unit smaller than a district) managed by the city council. To do this, the group tackled the challenge by going through the following steps.-1)     Empathize- Meticulous highlight of regional level  solid waste management status was done including a highlight of  successes and challenges, on the other hand accelerator lab approaches and design methods were explained. The group went to a solution safari in various wards to observe how the community is coping with challenges related to solid waste management. Despite a relatively good level of waste management - majority of residents in semi-urban wards and islands are not an integral part of the waste collection system and therefore end up using multiple local methods of waste disposal e.g. burning. The group was also able to observe first-hand the intricacies of mismanaged solid waste and later immersed in the community to learn the coping mechanisms employed as local solutions by the community such as re-use and organic waste recycling using traditionally made equipments e.g. bio-briquettes drying box and carbonizers as referenced in this Acc Lab past blog.-2)     DEFINE- In this stage, a long list of possible causes to the problems analysed and synthesised them  to define the core problems as observed to make they observed and later by using various methods such as needs analysis, stakeholder mapping, the futures wheel and headlines of tomorrow exercise, the group forecasted the future they wished  to see without being biased.-3)     IDEATE- here, they split into small groups and generated as many ideas as possible they used various techniques such as Worst Possible Idea and SCAMPER to help them think outside the box.-4)     PROTOTYPE- selection of the best inexpensive and scaled down ideas and prototype them by building cardboard models of their solutions in ten minutes. Examples of solutions that came up included automated waste bins, online payment system, local material recovery facility, trash mapping application and local bio-briquette machinery to mention but a few.-5)     TEST- The last day of the session was dedicated to testing all of these solutions while engaging the  users- even though it was quite early to see the results of  most of the solutions, by far most community members and actors agreed to most of the solutions as a result of this process, as per below testimonies;-‘It is quite gloomy that we spend a lot of resources to transfer organic waste to the landfill, a big percentage of this type of waste could be reduced if recycling was done at home to produce fertiliser’ Mr. Desderius Polle, landfill Manager, Mwanza-‘We need to integrate various technologies in the solid waste management system, this will enable us to save resources, increase landfill lifespan and create employment’ Mr. Fanuel Kasenene, Environment officer, Mwanza city Council- -It was quite amazing how hastily group developed various ideas to address most of the challenges embedded in the waste value chain. As the mission ended, the group came up with various proposals including; 1) create a viable environment for small businesses engaged in recycling by providing guarantees and supporting processes to improve bankability; 2) attract investors in material recovery plant installation and production of compost fertiliser; 3) employ various collective intelligence methods to understand the problem in semi-urban wards e.g. use of unusual sources of data such as satellite data; 4) encourage learning from successful projects elsewhere; 4) run a hackathon to crowdsource ideas that use technology to improve solid waste management systems 5) convene and elevate local solid waste innovators by building a local Innovation forum.-Using Design Thinking was quite an exciting and engaging process, it also helped us learn the potentials of a circular economy in the sub-Saharan setting such as this. Obviously, continuous engagement with various actors such as the private sector and local innovators will eventually build a strong foundation for a vibrant circular economy in Tanzania. Hopefully, lessons from this session will trigger debate and action on the role of local solutions in addressing wider systemic problems such as those embedded in the solid waste system in the city of Mwanza and eventually the entire country.-For more information about the UNDP accelerator programme visit: https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org/-By Peter Nyanda, Team lead and Head of exploration, UNDP accelerator lab Tanzania","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Blog post,United Republic of Tanzania ,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Design Thinking,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Apparently, the African continent is no exception in this, see updates: https://africacdc.org/covid-19/.  Even though infection rates may seem trivial for a continent of 1.2 Billion people and a country of approximately 56 million people, truth is- you can never underestimate the aggressive nature of a deadly contagion such as COVID-19. Undeniably, the COVID onslaught has been the biggest test to development practioners and actors across many continents.  In Tanzania, it offers yet again a realization that we probably need to do things differently, furthermore, it upholds a testament to the contention purporting to the irrelevance of 20th century development methods to address systematic risks of the 21st century such as hunger, diseases, inequality, mass surveillance, Unemployment etc.-Across the world and in Tanzania, there is an upsurge of multiple solutions in responding to the COVID -19 pandemic such as tackling misinformation, virtual food vending platforms, clinical robots, automated hand washers, etc. But what do we see? Personally, I see  more bubbling ideas from the innovation ecosystem and less from conventional development actors, such as NGOs and CBOs, as Gina et al put it in their blog ‘ The planet is burning. But what are we learning?’ https://bit.ly/3dmPNs2 - Agile appears to be having a moment!-It is from this backdrop that  UNDP accelerator lab in Tanzania decided in March this year to join hands with various techpreneurs in the Innovation  ecosystem to respond to the crisis by supporting a ‘3D makers community’ in designing, fabrication and distribution of Personal, Protective Equipment (PPEs) to support protecting front line health workers across the country especially those serving in quarantine centers for COVID-19 patients-Bringing together unusual partners.-Partnership is one of the key precepts of UNDP’s accelerator lab programme. In Tanzania we seek to bring the ‘unusual suspects’ in the development space and promote the use of new sources of data and technologies to address the ever-increasing societal challenges; we seek to add value by; 1)Strengthening legitimacy in the ecosystem 2) Convening across sectors of the economy and 3) elevating new problem solvers by finding and tapping individual problem solvers in the urban and rural settings.- -The Accelerator Lab in Tanzania in this case, reached out to a new set of innovators that could help to  address an imminent threat posed by the invasion of COVID-19; given the fragile nature of many African health systems-the problem of inadequate medical supplies and especially Personal Protective Equipment for front line health workers immediately popped up. Furthermore, Through various exploratory visits in the past, I had come across  various maker spaces in the city of Dar Es Salaam where the UNDP office is located and therefore it was a no brainer to reach out to the ‘makers community’ and later the  Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) design studio — a government Lab housed at the Dar Es Salaam institute of Technology, co-funded by Rice 360° Institute for Global Health (USA).- Indeed, UNDP accelerator lab joined the movement to provide technical and financial support in the design, fabrication and testing of appropriate technologies for Tanzania. This includes collaboration on 3D printing capabilities, supply of PPEs and other innovations towards the fight against COVID-19. The DIT design studio at the time had informally joined hands with other labs and makers such as the Science Technology and Innovation Center Lab (STIC), Uhuru labs, Mbeya University of Science and Technology (Government owned), Bits&bytes (Private) and Robotech (Private). This unusual mix of government institutions and private hubs attracted me the most because I firmly believe that solutions are better crafted in a unison.-On 3D printing.-Check out this hyperlink for more details on 3D technology https://bit.ly/36Qemec-As a fourth Industrial revolution (4IR) technology is cheaper, faster, convenient and reliable and very suitable for production processes in times of crisis such as this. UNDP’s motivation to step in the innovation ecosystem and in this case in a 4IR technology such as 3D printing is due to the realization that we are facing a challenge that requires agility and quick decision making as opposed to the conventional way of getting things done.- -Just to share the nitty gritties of how the process worked; I reached out to the ‘makers community’ -a name coined to refer to 3D printing labs across the country- I was so humbled by how the community was content to have UNDP accelerator lab as a partner and leader in the process, after various engagements the following transpired;-a) We undertook crowd sourcing of 3D printers across Tanzania, COVID-19 treatment and quarantine locations. ( about 12 printers were solicited)-b) Printers were vetted, and we selected a few which were supplied with DIY kits.-c) Two Maker spaces were selected, the DIT design studio and Robotech studio as the main production hubs.-d) Online adverts were made and circulated on social media.-e) Orders were placed by frontline health workers or a hospital by using a USSD code — Text VIFAA to 15062, feedback is given through SMS after receipt.-f) A crowd funding platform established by UNDP acc lab partner Bits&Bytes manages order and uses the fund to absorb the bills incurred by Public hospitals where there was need.-g) PPEs developed include; intubation box, face shields (costing about $2, whereas imported ones sell for up to $11 a piece) including ventilator parts- all these parts are tested by the National Hospital labs before mass production, distribution and delivery.-h) The partners involved in the community host a weekly zoom call and a WhatsApp chat group for updates.-i) 3D printing machines used included; Ultimaker, Prusa and Forge Dreame.-Making a difference.-Incredibly, at the time of writing, this collaboration had led to designing, fabricating, and distribution of over 2000 units of various PPEs to support Tanzanian front line health workers in various public and private hospitals. The products included face shields, intubation boxes and ventilator splitters. it reached clinicians at Muhumbili National Hospital (The largest hospital in Tanzania), Amana Regional Referral Hospital, The Aga Khan Hospital and to others across regions such as Arusha and the Islands of Zanzibar.
-With support from UNDP, the Design Studio and other partners will be able to increase their capacity to respond to CoVID-19. This will include distribution of thousands more PPEs, ventilator parts and other medical device spare parts and local sterilization solutions. At the time of writing, UNDP accelerator lab Tanzania is also intending to formalize knowledge partnership with multiple actors in the ‘makers community’.-In his words, Dr. Binagi the head of COVID-19 response facility at Amana hospital in Dar Es Salaam, pointed out;-‘we are so thankful to UNDP and its partners for this timely support, we have 90 nurses and doctors on shift and therefore PPEs are highly needed in our hospital in order to protect them, we kindly ask you to scale up your work and support more public hospitals across the country’- -And takeaways.
-As per the Swahili proverb above, COVID -19 pandemic has challenged and tested us a great deal, it has however brought forward a big opportunity for creativity and invention within and outside hubs, maker spaces and development actors in general to experiment and test what  really works at a time like this . It is also crucial also for innovators to start thinking how they can take 3D printing and other innovations to scale but also on the relevance of their post -COVID interventions.
-As we embark on this journey, I still think about Sub-Saharan Africa which is still grappling to enhance its economies with the facets of the 2nd Industrial revolution such as electrification. 3D printing is a fourth Industrial revolution technology- obviously not an easy song to sing! But I guess, this and many other initiatives in Africa will demonstrate how small moves like this one can have such as an amplified effect on people’s lives.-As I end this narrative, you may probably ask, so, what next? I have a few ideas;-1) Development actors need to ensure that these learning/experiences in turn inform policy and programmes across sectors-2)It is crucial to support Innovative businesses to become ‘bankable’ and get them for scaling/growing-3) Instigating discussion on how governments can embrace 4IR technologies and finally, the innovation ecosystem as a whole need to address issues of inclusion and in this case bridging the urban-rural technological divide.-What have you learnt from your experience? I am happy to hear from you, let’s keep the debate going. Finally, I call on the private sector, donors, innovators and philanthropists to join us and support this life saving initiative In Tanzania.-‘Writing this blog gave me a huge sense of hope and anticipation, if you feel the same feel free to share with your colleagues and friends’

Not only were her twins conjoined, but they were under-weight and suffering from malnutrition. Helen wasn’t aware that her children could be separated, until a health specialist advised her to visit Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala. At first, she feared losing her children in the process, but with support from counsellors at the hospital she began to trust doctors at Mulago Hospital to commence the procedure.-Dr. John Sekabira, Pediatric Surgery Director at Mulago Hospital, concluded that the procedure would be possible but given the poor nutritional status of the children they would first need to undergo a nutritional plan to gain sufficient weight and improve health markers, in turn improving the likelihood of a successful procedure.-Dr. Sekabira worked with Dr. Esther Babirekere, Head of Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit at Mulago Hospital, who prescribed the children a special diet called Ekitoobero: a special mixture of various nutrient-rich foods, prepared under specific conditions to optimize nutrient retention. Preparing this meal was previously very time-consuming and inefficient while the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit was using firewood as cooking fuel. Though, now that the kitchens have been fully converted to electricity via the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Electricity Regulatory Authority’s (ERA) Biomass to Electricity project, such special meals can be easily prepared.- -“We have been able to feed the babies to the right weight with high quality nutritional food value, because we now have a fully equipped electric kitchen,” said Dr. Esther Babirekere. “Since the conversion, the chefs no longer spend hours preparing food and suffering respiratory complications due to smoke from the burning firewood. Also, all children in this ward are now getting their food on time.”-In 2019, the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab team ran a call for solutions for combatting deforestation throughout the country. ERA responded with the solution of converting large institutions’ kitchens from cooking with biomass (organic matter such as charcoal and food fuel) to instead using electricity, what would become the Biomass to Electricity project. The main premise of this experiment was to inform the possibility of reducing the national electricity tariff rate and encourage large institutions such as hospitals, schools and prisons to make the switch to electricity. As the Accelerator Lab team reflects on the journey of this experiment, it has been interesting to note how other unique results have emerged.-The Experiment-Before conversion to electricity, the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit would use on average 96.5 kg of firewood to prepare meals for around 100 people daily. Firewood would be delivered using a truck that carried on average 1.65 tons of wood, costing an average of 700,000 UGX ($200 USD) per delivery. The Biomass to Electricity project design hypothesized that as electricity is made affordable compared to alternative energy sources - in an environment with relevant enabling policies and awareness on electric cooking - then households and institutions would be motivated to adopt electricity as the primary source of energy for cooking, thereby reducing carbon emissions and the impacts of deforestation.-The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) has since made amendments to the existing electricity tariff structure applicable to customers served by Umeme Limited (Uganda’s main electricity distribution company) and approved a preferential tariff of 451.4 UGX/kWh for this project. Upon approval of the preferential tariff and full conversion of the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit kitchens to electricity, the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab team understands that the Mulago Hospital administration will likely re-allocate the budget for firewood to instead cover the costs of electricity for cooking.- -Political Commissioning of the fully converted Kitchen-During the recent launch of the Biomass to Electricity project, Minister for Energy and Mineral Development Hon. Dr. Ruth Nankabirwa explained that given the Government of Uganda’s frustration by the tremendous negative impacts of using biomass for cooking - from the depletion of forests to health challenges such as respiratory complications – the Government has decided to reform the electricity sub-sector. She noted that Uganda currently enjoys sufficient electricity generation which can effectively meet the energy needs of its population for industrial, commercial and domestic purposes, adding that “Therefore, shifting focus to accelerated access to electricity, increased affordability and reliable electricity supply is a step in the right direction.”-Meanwhile, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Ms. Sheila Ngatia noted that Uganda has lost 122,000 hectares of forest on average every year from 1990-2015, with demand for charcoal especially from institutions and homesteads being among the leading factors for reduction of forest cover. With this alarming statistic, she emphasized the need to work together with Government to reverse the situation if the country is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).-ERA Chief Executive Officer Ms. Ziria Tibalwa Waako revealed that, following learnings from this experiment, ERA plans to convert 50,000 households and 500 institutions from using biomass as the primary source of energy for cooking/heating to instead using electricity. “There could be fears of high electricity tariffs and unreliable power supply,” she said. “At ERA, we have designed a special tariff of 451.4 UGX per kilowatt-hour for institutions and 412 UGX per kilowatt-hour for domestic consumers under this project. We are also looking at further lowering the tariffs as the consumption of electricity grows.”-As we continue to study the possibility of further reducing electricity tariffs to encourage Ugandans to adopt electricity as the preferred energy for cooking, the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab team is so far delighted that the experiment is already having an impact. The sparkle in the eyes of Ms. Helen Kugonza, whose conjoined twin babies were successfully separated and are now happy and healthy, makes us proud and we pat ourselves on the back with a collective sigh of delight.- -By Hadijah Nabbale, Head of Solutions Mapping.","['Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Ethnography,Goal 15  Life on land,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Design Thinking,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Solutions Mapping,Sensemaking,Goal 13  Climate action,System Thinking,Newsletter,English,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The COVID-19 pandemic put a strain on market and production in the development minerals sector which has led to livelihood loss, increased health risks during mining, as well as exclusion of socially vulnerable groups such as women and youth.  -Kirabo Mackline Nalongo is a woman leader and secretary of Kabingo Central People with Disabilities Association in Kabingo subcounty, Isingiro District, Western Uganda. She works together with a team of 20 members stone quarrying in the rocky hilly areas of Kabingo subcounty.-To address constraints faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme an initiative of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, financed by the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and implemented by UNDP provides small grants to support associations, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders in the development minerals sector. 12 grantees in Uganda were selected for award of small grants and before commencing implementation, the 12 grantees were oriented on principles of UNDP project management and communication guidelines.-We spoke to Kirabo to learn about how the small grants programme has helped her association and its members improve their income, production, health, and safety.-“Previously our income was very low and all the money we got was spent on daily feeding of our families,” said Kirabo. But thanks to UNDP and other partners for this small grant, now we earn some extra money which has enabled us to save and venture into other projects like piggery and tailoring. We were also given face masks and have a washing area to guard against COVID-19. Similarly, we were also supplied with protective gear to provide safety against injuries at work.”-Growing up, Kirabo recalls how people with disability had always been ignored in her society. She explains that most of the time she was considered useless and a burden to society.  Being the most visible and easiest option to pursue, she opted to start a stone quarrying business with the intention of proving doubters wrong that disability does not have to mean inability.-“The people with disability have previously been ignored,” she said. “But now they are well known, and people are appreciating their services.”
- -The Association was established in 2018 and was officially registered in May 2021, made up of 20 persons with disability out of which 15 are women, the objective of the association is to achieve financial sustainability. In furtherance of this objective, the association started a stone quarry, piggery and later tailoring business with all profits re-invested.-UNDP held a meeting with group members who appreciated the support given, noting that the community has benefited through job creation in the mining sites of Kabingo county.-The Chairman of the association disclosed that when one member lost an eye at the quarry from a flying stone, the association sought to mechanize its operations to prevent further injuries on site. They therefore started using a stone crusher machine. While at first this proposition seemed expensive and daunting, UNDP support has made this dream become a reality. They have designed a protype stone crusher machine which they intend to fabricate. Meanwhile, there has been progress on the implementation of the grant activities in respect of research and design for the prototype, as well as procurement of necessary materials.-The first phase of this initiative has covered three northern region grantees based in the districts of Nebbi, Lira and Gulu, while the second phase covers five grantees based in the Western and Central regions which are in the districts of Isingiro, Ibanda, Hoima, Bushenyi and Wakiso.-The 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent the United Nations’ plan of action for social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic development. It is our shared belief that the mining industry has an unprecedented opportunity to mobilize human, physical, technological, and financial resources to advance the SDGs and to achieve Uganda’s development aspirations.-Mining is a global industry and is often located in remote ecologically sensitive and less developed areas that include many indigenous lands and territories. When managed appropriately it can create jobs, spur innovation, and bring investment and infrastructure at a game-changing scale. Yet if managed poorly, mining can also lead to environmental degradation, displaced populations, inequality and increased conflict, among other challenges.-The Development Minerals sector is dominated by socio-economically disadvantaged artisanal miners of small and medium business actors who experienced unprecedented business disruptions and shocks because of the COVID 19 Pandemic. The stringent lockdown measures by Government of Uganda to stem the transmission of the virus inevitably resulted into abandonment of the quarrying sites, loss of jobs and business opportunities. COVID19 put a strain on Market and production in the Quarrying activities thus leading to livelihood loss, increased health risks during mining as well as exclusion of socially vulnerable groups such as women and youth from related supply and value chains in the sector.  - -UNDP selected Twelve (12) grantees for the award of small grants, and all had received funds by end of September 2021. The grantees were grouped into associations namely, Environmental Women in Action for Development (EWAD), Mid-Western Region Anti-Corruption Coalition (MIRAC), Ibanda Community Based Artisanal Miners (ICBAM), Kabingo Central PWDs Association, and Buhimba Quarry Association. Before commencing implementation, the 12 grantees were oriented about UNDP project management and communication guidelines. Through UNDP’s ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will continue to be supported to thrive in this sector and improve the livelihoods of those who are most vulnerable.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Uganda,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 5  Gender equality,Newsletter,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The initiative is implemented by the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Water and Environment’s Climate Change Department (MWE/CCD), with funding from the European Union and the governments of Germany and Spain as a contribution to the NDC Partnership.-The NDC Support Programme has established climate change mitigation and adaptation action grants with the aim to engage women and youth-led organizations to implement initiatives that contribute to the implementation of Uganda’s NDC. The climate action grants focus on innovative technology solutions with high impact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contribute to NDC implementation and sustainable development, and enterprises that have substantial impact through innovation, replication, and sustainability.-The support provided through these climate action grants has created financial incentives for organizations to implement climate change mitigation technologies and contribute to climate action and NDC implementation. This is happening through boosted growth and competitiveness by empowering women and youth to adopt low carbon technologies and innovations; fostering participation of women and youth in the implementation of climate mitigation; and supporting implementation of innovative low-carbon technologies by increasing access to renewable energy services at the grassroot level.- -Grants provided are in the range of $8,000-10,000 USD per project, with each project having been implemented within one year from receipt of the grant. The NDC Support Programme has supported a total of 12 projects within districts that contribute to NDC implementation in key sectors including Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Waste Management, Climate Smart Agriculture, Forestry, Water Resource Management, Wetlands and Infrastructure.  The 12 organizations supported include Yo-Waste, Uganda Muslim Development Rural Development Association (UMURDA), Bubukanza Youth Development Farmers Group, Centre for Climate and Ecosystems for Social Innovations (CLESI), Ngenge Development Foundation (NDF), Kangai Integrated Community Development Initiative (KICD), Community Empowerment and Rehabilitation for Development (CERID), Jane Kidi Memorial tree planting project, Youth Initiative for Community Empowerment (YICE), Friends of Nature, Kataara Women’s Poverty Alleviation group, and Living Earth.- -The prioritized organizations are implementing innovative projects contributing to addressing the impacts of climate change, foster participation of women and youth in implementation and reach vulnerable groups of people and stakeholders that would not normally be involved in more centralized project activities.-Tukole Hamwe Group is one of the womens’ groups supported by Living Earth, noting that the project has empowered women in the area.  The womens’ group noted that the training received in the manufacture of briquettes has enabled them to do business through the sale of briquettes which has increased their household income. Women noted they can buy basic household needs and pay school fees for the children. In addition, they can save money instead of buying charcoal and firewood for cooking. Briquettes are a clean biomass technology that reduce dependence on charcoal and firewood and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.- -Through Jane Kidi memorial tree planting project, 8,000 trees have also been planted in West Nile region of Uganda in Nebbi district. In addition, the project has supported restoration of Jupangira catchment area through tree planting. The project has promoted community nursery tree establishment and improved the skills of community members on tree growing and management through training. - -The supported organizations have also promoted access to renewable energy technologies including solar for women groups, energy efficient cookstoves, biogas and briquettes in rural areas and 50 women groups have accessed energy efficient cook stoves which has reduced the number of hours women take while fetching firewood. In addition, through promoting climate smart agriculture practices, support has been provided to members of 15 cooperatives to establish up to 50 hectares of agro-forestry plantations, many of which are multi-purpose usage and will contribute to both access to wood fuel and reduction of greenhouse gas emission through carbon sequestration.-The NDC Support Programme aims to support the Government of Uganda achieve transformational change by scaling up public and private investments in climate change actions for sustainable low carbon development. This project is implemented by the Ministry of Water and Environment, Climate Change Department, with funding from the European Union and the Governments of Germany and Spain as a contribution to the NDC Partnership. - -By Gloria Namande, Project Manager, NDC Support Programme

Following a nationwide call in which over 4,000 young Ugandans registered business ideas in sectors of Agriculture, Health, Tourism, Manufacturing, Minerals, Creative Arts and ICT, the Top 100 Finalists were selected to participate in the Youth IDEAthon Bootcamp, an intensive week of mentorship, business workshops and pitching sessions to nurture their business ideas.-The Accelerator Lab team noticed some interesting trends when engaging with participants at the Youth IDEAthon Bootcamp. One of the more encouraging trends being that a handful of the Top 100 Finalists were young mothers, juggling their baby in one arm and their entrepreneurial aspirations in the other.-Miriam Feeza, 24 years old, is a refugee who fled Democratic Republic of the Congo due to political instability. She now resides in Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Western Uganda where she was introduced to the world of entrepreneurship through the Social Innovation Academy (SINA). Through support from SINA, Miriam benefitted from internet access to submit her Youth IDEAthon business idea of Clay Cosmo, a natural skincare product. At the time of applying, Miriam was expecting the birth of her son. At the time of the Youth IDEAthon Bootcamp, Miriam and her son were in attendance together.-“I’m thankful for this programme,” said Miriam. “To include women, though we have responsibilities with us, we are included in such opportunities to show our potential and to inspire other women.”-“We don’t have to create excuses. I’m having a baby, I’m having this responsibility, but there are a lot of opportunities here that are there to include us. We need to bring out all those things that we are passionate about and go to fulfil them.”-Watch a short interview with Miriam Feeza.- -Atwine Scovia, 23 years old, resides in Kabale in Western Uganda and is a first-class graduate in Bachelor of Science from Makerere University. Following her pregnancy, Scovia feared that her career opportunities would suffer, until she learned of the Youth IDEAthon through her local FM radio station. Her business idea, a health drink derived from the Prunus Africana tree, is advocating for this tree species to be cultivated widely, not only for its potential health benefits but also to spur environmental conservation.-“Having a baby should not be a limitation,” said Atwine. “In case of any opportunity, I would call upon anyone to apply and don’t take it for granted.”-“I would advise young mothers, wherever they are, to take up opportunities. Even during these hard times of COVID, they can still make it. It shouldn’t be a limitation for their success”.-Watch a short interview with Atwine Scovia.- -Through the Youth IDEAthon Bootcamp, in which the Top 100 Finalists were selected to pitch their business ideas to a panel of judges, both Miriam Feeza and Atwine Scovia were selected among the Top 30 to receive additional support from UNDP and NASE Africa. They were both selected based on a rigorous judging criterion that assessed their pitch, business model, and the impact of their idea in terms of job creation and contribution to achievement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).-Lessons from the Youth IDEAthon-1.       With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting initial Youth IDEAthon engagement plans, including physical visits to rural areas of Uganda, NASE Africa and the UNDP Accelerator Lab decided to move all activities online. This had an adverse effect on some potential applicants, especially those who were unable to access Youth IDEAthon Zoom sessions or the online application portal due to limited internet coverage.-2.       Contrary to existing entrepreneurship literature which suggests that Ugandan women are more entrepreneurial than men, the Accelerator Lab and NASE Africa teams were puzzled by the gender disparity in applications, with applications from men accounting for 73% of total applications. As the NASE Africa team were tracking weekly registration trends, we were able to recruit more female influencers as a means of encouraging greater female participation. This measure did help raise the number of women applying. We are conscious that limited access to information, digital devices and internet connections remain structural barriers to women in Uganda in boosting their entrepreneurship capacities and abilities.-3.       People with disabilities were not adequately supported during the original Youth IDEAthon planning phase. As soon as this was brought to our attention, the team quickly pivoted and arranged additional support for people with disabilities, such as sign language services. Certain groups of vulnerable populations can easily be left out of development initiatives, unless specific targeting is undertaken to ensure no one is left behind. In future, UNDP and partners will adequately prepare tailored services for people with disabilities to ensure vulnerable groups can participate in the fullest capacity.-4.       The Youth IDEAthon attracted a number of applications from Ugandan participants living in Burundi, Zambia, South Sudan, DRC, UK and USA. We believe this to be a good opportunity to plan for Ugandans living in the diaspora through sharing the Youth IDEAthon exploits with other UNDP Country Offices.-5.       When assessing applications by sector, Agriculture (29%) led the way, but we found it difficult to attract ideas from Urban Development (5%), Tourism (3%), and Mining and Renewable Energy (2%). This was despite employing tourism influencers as a strategy to attract additional application in this sector.- -Given the current rate of youth unemployment in Uganda, now exacerbated by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to learn from these lessons and continue to devise strategies to help nurture the creativity of Uganda’s youth. Being intentional when encouraging vulnerable groups such as women, youth and people with disabilities is a crucial part of the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab team’s strategy to ensure that no one is left behind, as we continue to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship among the youth of Uganda.- -By Hadijah Nabbale, Head of Solutions Mapping and Ashley Prigent, Communications Specialist.

During the summit, it was agreed that short-term or emergency support from a single actor can only achieve limited stability in the humanitarian sector and cannot pursue the ultimate recovery, resilience or development outcomes. The Humanitarian-Development-Peace (HDP) Nexus was thus established with the belief that no single actor can fully deliver the required response.-As such, many humanitarian actors, implementing organizations and donor institutions have proactively adopted the HDP Nexus framework. As the leading development agency among the United Nations family, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is committed to advancing human development, create opportunities for empowerment, support nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet and improve the quality of life for all citizens.-The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), the Republic of Korea’s international aid organization, has also endorsed the HDP Nexus framework in humanitarian support and prioritized it to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.-It is under this backdrop that UNDP and KOICA have designed and implemented the “Uganda Host and Refugee Community Empowerment” project in three districts of Lamwo, Adjumani and Obongi in Northern Uganda. The project was designed against the HDP Nexus framework and adopted UNDP’s 3x6 approach, an innovative UNDP programme approach promoting sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable and crisis-affected groups, such as those affected by disasters or conflict. The approach is based on traditional components of employment generation and livelihoods promotion, including a) Generating immediate income; b) Injecting capital into the local economy; and c) Providing opportunities for diversified livelihoods.-Development challenges being addressed
-From the project designing phase, key stakeholders were engaged to identify existing gaps and challenges to address in the region, plan for long-term community empowerment, and maintain close partnerships during implementation. As a result, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and trauma issues were identified as critical areas to address to achieve community livelihood empowerment. Environmental degradation was another key challenge in the region, with many community members cutting down trees to source firewood.-As the project entered its third year of implementation, outcomes became visible. UNDP’s intervention conveyed long-term livelihood changes of the target communities by connecting short to mid-term inputs made by various players and adding integrated responses to the crisis. Behavioral and mindset changes were observed at all corners of the project including beneficiaries, community leaders, local government leaders, and implementing partners during a recent UNDP-KOICA joint monitoring visit in November 2021. - -Hellen’s Story: A holistic approach to strengthen economic resilience-Hellen Ayany is a South Sudanese Refugee who fled to Uganda in 2017 during the war in South Sudan. She is 40 years old and has four children along with two more dependents living in Palabek Settlement in Lamwo. Hellen’s story of resilience began in 2017 when she lost all her property, was separated from her husband during the war, and has been left as the sole caregiver for six dependents.-After arriving in Uganda, Hellen tried to sustain a life for her family, though it wasn’t easy. As the UNDP-KOICA project was initiated, Hellen could find more income opportunities than before. She has participated in the Cash-for-Work community road opening activity and saved the income by joining Village Saving and Loans Associations (VSLAs). She also opened a small retail shop with the capital of 500,000 Ugandan shillings ($141 USD) and was also selected as a small start-up business grantee, receiving an additional 430,000 shillings to boost her retail business. -However, even with all the support received, Hellen was often not motivated to go to the shop. Trauma from the war in South Sudan has limited her ability to work.-The psycho-social support and trauma healing session are the key components of the project and have trained community facilitators and others. The chairwoman of VSLA, who was trained in Problem Management Plus (PM+), a World Health Organization (WHO) trans-diagnostic psychological intervention, recognized Hellen’s condition and engaged her in the trauma healing sessions. Hellen shared her experience of how psychosocial support helped her achieve economic improvement.-“I learned that I can speak out and share my problems with friends and neighbors I can trust. That’s the first step of problem-solving,” said Hellen. “Once I share my thoughts and memories from the past, the heavy feeling pressuring my chest is lifted. The more I share, the more I feel light. When I feel down or have household problems, I go to the chairwoman or neighbors. If I am so down and can’t visit somebody, they come to me, checking on me. This psychosocial support helped me to be motivated and maintain my life well. My kids are happier than ever. They see me as active and learning. They are even doing better in school.”- -Local Government invested in community livelihoods-Adjumani District hosts the highest number of refugee settlements (18) in Uganda and Ukusijoni is one of the refugee-hosting sub-counties in the district. The sub-county was selected as the UNDP-KOICA project site, and sub-county officials have been working closely together with the project implementation partner, World Vision, and UNDP. Being part of the project and going through project planning and implementation together with UNDP, World Vision, and KOICA was a total learning process. The sub-county officials were able to connect with various development partners and district officials, properly assess the needs, gaps and opportunities in the communities, and reflect them within development plans of the sub-county. - -Testimonies from community leaders-The Sub-County Chairman, Mr. Arambe Dominic, testified that the community access road opening made the most substantial impact. Road accessibility is crucial for the quality of the community’s livelihood. The accessibility to the community facilities, such as health facilities, schools, food distribution points, and others can be improved with just a 500 meter road. However, opening the new road requires hard labor, and people are reluctant to participate in such activities, which makes it difficult even for humanitarian actors to mobilize participants. For this reason, most humanitarian partners focused on road condition improvement. 
- -“In 2020, UNDP came and linked the road opening as one of the Cash-for-Work activities,” said the Sub-Country Chairman. “Since the participants will have guaranteed cash income, community people were willing to participate in the road opening work. A 1.2km community access road was opened and connects Kiraba village people to Ukusijoni Health Center III, the sub-county office, and other strategic community points. Also, it connects the Kiraba community people with the Maaji II refugee settlement.”-“The increased interaction between host and refugee communities helped boost the economic trades and generate household income. After witnessing the life-changing experience, we plan ourselves where the next roads will be opened and how to mobilize and allocate the budget. We also share this experience with other peer officials and partners. Once the roads are manually opened, the other partners with compaction machines, such as UNHCR, come and widen the road. It’s a collective action.”-The Sub-County Chairman added that the Kiraba road (1.2km) has earned Ukusijoni a youth resource which will be constructed by Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development (USMID) under Ministry of Land, Housing, and Urban Development, with funding from the World Bank. USMID has been conducting the construction feasibility study in Adjumani. The sub-county officials strongly addressed the improved accessibility via the Kiraba road and upcoming road work plans, which convinced and attracted the investment.-“The community people are pleased with all the progress achieved, and the strong trust that has been established between the local government and the communities. We will do our best to keep up this momentum. As we closely connected with the other partners via this project, we shall be keen to find and bring the resources to our sub-county. We now know where the gaps are, where to improve, and what to do.”-By Sooyoung Choi, Project Coordination and Liaison Officer, UNDP

The system is accessible to government bodies, the private sector and other key stakeholders in the forestry and environmental sectors, serving to forecast future trends in forest cover, generate support for prevention and mitigation of deforestation, and provide credible data to influence decision-making on resource mobilization and land allocation relating to activities conducted in Uganda’s forests. -NARIS can be used both online and offline, consisting of desktop and mobile applications for use in office and field locations. The system incorporates a web user interface incorporating a geographic information system (GIS) with a landcover map of Uganda as a baseline, a mobile application to assist with field monitoring and validating information gathered from satellite imagery, the capability to track changes in forest cover over time and validate field actions through the mobile interface, and the capability to sync offline data once the user has returned online.-NARIS forms part of a portfolio of experiments that the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab curated to curb rates of deforestation in Uganda. This journey began with making sense of the problem of deforestation in the country, threatening depletion of forests by the year 2040, impacting climate change, the tourism sector, and the entire natural ecosystem. In understanding this, the Accelerator Lab team used collective intelligence by gathering key stakeholders in one room, including the unusual partners such as illegal loggers, charcoal sellers, heads of large institutions that consume a significant amount of biomass, and policy makers. 
-From this engagement, we discovered several issues that contribute to deforestation and depletion of forests including lack of proper source of livelihood, limited efficient alternative cooking energy solutions, and a lack of appropriate data to inform interventions. This is what informed the portfolio of experiments that the Accelerator Lab team is currently running, including a pilot of transforming Mulago Hospital Kitchens from using biomass to electricity, an energy audit to assess clean cooking solutions that can be used as alternatives to charcoal and firewood in large institutions, and the NARIS platform.-With the NARIS platform now launched, we are already planning on scaling it to not only monitor forests, but also to strengthen natural resources governance thanks to the generosity of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) through the UNDP Anti-Corruption for Peaceful and Inclusive Societies (ACPIS) Global Programme.
-NFA Executive Director Mr. Tom Okello was optimistic regarding the potential of NARIS to impact the day-to-day work of his team. “The Uganda Natural Resource Information System (NARIS) is very timely as it will not only help our field team to get real-time data on the state of forests, but it can also be used to monitor other parameters like people movements and their activities,” he said. “I call upon my staff to embrace this innovative and modern forestry management tool for efficient delivery of duties in these modern times. On behalf of NFA, I would like to thank UNDP for supporting the development of this tool.”
-UNDP Resident Representative Ms. Elsie Attafuah also emphasized the broad scope of impact and influence of NARIS. “Uganda’s environmental, economic and social wellbeing are tightly bound to the benefits that healthy forests provide,” she said. “Deforestation has the potential to threaten this fine balance through exacerbating climate change and reducing biodiversity, and if deforestation is not addressed the impacts have potential to stall or even reverse Uganda’s development trajectory.”-“The Uganda Natural Resource Information System (NARIS) has great potential to forecast trends in forest cover, trigger real-time response, and generate strategic and coordinated support to protect Uganda’s forests for years to come.”-The UNDP Uganda Accelerator lab is excited to witness how scaling of the NARIS platform will eventuate, as it has already brought on board new partners such as the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), National Information Technology Authority (NITA-U) and Civil Society Organizations.-To learn more about the Uganda Natural Resource Information System (NARIS), you can watch the-NARIS Documentary here.- -By Hadijah Nabbale, Head of Solutions Mapping and Ashley Prigent, Communications Specialist.",['Icon of SDG 13'],"Goal 13  Climate action,Uganda,Solutions Mapping,Blog post,English,Accelerator Labs"

From over 200 solutions, one particular submission sparked the interest of our team. That submission came from the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA).- -As of October 2020, Uganda was generating 1,023.59 MW of hydro power. This hydro power is constantly being extended to different districts of Uganda and offers more than enough in terms of energy consumption for the country. Despite this, most Ugandans still use biomass (organic matter used as fuel) for most of their cooking needs, contributing greatly to the glaring problem of deforestation. This is partly contributed to by a stiff tariff making cooking with electricity an expensive venture. It is against under this backdrop that ERA applied to test electric cooking using the most appropriate tariff to encourage its use in high biomass consumption institutions like schools, hospitals and prisons.- -Together with ERA, we decided to co-experiment and dive deeper, starting with Mulago National Referral Hospital. The hospital’s main kitchen and the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit kitchen were to be fully converted to electric kitchens with an approved lowered tariff by the ERA board to aid the initial testing.- -Walking into the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit kitchen to understand what was currently being used for cooking, the Accelerator Lab team found ourselves coughing and struggling to breathe due to the excessive smoke from burning firewood. Reflecting on our experience as we left the hospital, we could not help but wonder how those working in the kitchen, preparing nutritious meals to nourish children back to health, worked in this type of environment each and every day. On top of the smoke challenge, staff would often find that firewood was not dry enough, leading to delays in preparation and delivery of meals.-“We mainly use firewood and using firewood has many challenges,” explains Dr. Esther Babirekere, Paediatrician at Mulago Hospital. “Lighting these stoves can be a difficult task and firewood can generate a lot of smoke which is not healthy. We are preparing many meals each day and it can be a difficult task for our staff, so an alternative approach would make things easier.”-A reconstruction of the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit kitchen was proposed, with the new design aiming to give staff a cleaner a more efficient space to work and serve. Electrical connections are ongoing to isolate the two kitchens from the main supply of the hospital and have them each on separate meters. This will aid in having a clear picture of electric consumption in the independent kitchens. In addition, baseline measurement and observation studies are being conducted to give a comparative picture. Meanwhile, to ensure continuity of service, we relocated staff to a temporary kitchen as construction and installation goes on in their kitchen.- -Despite ongoing restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the teams have managed to proceed with the reconstruction and civil electrical and mechanical works of the redesign for the kitchen, which are nearing completion. As we conclude the construction and baseline studies, we have been thrilled to learn some key lessons.-Unintended positive impacts: While we set out to pilot test electric cooking in the hospitals, the administration enlightened us on the several impacts and the lives this project could potentially change. The primary source of treatment in the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit of the hospital is nourishment back to health of malnourished children. The hospital stays of these children are usually very long. With conversion to electric cooking, the hope is that food will be prepared in a timely fashion and in turn hospital stays may be reduced.
-Partnership the key to success: With COVID-19 restricting movement, it was possible that we may have needed to pivot our approach. However, co-experimenting with ERA and the Mulago Hospital team has enabled us to see progress during this period from getting special permissions to carry out this work with standard operating procedures in place. The partnering teams have also been key in providing technical guidance on the initiative.
-In the coming weeks, the team is looking forward to receiving additional equipment, complete construction works, and proceed with monitoring and evaluation processes that will be critical to this experiment. We look forward to positive results and many more key learnings, as UNDP and ERA continue to work together to promote alternative sources of energy, reduce the use of biomass, and in turn ease the impact of deforestation in Uganda.- -By Kathy Ndieli, Accelerator Lab Intern; Hadijah Nabbale, Head of Solutions Mapping; Deborah Naatujuna, Head of Exploration; and Berna Mugema, Head of Experimentation.

What’s more, in the next 20 years the world’s population is projected to increase by a further 2 billion. On 12 August 2021 we celebrate International Youth Day under the theme of Transforming Food Systems: Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health. Through this blog I hope to highlight how the youth of Uganda are working in line with this theme, how several economic activities impact the food chain from the farm to the market, and how this has provided a wider field for youth to be involved in agriculture and food systems, either directly or indirectly.-When I was growing up, agriculture was strictly farm to table. Elders spent whole days on the farm while the little ones spent just a few minutes in the market. There is little wonder that when asked where milk comes from, my younger self would proud respond with “the supermarket”. There was clearly a disconnect in my knowledge somewhere between the farm and the table.-Schools are the birthplace of knowledge in our society. While at school, students can gain practical knowledge relating to agriculture through clubs such as Young Farmers and the Entrepreneurship Club, as well as through activities such as field trips and gardening. With schools being closed due to COVID-19 precautions, youth have since had to avail themselves with tutorials, webinars and online information relating to agriculture from their homes.-Youth are major drivers of innovation when it comes to transforming food systems in Uganda. Characterised by smaller family structures and living arrangements, today’s youth have normalized urban farming, clearing the stereotype that agriculture requires large plots of land somewhere in the village. On top of that, this has provided children at home with a safe space to practice what they learn at school.-Youth today are also contributing to ever-changing and transforming food systems in Uganda, an innovation space where we are seeing farms connected with markets through e-commerce, farmers being equipped with improved skills and technologies, perishable foods such as matooke being preserved and supplied year-round, as well as a downward trend in the use of charcoal for cooking. These, along with many other transformative innovations within Uganda’s food systems, are sure to have a positive impact on human and planetary health for years to come.-Though, while youth have brilliant ideas to bring to the table, the fear is that they are not always sustainable. This is due to a multitude of challenges including available capital and mentorship to drive innovation and entrepreneurship. Today’s youth are a generation that may have easy access to information, though they still require guidance on how to apply their newly acquired knowledge.- -The National Association of Student Enterprises (NASE) seeks to bridge this gap by connecting youth with mentors, providing grants to young entrepreneurs, and allowing budding ideas to flourish through innovation hubs. Through the Youth IDEAthon, an initiative supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), NASE has created a platform for youth to access various sectors of the economy to enliven their ideas. The initiative is creating and supporting sustainable approaches to the most pressing development challenges, and the Youth IDEAthon has so far attracted over 4,800 ideas from youth competing for seed funding, incubation support and one-to-one mentorship from all corners of the country.-Speaking of mentorship, NASE also encourages youth innovation within its own office by occasionally offering youth internships to support on various projects. This approach helps to complement the youth’s formal education with soft skills including leadership, problem solving, teamwork, creativity, communications and negotiation, to mention but a few. This is how I ended up working with the NASE team on the Youth IDEAthon, which has turned out to be the most enjoyable and fulfilling project I have every worked on. I have learned a lot in the process, made many friends and established some lifelong connections.-As we celebrate International Youth Day this year, my rallying call to my fellow youth is to seek out and have an open mind to opportunities such as the Youth IDEAthon. Once given the opportunity, apply yourself, and keep an open mind to learning.- -By Elizabeth Atamba, S6 Vacist and NASE Intern.-The Youth IDEAthon is an initiative led by NASE and supported by the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab presenting entry level opportunities to unearth and nurture creative early-stage and startup ideas that can eventually feed into the pipeline of the UNDP Youth4Business Innovation and Entrepreneurship Facility. This initiative is intended to form the next generation of transformative, innovative and inclusive micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). In addition, the initiative provides youth with an interactive and collaborative process to develop and refine their ideas for products, services and solutions that help Uganda respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.-To learn more about UNDP’s youth initiatives, visit UNDP Initiatives for Youth in Uganda.-To learn more about the work of NASE and the Youth IDEAthon, visit NASE.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Goal 4  Quality education,Uganda,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 14  Life below water,Newsletter,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,English,Accelerator Labs"

Though, scaling these solutions is not easy, for organizations to succeed in an increasingly competitive digital economy, they must be capable of scaling-up an idea to a viable product or service. To achieve this, organizations must overcome hurdles such as lack of knowledge and inefficiencies in the surrounding ecosystem such as access to finance, human capital, supportive policies and regulation and limited cultural understanding.-The UNDP Digital X Scale Accelerator, supported by the Government of Japan, is an initiative launched by UNDP’s Chief Digital Office to support Country Offices scale their respective innovations. The UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab is delighted to have been selected among the 10 teams to participate in the initiative, from 180 competitive applications. Ours is to scale the innovation of “Connecting informal micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to consumers through e-commerce”.-The Accelerator Lab team launched this initiative in 2020 when Uganda experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a means of keeping value chains active while the country was in total lockdown. Uganda is currently implementing a second national lockdown, challenging us to move our innovation from a prototype stage targeting markets in Kampala, to launching the initiative in other regions of the country. The Digital X team of experts, including Digital Innovation Consultant Mr. Christof Hawle, is set to walk us through this journey as we scale this initiative to cause transformational impact not only at national level but also in diverse geographical regions. By leveraging cutting edge digital technology, the goal for Digital X projects is to increase impact and create momentum toward achieving  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).-""This is a very exciting initiative,” says UNDP Digital Innovation Consultant, Mr. Christof Hawle. “If we can leverage the promising pilot results and the strong partnership with Jumia to crack the challenge of how to connect informal market vendors to e-commerce, the impact on the entire continent could be huge. We are still analysing the economics of the solution, but once we have gained full understanding, we may have a groundbreaking, scalable solution to bridge the digital divide in the space of e-commerce.""-It’s worth noting that this initiative is implemented in partnership with Jumia Uganda, which adapted the existing Jumia E-Commerce Platform to cater for a new market segment of vulnerable informal market vendors to sustain supply chains for food and other groceries.  This initiative is a strategic opportunity to empower vulnerable groups and those hardest hit in the informal trade sector such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities to connect them to niche markets.
- -From the early learning of the first phase of the experiment, we witnessed that there is a growing interest to join the Jumia E-Commerce Platform by the informal market vendors. In the first phase, we had over 3,000 unique vendors joining the e-commerce platform and doubling their weekly sales. The vendors were able to reach a larger customer base than they ordinarily would have reached through traditional markets.-We are using the lessons learnt from the start of this initiative to inform this scaling process. As we diffuse technology into informal businesses, we are learning that we must find ways to emulate the behaviors of a traditional market onto the E-Commerce Platform. We have also found that, for this model to work, it had to make financial or business sense for Jumia in terms of long-term sustainability.-“We have created an ecosystem and with UNDP we have been able to accelerate this ecosystem to reach more customers,” explains Jumia Uganda Country Manager, Mr. Timothy Mugume. “Within the next 6 to 12 months we have plans of expanding this programme whereby market vendors and most of the informal sector can be supported, and where customers are enabled to reach more vendors and more products throughout Uganda.”-The early insights paved a way for the second phase of the experiment and the Digital X Scale Accelerator funding and mentorship support is dedicated to this phase of the experiment.  This phase will pursue the following priority areas:-Re-designing the platform to cater for offline and low-income customers. We wish to explore avenues of making the platform more inclusive to cater for last mile consumers, the less technology savvy consumers and non-smart phone users while addressing their pain points and creating opportunities for them.-Expansion to new cities. This will include extending the e-commerce solution to new markets in Entebbe and Jinja where most of the potential customers are low-income customers.-Business and Digital Skills for Vendors and Market Agents. E-commerce in Uganda still experiences slow growth due to low digital skills of most citizens. This programme will empower market vendors and agents in a dynamic and convenient format realizing that the majority of vendors cannot leave their stalls to attend a training. We hope to model a skills-building package that imparts skills on vendors at the comfort of their stalls while strengthening the resilience of their businesses to economic shocks.-Sustainability of the model: We wish to unravel the quantitative dynamics of sustainability of the solution and derive future growth recommendations, with initial revenue model experiments to test the market models. This will include processing data from the markets to run parallel experiments with flexible commissions charged from different vendor engagement models, either individually or when they belong to a Savings and Credit Co-operatives (SACCO). In Uganda, SACCOs are community membership-based financial institutions formed and owned by their members to advance their economic interests.
- -As Uganda is still experiencing a significant digital divide in critical sectors such as education, health and agriculture, the potential for informal trade to move online is enormous. Integrating informal businesses into the e-commerce sector is one of the ways we can support business continuity for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), especially in the informal sector. -Aside from the four areas of the second phase, the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab team also maintains a focus on the bigger picture of supporting the development of the logistics and infrastructure of e-commerce as well as the policies and regulatory framework at a country level, to bridge the gap between local businesses, suppliers and markets across the country and spur trans-boundary trade.-Working together with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives (MTIC), the lessons from this initiative will inform policy on e-commerce with the end goal of providing an enabling environment for trade. We also hope to continue conversations collaboratively to work with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and other key actors to implement an e-commerce policy framework in Uganda. When we achieve these, we will have scaled successfully.- -By Deborah Naatujuna, Head of Exploration; Hadijah Nabbale, Head of Solutions Mapping; and Berna Mugema, Head of Experimentation.

While this may not be true, the perception continues to persist, especially among those who may not have the resources (knowledge, finances or time) to navigate through the system themselves.-This is particularly the case in refugee hosting districts such as Terego District, where justice services are often located far from where people live and where communities may feel they do not have the resources needed to pursue a case. Among refugees and host community members living in Rhino Camp in Terego, the formal justice system is perceived to be slow, geographically distant, ineffective and “unfair”.-As this attitude prevails, many legal cases, including criminal cases, are not brought to formal justice system institutions such as police, prosecutor or courts. This leads to a situation in which many cases of, for example, sexual and gender-based violence, go unreported. Perpetrators of crimes such as rape, sexual assault or defilement are often not held accountable for their actions.-UNDP, through the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, is committed to end impunity for crimes related to violence against women and children. It is therefore key that women, children and community members are equipped with the knowledge, confidence and resources to report these cases when they happen. -To make the Judiciary and other legal services more accessible and relatable to people in refugee and host communities, the Legal Aid Service Providers Network (LASPNET) was supported by the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative through UNDP to raise awareness among refugees and host communities in Terego district on access to justice and gender-based violence. Through a Legal Aid Open Day on 7 October 2020, LASPNET ensured that people were not only sensitized on the justice system in Uganda, but that community members were able to receive legal aid consultations if needed.- - -Emanuel Akullo was one of the 193 participants who attended the Open Day in Rhino Camp. Being a youth representative for his subcounty, he had been assisting LASPNET with mobilizing his community to attend. However, as he had never attended a Legal Aid Open Day before, he was not sure what to expect. Emanuel feared interaction with the courts – if he would be summoned as a witness to testify in court, he would not do it. He had heard that if you do, you will get in trouble yourself.-So, when he subsequently attended the event a few days later, he was positively surprised. A lot of people had showed up – not only people from his community but legal officers, lawyers, the Resident Judge of Arua, Hon. Justice Issa Sserunkuma, and other stakeholders. For the first time in his life, Emanuel could interact one-on-one with people working within the formal justice system. The stakeholders talked about where and how to interact with the Judiciary, legal aid service providers, and about how to report cases of sexual and gender-based violence.-Walking home from the Legal Aid Open Day, Emanuel realized that many of his preconceptions about the formal justice system were proven wrong. He had always thought that justice services were costly – now he knew that many services are free-of-charge and most processes are open to the public. Hearing other community members testifying that rape and defilement cases are high, and that survivors often are denied equitable justice, Emanuel also felt compelled to become a community advocate to help bring an end to gender-based violence.-Six months after the Legal Aid Open Day, Emanuel is now serving as a role model in his community by raising awareness about issues of violence against women and children. As he knows about how and where to report, he can help people who are not familiar with the justice system themselves. Before the Legal Aid Open Day, Emanuel had never set his foot in a courtroom - now he has attended several public hearings purely out of curiosity.-“I feel confident about processes and how to register a case now. I want to become a community advocate to help transform my community for the better, so that we can end gender-based violence,” says Emanuel. “The Legal Aid Open Day was truly an eyeopener for me.”-In 2021, the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative through UNDP and LASPNET will also support a Legal Aid Open Day in Kyegegwa District.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Blog post,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Newsletter"

A close friend advised me to join the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme as a way to expand my experience in medicine, while traveling and volunteering in service of others. My recollection of my sister’s illness made me decide right away that this was right for me.-When I was younger, my sister developed a medical condition. She underwent two heart surgical procedures and endured a lot of suffering, but she survived and inspired me. She later asked me to consider a career in medicine to help other young girls. When this volunteering opportunity came up, I took it and became a UN Volunteer on 27 March 2008.-I was recruited for the first volunteer assignment in Haiti. As a mother of a seven year-old twins, it was not easy for me to travel and leave them behind. But I did it with the support of my husband, who understood my motives and took good care of our children while I was deployed overseas.-I am sharing my experience to encourage other women, especially mothers, to not pass on such opportunities. I understand their role as caregivers. I hope learning about how I volunteered, and balanced between my work and family, will make them more confident that they can do it too.-While in Haiti, I practiced medicine amidst floods, cholera, earthquakes and a severe economic recession. These harsh conditions damaged roads and threatened the supply of food and other resources to affected communities.
-My volunteering journey with the UN took me next to support the Ebola response in Africa, amidst lockdowns and a profound public health crisis, which garnered the world's concern.-Through these emergency and disaster relief contexts, I became involved in inpatient and outpatient services, medical evacuations, capacity building, prevention and disease mitigation activities.-It was especially heartwarming to see my work being recognized while knowing I was making the contributions my sister always believed I would make. Serving with UNV prepared me in ways that I couldn't have imagined.-These experiences were wide-ranging and led my career growth within the UN. I eventually transitioned from a UN Volunteer Medical Officer to become the Health Manager of the UN Clinic administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), first in Somalia, then in Yemen, which is a lead medical position in the field.-When COVID-19 hit the globe, I was in Yemen. Indeed, I was the one of the first female doctors to join the UN Clinic medical team in Yemen. Like my home country Cameroon, Yemen desperately needs to increase the number of doctors and nurses to improve health conditions and address humanitarian needs.-My previous experience allowed me to understand both the significant role women can play in this regard and the value UN Volunteers can add in such contexts. I moved quickly to recruit, deploy and train national UN Volunteers in our UN Clinics. All while ensuring inclusion of women in the deployments, coupled with flexible schedules and remote work opportunities which promote work-life balance.-Ultimately, our work in Yemen benefited significantly from the contribution of the recruited national UN Volunteer health professionals.
-As I travel between clinics to attend to patients and help building staff capacity, I often think of my sister and how she inspired me. I also think about my children and how my own journey would inspire them.-At first, my children didn't want to study medicine. While in Cameroon, they saw me work long hours and weekends then come home tired. They struggled to embrace the career that demanded a lot of their mother's time. However, my children began to view medicine differently after I joined UNV. They began to understand how important doctors are to crisis-affected communities and now see themselves in the lives we save. This is everything to me.----------------------------Blog published on: https://www.unv.org/Success-stories/inspiration-action-i-believe-volunteers

On Saturday, 2 April at 7:00 pm, Yemen began a two-month truce agreed to by the parties of the conflict and brokered by the Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg. And at the same time, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-sponsored Yemeni-to-Yemeni peace talks is taking place in Riyadh. For the first time in seven years, these events give widespread hope among Yemenis that peace may prevail long after the two months have passed.-This good news could not come a moment too soon. The extensive humanitarian and development crises besetting the country must urgently be addressed as we are nearing a tipping point for the country of 31.8 million people.-According to the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Impact of War on Yemen reports, hundreds of thousands of deaths can be attributed to indirect effects of the conflict, not the battlefield. More people are dying because of hunger, lack of services, and degraded living conditions than of direct violence from the conflict. The protracted war has led to unrelenting damage to Yemen and its people and has degraded the social fabric.-The United Nations (UN) and those on the ground in Yemen continue to cry out about the dire situation and urgency, but multiple global crises have resulted in competing priorities. In March, the UN High Level Pledging Event for Yemen carried an urgent ask of US$ 4.3 billion to address the prevailing needs in the country. But sadly, a fraction – US$ 1.62 billion – was pledged and aid agencies must do more with less to meet the ever-increasing needs in Yemen.-What is worse is that the UN is projecting shocking food insecurity numbers by June 2022. The most comprehensive data collection exercise since the conflict began projects that 19 million people (60 per cent of the population) will face severe acute food insecurity and will be in dire need of urgent assistance. In short, two-out-of-three Yemenis will have no idea where or how they will get their next meal despite food being readily available throughout the country.-The bottom line is that as the cost of food continues to rise, its access continues to shrink. With reduced household incomes from years of unpaid salaries, and with less incoming remittances, increased taxes, and continued depreciation of the currency – particularly in the south – a family’s ability to purchase food and other critical supplies has been significantly weakened. This is simply devastating to a country that imports 90 per cent of its food.-For most people in Yemen there are no savings accounts, and nothing left for a rainy day. The majority of Yemenis live hand-to-mouth while the cost of food has skyrocketed and slips further from the most needy and desperate.  -Playing squarely into Yemenis’ food affordability is the recent surge in the cost of shipping. Shipping a container across the ocean has increased seven-fold in 18 months with bulk commodities spiking even more (March 2020 to September 2021, IMF 2022). And residual issues from COVID-19 have decreased consumers’ purchasing power even more.-Unfortunately, this will only get worse with the onslaught of the Ukrainian conflict as Yemen is dependent upon the Ukraine and Russia for over 55 per cent of its grain imports. Despite the markets being full of food, the increased prices of wheat, rice, corn, and fuel have hurled a heavy punch felt by poor Yemeni families.- -Looking Forward: Using Development Solutions to Tackle Hunger-Our recent Impact of War report projected that it is possible to change Yemen’s trajectory in one generation in the absence of conflict. But we must act now to begin to shift this paradigm.-UNDP is responding with new, cheaper, and more innovative ideas across Yemen – approaching solutions from a holistic perspective. From infrastructure to shippers, to consumers, we have been working to find answers for Yemen’s food affordability crisis.-We are doing this by rehabilitating the infrastructure of Yemen’s major seaports to create more effective and efficient processes, saving a significant amount of time and millions in shipping costs benefitting Yemeni households.-Concurrently, and for the first time in UNDP, we are working with insurance industry leaders to create an innovative insurance guarantee fund for shipping companies that not only lower the cost for the shippers but will also lower the cost of incoming commodities like fuel and food for consumers. We estimate that through these efforts, US$ 250 million can be saved annually – a cost that is now being absorbed directly by the Yemeni consumer.-And in partnership with the World Bank and others, we are working with Yemenis across the country to strengthen their businesses and employment opportunities, ultimately allowing them to purchase food and necessities for their families.-We can make a significant change in Yemen by working with Yemenis to develop solutions for food insecurity that work now. In addition to what UNDP is already doing to improve household income and lower food costs, working to lift restrictions on Yemen’s trade and investment for non-sanctioned actors will result in an unleashed economy, and Yemenis will regain their dignity of employment and salaries they deserve. These measures will help address the ever-increasing food issue in Yemen, serving to ultimately ease the reliance upon aid and carving a path to build forward better.

This also includes 4 million internally-displaced women across Yemen who regularly venture in search of safety and shelter and face increased vulnerabilities and deprivation.-International Women’s Day is when women around the world celebrate their accomplishments that serve to create a more equal world. Despite this, however, women in Yemen are still placed at the bottom of both the Gender Inequality and the World Economic Forum Gender Gap indexes.-Undoubtedly, women and girls in Yemen are hit the hardest by the conflict, with increased impact of displacement, deprivation, and distress. In addition, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the conditions for women and girls who disproportionately face lost livelihoods and unemployment. These compounded crises have further pushed women and girls deeper into extreme poverty and hunger resulting in heightened vulnerability.- -A New Threat Hiding in the Shadows-Climate change has severely impacted Yemeni women’s access to water, food, and energy. In a war-consumed country, the negative impact of climate change leaves women prone to the absence of vital resources – particularly for rural women who are almost entirely dependent upon natural and agricultural resources for their livelihood and food. This has exacerbated the already high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition they are experiencing.-Water insecurity is a constant worry for Yemenis, especially women and girls who bear the responsibility of water collection. Many women and young girls walk six or more hours daily to collect water, while others resort to drinking from unclean sources or – if they can afford it – pay high fees to have water delivered. Considerable variations in the seasonal rainfall across the country due to climate change causes erosion and environmental degradation, resulting in the loss of fertile topsoil. This directly impacts the main source of income for rural Yemenis who account for 70 per cent of the country’s 30 million people.- -Weathering Hardships-Against these adversities facing Yemeni women, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Yemen has long recognized the key role of women in building climate resilience. UNDP has put women at the heart of response – enabling them to standstill facing the challenges and leading on their local development through community participation in both decision-making and implementation processes.-Leading the Action Coalition on Feminist Action for Climate Justice, UNDP Yemen has reduced and mitigated the gender-related impact of climate change around water, food, and the energy nexus and aligned the contribution of women and men.-As rural communities in water-scarce Yemen rely on seasonal rainfalls, UNDP has sought durable solutions to mitigate and adapt to the negative impacts of water scarcity induced by climate change. As such, we have built rainwater harvesting schemes, irrigation canals and/or networks, and spate irrigation, as well as supported integrated watershed management practices and restoring degraded agricultural lands. In 2021 alone, UNDP Yemen has supported the rehabilitation and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities, in Aden and Mukalla cities that benefited over 130,000 people – 51 per cent of whom are women.-These water interventions have improved women’s access to secure and quality portable water sources. This has also contributed to safeguarding the physical and mental well-being of rural women and girls as they must no longer collect water from distant locations – allowing them to engage in other productive activities.-With the prevailing food insecurity in Yemen, women’s participation is even more crucial to preventing hunger and malnutrition and helps build food security resilience. With 50 per cent women benefiting, UNDP supported the rehabilitation of over 24,000 hectares of agricultural lands. And last year, 750 women farmers were trained on how to use seedlings and fertilizers, as well as productive agriculture inputs.- -Building Towards Sustainability-Through the World Bank’s Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YECRP), UNDP has supported the rehabilitation of irrigation channels and agricultural terraces as well as the construction of flood protection walls that benefit nearly 4,000 women. To support food security of vulnerable households, UNDP has also helped nearly 3,100 households to start their own home gardens – benefiting nearly 1,500 women. UNDP also supported over 275,000 women and 404,000 children with cash-for-nutrition services.-Energy is essential for Yemeni women’s daily lives, especially for those whose livelihoods depend upon it – including small women-led food industries. Many women benefited from access to clean energy at health centers, schools, and other public services. The women-led solar micro-grid businesses were established by Supporting Resilient Livelihoods and Food Security in Yemen Progarmme (ERRY II) providing power supply to households and markets – supporting 185,000 households accessing clean energy sources for lighting and other purposes, including 28 per cent women-headed households.-Through the Youth Leadership Programme (YLP), UNDP Yemen invests in young women’s skills and abilities to reduce man-made harm on the environment and promote climate action. Three young Yemeni women innovators and climate change actors were supported by UNDP Yemen to be later nominated to participate in global events to spread the word, including the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) and the 16th UN Climate Change Conference of Youth (COY16), the Regional Women Innovators Programme – as well as a top-three YLP nominee innovator who participated in the Regional Forum of Youth Leadership Programme 7 for her climate change invention.-UNDP will continue enhancing women’s role in mitigating and addressing women vulnerabilities to climate change by adopting an integrated water-food-energy nexus approach to build climate adaptation and resilience, harmonize interventions, and mitigate trade-offs to improve sustainability. While reducing vulnerabilities, enhancing productive roles, and strengthening decision-making chances, women and girls can be leaders in the fight against climate change in Yemen – co-leading the world towards a sustainable future.",['Icon of SDG 05'],"Goal 5  Gender equality,Yemen,Women's empowerment,Gender equality,Blog post,Auke Lootsma"

To get there, stakeholders across the region need to listen to women in all their diversity and support women to make their voices heard.-Today is International Women’s Day, and this year’s theme is Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world. The theme celebrates the enormous contributions women and girls have made around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.-It is a theme that is highly relevant in the Arab States region, where women have stood at the front lines of combatting the crisis, be it through their work in the health and social sectors, as essential workers, or their contributions in communities and family life.  The crisis has underscored both the centrality of their contributions, often invisible, and the outsized burdens women carry, as they have been stretched thin through their efforts while also bearing the brunt of social and economic impacts – in a region where even before the crisis, women in the region have been hit by the highest regional unemployment rate in the world, at 41.8 per cent.-Women leading for change-Globally, the crisis has shown that countries with women in positions of national leadership have been relatively successful in the tough battle to stem the tide or mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. The same holds true at local levels or across different types of institutions, with women’s organizations demonstrating their skills and knowledge to secure better outcomes for people and communities.-While the Arab States region has not enough women in decision-making positions in the public sector, there has been no shortage of strong examples of women leaders at all levels pushing for change over the course of the pandemic.-In Jordan, women’s groups successfully lobbied to have child-care vouchers distributed as part of COVID-response social protection, in a step towards recognition of the economic value of care work.-In Morocco, women’s groups engaged the Ministry of Justice to roll out innovative programmes that enabled women to safely report domestic violence and access support.-In Libya, a network of women’s peacebuilders spread awareness of COVID-19 through radio stations, and teamed up with a legal aid network to provide masks to inmates, distribute food and provide information to vulnerable migrant and refugee communities.-In Djibouti, the Ministry of Women persuaded the Ministry of Budget to slash taxes on feminine hygiene products, diapers and infant formula to zero.- -Women driving results-What these examples underscore is that where women of all walks of life have a seat at the table, or are able to make their voices heard, the result can be decisions, policies and laws that work better for all. Looking ahead, the key is to fully leverage the potential of women’s leadership in pandemic preparedness and response, first and foremost by listening to women and girls and engaging their insights in policy and programme development, including women with disability, who have been hit harder by the pandemic - while also moving to scale.-Across the Arab States region, and with support from core donors, UNDP works closely with partners and supporting institutions to listen to women’s voices, and to facilitate spaces at all levels for women from all backgrounds and contexts to make their voices heard. An example of this is a global sensemaking exercise that UNDP in the Arab States region initiated to capture the voices of grassroots women, peace and security advocates around the world on their role in economic and political decision making, to drive forward the Women, Peace and Security agenda.  Similarly, our Gender Justice and the Law initiative with UN Women,  UNFPA and ESCWA took into account perspectives of women leaders across the region, and our Regional Elections Project has partnered with the Organization of Arab Election Management Bodies to launch the Arab Network For Women in Elections. At the country level, UNDP is working in Jordan and Lebanon on initiatives to explore and promote positive masculinities, in light of increases of gender-based violence across the region.  And work is underway to support women supporting communities in crises and fragility settings,  such as an initiative to support a group of women in Yemen to set up and manage solar-powered mini-grids – providing affordable renewable energy to the local community in a country where half the population has no access to electricity, and at the same time creating economic opportunity for women.-Walking the Talk – With Women-UNDP also seeks to lead by example. Across the region, we have reached gender parity at senior levels within our own ranks.  Yet we must continue to engage more and more diverse women at every level of our work – so that our work continues to become more reflective of the good ideas of women of all backgrounds in our ranks and in the societies we serve. I strongly identify with the priority of supporting women within our ranks because it rings true with my own experience. I began my career as a National Officer in UNDP Algeria, and I have found within the United Nations a universe of opportunities to grow professionally, contribute ideas and serve the cause of sustainable and inclusive development.-An example just in from one of our Country Offices in the region makes clear the link between engaging women internally and in our work: During the early stages of the pandemic, a group of women staff at UNDP Tunisia County came together virtually to brainstorm priority ideas to support women across the country hit hard by the  pandemic.  The resulting initiatives provided targeted and rapid support for business continuity of women-headed small businesses, support for value chains benefitting 850 women entrepreneurs, and the kick-off of discussion on a strategic partnership with a large private-sector company to promote women’s entrepreneurship in the COVID-19 context and beyond. The colleagues recognized that the ideas would not have come to fruition had they not taken it upon themselves, with management support, to forge a way ahead.  It is one example, but one of many across the Arab States region—all of which started with listening to women and enabling women to lead.",['Icon of SDG 05'],"Goal 5  Gender equality,Women's empowerment,Khalida Bouzar,Gender equality,Blog post"

Surely the pace of reform is too slow, and we know that the pandemic is threatening to push us back into the kitchen and even further away from the board room. Even before the pandemic, women’s leadership statistics were at best “disappointing”. Despite being 25 years out from the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, women still only account for 25 percent of the world’s parliamentarians and less than seven percent of heads of state. When it comes to economic decision-making and financial power, in other words the stuff that really counts, the sad reality is that women comprise a miniscule number of the top brass in the corporate world--only seven percent of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. Their earning potential remains well below that of their male colleagues, with a gender pay gap averaging 20 percent. Juxtapose this with women’s education: In nearly all regions, women make up a higher level of tertiary graduates, yet despite this, continue to lag behind men when it comes to leadership in nearly all professions.
 COVID-19 threatens to reverse years of progress for gender equality and women’s leadership. Women who carried a disproportionate share of unpaid care work in the home, estimated at three times as much as men, are now also having to manage household hygiene, homeschool their children, while also sustaining their livelihoods. This, in a context where women account for more than 54 percent of overall job losses while accounting for only 39 percent of formal employment.
And everywhere in the world more and more women experience violence in their homes, on the streets and in the workplace. The pandemic has only intensified this shadow pandemic of violence against women, in every region and cultural context. It is estimated there are at least 15 million cases of gender-based violence for every month of lockdown. Staying safe while feeding and educating one’s family is no small challenge. While right now women may not have the time to put towards professional or political advancement, I would argue that betting on women’s leadership is the best way for us to propel our nations out of this pandemic and this requires concrete policies and action.
Even before the pandemic the World Economic Forum argued that closing the gender gap in economic participation by 25 percent by 2025 could increase global GDP by US$5.3 trillion. We now know that companies with more gender-balanced boards and stronger female leadership report higher returns on equity, sales and invested capital. Look no further than New Zealand, Taiwan, Germany, Norway, and some of the small island states led by women such as Barbados, Aruba, and Sint Maarten, to see how adept women political leaders are managing the crisis. A recent article by the Harvard Business review showed that confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the first half year of 2020 were six times lower in countries led by women.
The world is also counting on a group of outstanding women to steer our global economic recovery, with Janet Yellen heading the US Treasury; Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, recently appointed to lead the World Trade Organization.
Imagine how much better off we would be if we had equal participation of women in all leadership positions and across all sectors and an equal sharing of the burden of care in the household. This would mean more women in non-traditional sectors such as policing, engineering, in executive management in the public service and private companies and as business owners and investors.
Realizing this dream will require governments,  private companies and individuals working together. It will require rapid changes in discriminatory laws and practices that deny women’s basic equal rights, From decisions concerning their own body, to those effecting their economic rights. It would also mean policies that reduce the care burden on women, eliminate discrimination in tax and fiscal policy, and a radical increase in investments to ensure services to enable women to realize the right to feel safe in their home, on public transport, in public spaces and in the workplace. Here in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 39 percent of households are headed by a woman and 26 percent are single-parent households headed by women, policies that enable women to safely re-enter the workforce are also the vital antidotes to preventing families from sliding back into poverty while safeguarding economic recovery.

My first memories were on his ship and the first five years of my life were spent at sea with him and my family. I still relish listening to his tales of the great oceans and vivid memories of his adventures. -The love of the sea has never left me. As a young business and economics student, I rode my bicycle to the Port of Rotterdam to watch the ships sailing out to sea, soaking in the salty air, and watching the hustle and bustle in a seaport. Even from a distance, the port’s economic importance can hardly escape anyone; they can either breathe life into a country or cause it to suffocate.-Ports in Yemen are no different. As a matter of fact, they may play an even more significant role than in other countries. In recent years – due to the conflict and other facts – Yemen has increasingly relied upon food imports to feed its people. Many farmers have turned to much more lucrative cash crops such as qat instead of producing consumable and nutritious food. This has resulted in Yemen having to import 90 per cent of its food requirements, all of which passes through Yemen’s ports. - -The ports are crucial to Yemenis having access to food, but not necessarily with them being able to eat. You see, the food shortage in Yemen is unique and not at all what you would expect. Yemen is on the brink of famine because of the cost associated with the imported foods, not because it is unavailable; nearly half the population receives food aid from the international community. The conflict has thrust many out of a job, those with employment must work for less pay, and civil workers have not been paid regularly – or fully – in years. -To put it plainly: The markets are overflowing with food, but Yemenis cannot afford it.-One of the contributing factors to the high food prices in Yemen is the cost of doing business in the seaports. Damage from the war and years of neglect have had severe negative impact on the ports’ infrastructure and equipment, leading to congestion and long waiting times before vessels can berth. In addition, “war risk” insurance is being imposed on ships arriving to Yemeni ports and terminals by their insurers; the highest of which is in Aden. -Congestion, insurance premiums, and inspections are causing significant additional expenses for importers – nearly doubling the price of shipping for every container. The costs are being directly absorbed by consumers at the markets, grocery stores and shops – a cost that few Yemenis can afford. -To help put food on the average Yemeni table, UNDP is working in a unique public-private partnership with the Ports of Rotterdam and the national Port Authorities in Yemen to find manageable solutions. - -In July 2019, we assessed the Ports of Hodeidah, Salif, and Ras Issa in the north and now we are undertaking similar exercise in the Ports of Aden and Mukalla in the south. These technical assessments are crucial to helping ensure Yemen’s major ports can function more optimally – including in compliance with international standards and with efficiency and safety.-If we work to fix vital port infrastructure such as the cranes, the navigation system, the storage capacity, and the buoys – for example – then it will increase the ship numbers that sail into the ports, decrease the very expensive time spent in dock to offload cargo, and decrease the cost of insurance for shipping lines and trading companies wanting to do business in Yemen. These are costs absorbed directly by the consumers – one of the issues associated with the high cost of food in Yemen.-In crisis countries like Yemen, investment in infrastructure is often overlooked, but UNDP views this as an extremely important effort to facilitate the entry of humanitarian assistance, to build peace, and to invest in the development and future growth of Yemen. This – like many of our other recovery projects – will play a vital role in helping Yemen to build forward better. -As a student standing at the Port of Rotterdam, I never imagined that I would be standing at the ports of Yemen – a half a world away from Rotterdam – watching ships sail in and out and observing the sea Captains like my dad and their crews. But the difference now is that the ships’ precious cargo helps save over 24 million people who mostly rely 100 per cent on the food and humanitarian aid to survive the ongoing conflict and their harsh reality. -The work we are embarking upon with the Port of Rotterdam and the Port Authorities will revitalize, rehabilitate, and modernize the ports – resulting in reduced costs for Yemeni households and allowing them to afford food for their families. This presents them with opportunities to use the extra savings for school, food, and shelter – and ultimately provides them with hope for their own future and that of Yemen. - -About the Author-Mr. Auke Lootsma has been serving in Yemen as the Resident Representative since February 2019.

-With a mortality rate five times higher than the global average, the impact of war on access to healthcare, lack of hygiene and sanitation, COVID-19 is a crisis on top of crisis in Yemen. Citizens are reliant on dilapidated health infrastructure and poor water and solid waste management services. And while most of the world was observing strict lockdown, 3.5 million Yemenis were living in displacement and famine was knocking on the door of over 8 million. Furthermore, with long-standing internal and external embargoes, it is difficult to import essential goods.-A scenario like this could easily have become a narrative of heartbreak and loss, but Yemeni youth had other ideas.-Having witnessed the talents of 12 young unemployed mechatronic engineers at the Yemen Hackathon 2020, we asked them: How can you help Yemen fight back against COVID-19? With their know-how, skills, and commitment, the were surely able and determined to overcome significant challenges facing Yemen in the face of COVID-19.- - -Long delays and the high cost of importing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), disinfectant tunnels, ventilators, face shields, and hospital gowns, was limiting the ability of Yemen’s first responders to safely care for people who contracted COVID-19. But local solutions are sustainable. If UNDP could provide them with the funding to purchase essential materials and components for the design of critical medical equipment, the mechatronic engineers could ensure affordable, accessible healthcare in Yemen.-Armed with technical skill and passion, these engineers conceived of a future in which locally produced, affordable equipment was able to save lives. But they needed support. By UNDP connecting them to Engineers without Borders (EWB) and University of Wisconsin (UW), the engineers tapped into global medical expertise and set their goal to produce a product that would pass World Health Organisation standards.-With the pandemic requiring safety in distance, all communication was done online. In Yemen, the local engineers faced weak connectivity and disrupted electricity, making virtual exchanges sometimes difficult. But perseverance and long hours soon resulted in the first prototypes including a disinfectant tunnel that also records human temperature, hospital gowns, face shields, and a mask making machine with the capacity to produce 72,000 masks per day.-A key component for the engineers’ success was using local, affordable raw materials. This not only overcame import limitations, but presented the added opportunity of bringing production to scale with the help of local micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs). MSMEs struggling to make adequate sales during the crisis, now had the chance to start producing new products that offered two extremely important benefits: increased revenue and helping to keep communities safe during the pandemic.-The pandemic has resulted in nearly 50 per cent of Yemeni micro-enterprises and 90 per cent of MSMEs being forced to close or reduce their staffing. Reduced revenue limited the buying power for business owners and their staff and pushed vulnerable populations closer to hunger and famine.-But with the increase in demand for PPEs a new opportunity arose for MSMEs and the local economy, creating a synergistic relationship with the engineers. The success of the mechatronic engineers could result in new jobs and more stable income for Yemenis too.-With the engineer’s designs, over 2,000 UNDP-supported MSMEs have produced more than 52,000 masks, 300 hospital gowns, and 4000 litres of liquid soap have been produced – resulting inover USD 13,000 in profit.-But what if the prototypes are produced at scale? Local production capacity would increase and the potential for Yemeni-led production for national – and possibly international markets – could boost local businesses and support a stronger local and national economy.-Over the coming months, UNDP Yemen will continue to support the engineers in rolling-out their designs. MSMEs will be able to purchase PPE producing machines and be shown how to make critical medical equipment at scale for local and affordable consumption.- -These self-determined youth believe that everyone has something to offer and that if we work together, we can fight the pandemic locally, nationally, and globally.-But it goes beyond COVID-19. Empowering Yemeni youth through skills training and funding support, ensures local and sustainable solutions to the on-going socio-economic problems and bottlenecks of humanitarian and development crises in Yemen today.

By: Tracy Vienings, YECRP Project Manager
-In a country already ravaged by conflict, COVID-19 is exacerbating the Yemen crisis, deepening the devastating social and economic impact that will leave lasting scars on Yemen. The country’s healthcare system has been strained following five years of conflict, with only 51% of its centres fully functional, six testing centers open, and limited supplies of medicine, equipment, clean water, sanitation, and personal protection equipment available – putting Yemenis at particular risk of the highly contagious disease.-Already the neediest place on Earth, Yemen was struggling to cope with outbreaks of cholera, malaria, and dengue fever before the first case of COVID-19 was reported in April. Weakened immune systems exacerbate recovery and survival rates. To date, the government has reported over 1,800 confirmed cases and over 500 deaths, though the numbers are “almost certainly much higher” given the limited number of testing kits. There is an urgent and compelling opportunity to support the country to respond to and mitigate devastation.
-Since the conflict broke out in March 2015, over 3.6 million people have been displaced; one-third of whom live in overcrowded camps and informal settlements that struggle with proper sanitation. Approximately 7.4 million Yemenis need treatment or preventative services for malnutrition, including 2 million children. As Yemen relies on imports for 80% – 90% of its citizens’ basic needs, it is particularly vulnerable to the pandemic’s disruptions to the world economy and restrictions on the movement of goods. 
-It is vital that the humanitarian and development aid that has been provided to millions of Yemenis not come to a halt during the pandemic.-Despite the devastation, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been successful in using its ongoing programmes and projects, particularly the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YECRP), to help people prepare for the pandemic and survive the ensuing crisis.-Supporting Yemen’s Resilience and Recovery Efforts
-Preparing for, responding to, and recovering from COVID-19 in a country at war calls for a coordinated public health effort at local, national, and international levels to ensure swift, effective, and targeted actions. Guided by the latest evidence and focused on upholding human rights, UNDP has helped the world’s most vulnerable groups during past disease outbreaks and pandemics.
-UNDP’s ongoing partnership with the World Bank through the USD $400 million YECRP – locally implemented by the Social Fund for Development (SFD) and the Public Works Project (PWP) – has been contributing to the revival of the Yemen economy and alleviating famine and food shortages since 2016. This has been possible through large-scale cash-for-work and wage employment projects, support to small businesses, and repairs to socio-economic infrastructure.
-YECRP’s impact has been vast. Reaching 300 of Yemen’s 333 districts and working across all 22 governorates, nearly 400,000 Yemenis have been provided with work opportunities and cash to purchase food and provide a decent living for their families. An additional 5 million people have gained access to critical services such as water, food, health, education, and roads.
-To enable a faster response to COVID-19, YECRP is strengthening social protection by extending the coverage of existing programmes including food aid, direct cash transfers, cash-for-work, and public work schemes. YECRP’s COVID-19 response is being implemented by SFD and PWP, in partnership with UNDP and in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.
-Supply Capacity
-YECRP targets COVID-affected small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) with emergency financing, in-kind grants, grassroots awareness, hygiene kits, and is also facilitating mobile banking services. Specifically, Yemen’s Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS) has adapted its project scheme to provide immediate cash transfers to 8,645 farmers, fishers, and livestock breeders to cover the cost of seeds, fertilizers, and to sanitize equipment. Nearly 1000 participants have received cash transfers to guard against the impact of COVID-19, as well as technical assistance to maintain and improve their productivity in the face of this pandemic.-To support local food production for over 50,000 households, new sub-projects focus upon land rehabilitation, home gardens, and household-based water cisterns. Unskilled workers are recruited from the community and skilled workers are being brought in as needed from nearby villages and/or districts that are free of the virus. In addition, beneficiaries receive technical advice and education on COVID-19 through field consultants.-Cash Assistance-The fastest way to assist in an outbreak and corresponding lockdown is through massive multi-purpose, unconditional cash assistance. That is why YECRP plans to increase cash assistance to over 100,000 households that have children under age 5; pregnant or lactating mothers; an elderly family member; and/or a person with a disability.odeidah alone, over 47,300 vulnerable pregnant and lactating women with malnourished children received cash and monetary support (YER 60,000 or approximately USD 120) for three months. The remaining 53,000 in seven additional governorates (Abyan, AlMahweet, Amran, Hadhramout, Hajjah, Lahj, and Shabwa) women are being enrolled to receive their cash assistance by September 2020.-Information Management
-Poor media outlets and a general lack of trust make it difficult to deliver behaviour-change messaging. Accordingly, SFD’s longstanding Tamkeen (Empowerment) Programme supported by YECRP has utilized its nationwide local and community networks to coordinate closely with local health authorities to prepare Yemenis against COVID-19.-To educate the public and participate in food distribution and assistance for households under quarantine, 4,000 youth were trained and employed. Chosen from SFD’s RUAWFD youth programme, they arranged door-to-door sessions through 2,500 community educators and nearly 6,000 youth members, who reached almost 54,000 direct beneficiaries. Close to 10,000 posters were also placed in common areas and cash-for-work sites to raise awareness of COVID-19 and preventive practices were encouraged through distributing kits containing masks, soap, chlorine, and sanitizers.-Consistent with WHO and national emergency committee guidelines, the educators practiced physical distancing and avoided assembling residents en masse.-Supporting Livelihoods and Service Delivery-YECRP will continue building resilience and help citizens sustain their livelihoods through cash transfers and cash-for-work modalities. Priority is given to vulnerable households and SMEs that are directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.-Aligned with the broader goal of maintaining stability during the pandemic and rebuilding in anticipation of life post-war, YECRP has provided 10,400 cash-for-work workers with masks and hand sanitizer and COVID-19 prevention awareness. Their projects focused on constructing rainwater harvesting cisterns, repairing roads, protecting agricultural lands, and were diversified to include tree planting, sidewalk painting, and cleaning. Additionally, PWP is constructing 50 latrines in highly dense urban centers, outfitted with hand-washing stations.
-YECRP has played a crucial role in helping vulnerable Yemenis cope with the impacts of war and is playing a vital role in assisting Yemen to respond to the pandemic while preparing to recover from its economic and social devastation.-***
-Funded and supported by the World Bank, the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YECRP) is implemented by the Social Fund for Development (SFD) and the Public Works Project (PWP) in partnership with UNDP. The USD $400 million project provides economic stimuli in the form of large cash-for-work projects, support to small businesses, and labor-intensive repairs of socio-economic assets, benefiting vulnerable local households and communities across Yemen.

Unchartered territory, an invisible virus and a laissez faire approach will most certainly increase the likelihood of a devastating outbreak among an already severely malnourished population. There is no doubt that the already shattered health system and limited testing capacity will quickly be overwhelmed.-There are 38 COVID-19 hospitals across the country, all of whom have fully occupied beds, yet Yemen reported only 253 COVID-19 infections with 50 deaths as of 28 May. This is likely a gross underestimation of the virus’ spread across the country with the reality being much higher in both the number of people infected and those dying. Due to factors such as cost, fear, denied access to hospitals due to lack of space and a shortage of healthcare workers, Yemenis are dying at home – undetected, undocumented and possibly having spread the virus to their loved ones.-COVID-19 is a crisis on top of existing crises such as war, famine, and other rampant communicable diseases like cholera, malaria, and dengue fever. The country, having already faced so much, is yet again facing another heart-breaking situation.-Before COVID-19, with over half the hospitals defunct, Yemen was already battling a degraded and fragile healthcare system that collapsed after a protracted and devastating five-year war. Authorities were already struggling to address existing issues, but now with the addition of COVID-19, it is impossible for them to properly respond to the outbreak. Across the country, there is no money to pay hospital and support staff, very little personal protective equipment, and scant numbers of tests, making it impossible for anyone to know the real numbers of COVID-19 positive cases.-Already fragile, the virus will further ravage Yemen’s livelihoods and food security. With the difficulty of physical distancing in Yemen, authorities may be forced to choose between saving people from COVID-19 or saving their livelihoods. If they choose to demand physical distancing, saving them now, people will not be able to work to make the money necessary to purchase food and they will likely die from hunger later.-Already over half of Yemenis are food insecure as income has plummeted and food imports have increased to 90 per cent. Unfortunately, compared to pre-conflict levels, food and essential non-food commodity prices continue to be high due to currency depreciation and COVID-19 movement restrictions. Furthermore, remittances play a major role in the economy with billions sent flowing into the country annually. But due to COVID-19, this has drastically reduced and other access to income is expected to further decline due to business disruptions and reduced purchasing power among employers. The bottom line is that food is unaffordable and may soon be unavailable to the average Yemeni; it is likely millions will go hungry.-Without an urgent and effective socio-eco­nomic response, Yemen will continue to suffer, and Yemeni lives and livelihoods will be threatened for generations to come. We have seen how devastating the interruption of social services and economic breakdown can be during the West African Ebola outbreak where more died from this than the virus itself. We cannot let this happen again in Yemen; we must connect health and socio-economic needs.-Despite COVID-19 beginning to wreak havoc on Yemen, UNDP is continuing to deliver at capacity in programmes that address socio-economic-related issues such as cash-for-work, public work schemes and engaging micro-, small and medium enterprises. In the fight against the virus’ spread, we are continuing to make a difference in Yemen and are uniquely positioned to lead Yemen’s COVID-19 national socio-economic impact response in coordination with the UN system.-Globally, we have developed five interactive pillars based upon our previous experiences in communicable outbreaks; the same approach will be followed in Yemen. When combined, they will likely prove effective in helping to preserve and rebuild the country’s society.-The COVID-19 pandemic will fundamentally affect Yemen’s society and economy – we must recognize that it is more than a health crisis. Poverty and inequalities will be increased on a global scale and the virus has great potential to further devastate the world’s worst humanitarian and development crisis. Decisions that are made today will affect Yemen tomorrow.-Yemen continues to need high levels of assistance because of a combination of conflict and poor macroeconomic conditions, but the 2020 humanitarian assistance funding has plummeted and much needed funding for COVID-19 is being diverted from existing programmes. This is causing the majority of the UN Yemen’s programmes to either shutter or rework their existing outreach, ultimately reaching fewer Yemenis during their time of greatest need. We must continue to ensure that we do not forsake Yemen now when they are facing the direst time in their history.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Arab states,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goals in action,Coronavirus COVID-19,Disaster recovery,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Yemen,Auke Lootsma,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The country’s acute vulnerability to the virus stems from over five years of conflict and an already devastated health system.-In a country of over 30 million, there are three doctors and seven hospital beds per 10,000 people, only 51 per cent of health facilities are fully operational and two-thirds of Yemenis have no access to basic healthcare. With limited testing capacity – including only three testing sites in Sana’a, Aden and Mukalla – the spread of COVID-19 will bring untold human suffering and will crush Yemen’s healthcare system.
-Many Yemenis face underlying or unad­dressed conditions that place them at greater risk and undermine the preparedness and response to COVID-19. Some of these include lack of food, health services and infrastructure as outlined in UNDP Yemen’s Impact of War studies. Even something as seemingly simple as handwashing is a luxury in Yemen as half the population lacks access to safe wa­ter, sanitation and hygiene. And social distancing for poor families and the 3.6 million internally displace persons who live in overcrowded locations appears impossible.-Combatting COVID-19 must not come at the expense of vital humanitarian assistance that will help address these issues. An insufficient humanitarian response will only force Yemen’s vulnerable population to adopt negative coping strategies to survive and will in­crease the risk of famine in a country where already more than 10 million people do not know from where their next meal will come.-Simply put, the lack of funding for COVID-19 and the defunding of the Humanitarian Response Plan cannot continue without catastrophic consequences. Already, 31 of Yemen's 41 United Nations programmes must either reduce their assistance or shut down completely if there is no more money.
-The United Nations and our international and national partners have been working to create an effective and rapid health response that will help suppress the transmission, flatten the curve, and likely save countless lives. But we must not forget that a key underlying component of COVID-19 and its spread lies in severe inequality and deeply rooted poverty.
-Unless there are robust social protection and economic recovery elements in the response, the pandemic will ravage the poorest and most unequal country in world. Yemenis need steady access to basic needs such as healthcare, food and income to help prepare for and fight the virus, and to allow any health response to be effective. Additional money is urgently needed to further scale-up social protection programmes and to safeguard Yemen’s fragile economy.
-To ensure the COVID-19 curve is flattened, bold steps must be taken across Yemen to enable an effective health response.
-Now more than ever, bold action, solidarity and cooperation are needed to see this crisis through. We must work together to ensure the Yemeni people get what they deserve – a life without fear of conflict and diseases, and a life with dignity and hope for a better future.
-Yemen can’t wait.

But watching the invisible Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) tsunami crashing through countries – creating a global health crisis and economic catastrophe – we are preparing for landfall in Yemen.-With COVID-19, Yemen will face a new, merciless enemy that will be unbeatable if the armed conflict continues. It will threaten the fragile gains made, making the world’s worst humanitarian and development crisis even more dire. Ending the fighting now will allow for a UN-led mediated process to end the war and will help prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in an already tenuous environment.-The protracted conflict has decimated what was already a very weak health system. An outbreak would overwhelm it, with the most vulnerable hit the hardest. UNDP Yemen’s Impact of War studies show that, by the end of 2019, the conflict had thrust Yemen’s development back by 21 years and delayed achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 31 years. The conflict has left less than 50 per cent of Yemen’s hospitals and clinics fully operational, and most lack qualified staff, medicine and often electricity.-The question is then: How can we prepare, respond, and recover in a country at war?-On 25 March, the UN Secretary-General called for a ceasefire in Yemen to help avert a COVID-19 disaster. This was followed by the UN Special Envoy for Yemen encouraging the warring parties to act now as “Battlefields are dividing Yemen and making it harder to combat the possible outbreak of COVID-19.”-All the warring parties responded positively; however, follow-through will be what saves potentially millions of lives. Everyone must put differences aside, stop the fighting and coordinate efforts to help mitigate COVID-19’s deadly spread. There must be local, national and international coordinated public health policy actions to ensure Yemen’s swift and effective responses.-UNDP has learned from disease outbreaks and past pandemics that enable us to develop effective responses focused on the most vulnerable groups that are driven by solidarity, science, and human rights. For COVID-19 in Yemen, we are contributing to the UN response through preparedness, mitigation, and recovery by delivering in four pillars:-1.       Strengthening the first line of defense-Strengthening health systems, supply chains, doctors and nurses at the front lines of defense is key. Protecting heroic health workers – including access to face masks and protective clothing – and strong partnerships with authorities will help ensure Yemenis have equal access and treatment to healthcare.-Led by the UN Resident Coordinator and the World Health Organization (WHO) – and in coordination with the authorities – UNDP will support procuring much needed supplies, rehabilitating critical infrastructure, and delivering critical equipment. To reach across frontlines, we will work to empower and strengthen local governance actors through financial and technical support while boosting civil society partnerships to ensure effective service delivery.
-2.       Flattening the curve
-Learning from global experiences, this is most effective when allowing for social distancing, working from home, closing schools, and postponing large gatherings of people.
-UNDP is already supporting containment strategy efforts of authorities and WHO to slow the virus’ spread by introducing additional measures within UNDP and our programming.
-3.       Protecting now and in the future
-To enable a faster recovery, we must strengthen social protection by extending the coverage of existing programmes including food aid, direct cash transfers, cash-for-work, and public work schemes. Essential to this will be protecting prison populations, IDP settlements and other congested areas from COVID-19 spreading.
-UNDP is working with authorities and implementing partners to scale up existing programming in these areas throughout Yemen.
-4.       Stimulating the economy
-Yemen is already suffering from a collapse of economic infrastructure, unpaid salaries, and a lack of jobs.
-UNDP will rely upon our World Bank, European Union, and other partnerships to expand existing and to develop new programmes as we remain committed to creating jobs through our projects, increasing support to Small and Medium Enterprises, supporting local value-chains like farming, and strengthening public-private partnerships.
-To help ensure COVID-19 does not become another disaster in Yemen, the war must stop now. With its tidal wave barreling down on Yemen’s shores, we must all rally around the common goal of defeating the virus.

Steeped in culture and rich in World Heritage Sites, Yemen once had a flourishing economy that played a vital role in the world’s ancient history in trade, architecture and innovation. Modern history, however, has painted a much more devastating picture for millions of Yemenis.  -Yemen was already poor before the war began in 2015. People lived on an average of US $4.5 a day. Unemployment hovered at 52 per cent. -In 2016, after a rapid decline due to the conflict, the average Yemeni lived on an incredibly low US $1.8 a day, and the unemployment spiked above 60 per cent. -The devastation of war-The ongoing conflict has had a devastating impact, causing poverty to spiral out of control and hurling the country back decades in its development. Many children are no longer being educated. Hospitals, power plants and roads have been destroyed. Wells are going dry, and many of those that have water have been contaminated with disease-causing bacteria because of people having to defecate in the open. Millions in need are not able to get healthcare. Once thriving community markets across the country are no longer operating. Mines and unexploded ordinance plague even the smallest villages, not allowing people to farm or walk freely around their communities, or their animals to graze in the fields.-Market places, small businesses and other means of potential income have shuttered, limiting the ability of Yemenis to earn an income. This has left millions unable to afford food, clean water and cooking fuel.-Reality check-It’s not that these things are unavailable in Yemen; they are. But people do not have enough money because of lack of income, high prices, and the continuously fluctuating currency. What someone was able to be purchase last month, last week or even yesterday, is out of reach today. The ever increasing cost of basic items leaves the option of buying lifesaving and critical items like food and water out of reach for millions. The lack of disposable income also means that families are unable to afford crucial medical treatment for malnutrition or water-borne diseases.- -Nearly 80 per cent of the 24 million Yemenis need assistance and protection. In a country with over 2,000 kilometres of coastline, amazingly, two-thirds of the 333 districts are in a state of pre-famine. Out of 20 million Yemenis who have insufficient food, 9.6 million don’t know where their next meal will come from and on the edge of famine. And an astounding 240,000 are facing horrific levels of hunger and are barely surviving. -Around 3.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - more than 600,000 in 2018 alone. Displacement is one of the key factors in the famine as people flee to places that are not able to support them, and they leave their families, homes and jobs behind.  The worst hunger is concentrated in areas that saw the fiercest conflict last year.-“After being forced to flee my home, my children and I went to bed hungry many nights. We didn’t find enough food to eat and there were times I told my children I wasn’t hungry so that whatever food I put on the table would be enough for them.” — Samiha-There are many international organizations working on the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, but UNDP has a unique role in the ongoing response. We tackle immediate and ongoing needs in Yemen during the crisis, while continuing to help people, communities and institutions prepare for a future when the crisis is over.-We respond to food insecurity by helping fishermen and farmers continue to work. We provide cash-for-work and employment for people who have no other income. We promote the dignity of Yemenis as they rebuild their communities brick-by-brick, road-by-road. We provide solar power to allow schools to continue, hospitals to provide vaccines and small businesses to run late into the night.-In 2019 and beyond, with our implementing partners, UNDP continues to work with Yemen through one of their darkest hours.-Emergency employment-UNDP engages Yemenis around the country in emergency and temporary work opportunities in the construction and rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure – such as wells, toilets, roads and schools – and in the delivery of social services like post-traumatic stress and nutrition counseling.-Our cash-for-work and wage employment benefits Yemenis right away by providing income and improving access to clean water, hospitals, schools and markets. Our emergency employment projects specifically target the most vulnerable – youth, women and the displaced – to help ensure the possibility of a stable income to sometimes otherwise forgotten or ignored populations.-Small- and micro-businesses-UNDP support for small- and micro-businesses quickly boosts local markets and – in the longer term – generates income and employment opportunities. We offer training and start-up grants to help ensure businesses succeed.-Infrastructure development-The prolonged conflict in Yemen has required considerable investment in repair, rehabilitation and construction of health facilities, schools, roads, electricity, water and other areas. Repairing and constructing these helps Yemenis get critical health and nutrition services. It enables children to continue to go to school, prevents the spread of diseases such as cholera, and helps protect against food insecurity.-Clean water and roads boost economies, resulting in increased productivity and sales for farmers, livestock producers and fishermen. Ensuring and improving these critical services reduces the need for humanitarian assistance.
-Solar energy-The demand for reliable energy sources in Yemen is high and increasing. UNDP solar projects prioritize health facilities, schools, and water and sanitation infrastructure. Solar energy also helps keep businesses and markets going. UNDP is addressing food insecurity and famine risk within Yemen through ventures such as water pumping for irrigation and access to clean water for humans and livestock.-Mine action-UNDP and partners want to ensure a safer environment to help Yemen build back better and stronger than before.-We work throughout Yemen to reduce or eliminate the impact that explosive ordnance has on the civilian population, infrastructure and economy. Through our partner, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Center (YEMAC), we support field operations that survey and clear mine-laden areas throughout the country. With nearly 1,000 deployable deminers, YEMAC has teams on the ground across the country working in the most dangerous areas.-By working with communities through our local partners, UNDP is helping to rebuild basic infrastructure that will help Yemenis rebound from the conflict and build resilience to potential difficulties in the future.- -Read More",[],"Development and mine action,Crisis response,Yemen,Blog post,Renewable energy"

Too often, conflict entrenches poverty even deeper – propelling communities, institutions and countries into a vicious cycle.-Before the war, Yemen was already a tremendously impoverished country. People lived on an average of USD $4.5 a day and unemployment was 52 per cent. The impact of the war was evident just two years into the conflict. In 2016, the average Yemeni lived on USD $1.8 a day with unemployment estimated at above 60 per cent. Severe poverty rates were estimated to be between 62 – 78 percent.-The current numbers are unknown, but Yemen continues to fall further and further into despair. An estimated 21 million people (75 per cent of the population) are in desperate need of humanitarian or protection assistance today. An astounding 10 million Yemenis suffer from famine and don’t know from where their next meal is coming. Two million are internally displaced.-As the Secretary General of United Nations announced the agreements that developed from the Sweden Peace Talks, I am hopeful it is a first step towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict of Yemen. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Yemen, has been on the ground despite the ongoing conflict - on the front lines - working to reach the poorest and most vulnerable while implementing life-saving activities and tackling the cycle of poverty.  -Continuously present in Yemen for over 50 years, UNDP has seen and experienced the rapid decline of Yemen’s society. We are painfully aware of the high stakes – the potential slip into an abyss from which it will take generations to recover. Already, we estimate that four years of conflict have wiped out over two decades of development. With the renewed hopes for a peace, we must redouble our efforts to prevent the downward spiral from spinning beyond the point of no return.-To help combat this, UNDP and the World Bank have partnered to launch the unique Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YERCP) – a project that effectively responds to the famine related needs of the Yemenis, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. This was the first time the World Bank was able to unlock such substantial financing from its International Development Associatation to work through UN agencies and to keep critical development projects flowing during a crisis.-With this essential financing from the World Bank, our emergency response work has provided nearly 2.5 million people across the country with access to key services such as water, revitalized farm land, as well as rebuilt schools and roads. By keeping public services open, empowering people to run small businesses, and paying farmers, livestock keepers and fishermen to keep producing, it helps strengthen the resilience of the people and the economy.-Through funding from the World Bank’s support, UNDP has scaled-up our livelihood projects from only a few locations to being present in 95 per cent of the country and in all 22 Yemen governorates. Locally, we are working together with two already well-established public institutions – the Social Fund for Development and the Public Works Project – to continue to scale up the delivery of critical services. Our assistance has been vital in preserving their own capacity and helping them to continue providing crucial services to communities.-Our efforts are designed to complement the ongoing humanitarian assistance. In our programming, we recognize that not only do people need shelter, protection, and food – but a strong future requires more. People also need jobs to enable them to buy basic needs for their families. They need functioning markets where they can go to buy these items. They need assets. They need to be able to invest for now as well as for their future. Thanks to our partnership with the World Bank, UNDP has helped approximately 2.1 million Yemenis through cash-for-work programs, enabling families to purchase critical basic needs by providing nearly 6.8 million working days.-The unprecedented partnership with the World Bank means that UNDP’s work is helping communities survive the crisis by providing support to local institutions and communities to gain access to these critical services, as well as help them invest in their future. This helps Yemenis keep their dignity and hope alive for what comes next. ",[],"Blog post,World Bank,Jobs and livelihoods,Partnerships,Auke Lootsma"

I had been selected for UNLEASH, a global initiative that brings together top talent from all over the world to work on real, scalable solutions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).-During the UNLEASH Innovation Lab, there was a presentation on the UNDP Accelerator Labs.  It was then that I heard that Zambia was one of the 60 countries that would lead in the first phase of implementing the Accelerator Labs. I was intrigued and decided to learn more about the lab which was meant to be for designing, implementing, and accelerating solutions towards the SDGs.  -My interest was because I was going to commence my 16-month leadership journey with UNDP Zambia in the next few days’ time. My curiosity was ignited and before arriving in the country, I was already looking forward to seeing the Accelerator Lab in action. As a successful candidate of  the African Young Women Leaders Programme, a joint fellowship between the African Union and UNDP to employ, power, and equip female young leaders with professional and personal skills , the news of such an initiative and investment on the African continent made me realize the potential of African youth to innovate for development.-I did not imagine at that time that during my fellowship I would be fortunate enough to work with the Accelerator Lab team, through the Country Office Gender Unit to coordinate, co-design, and co-implement the piloting of COVID Compliant Market Models in response to the disruptive COVID-19 outbreak.  Dubbed as  Safe Communities, Safe Markets Project, the pilot was implemented in three markets in the city of Lusaka.-Through working with the Accelerator Lab as part of my fellowship I was able to rethink “the way to do development’’ through designing and implementing sustainable home-grown solutions to complex development problems.-In a bid to mitigate long term impact on the small informal business sector and provide for business continuity during the COVID-19 outbreak, the UNDP Accelerator Lab and UNDP Gender teams in partnership with the Lusaka City Council (LCC), Ministry of Health (MoH) and working closely with market committees from the three residential areas of Nyumba Yanga, Chilenje and Lilanda designed and developed a model market that promises to help businesses in the community markets to continue operating while minimising the risk of contracting the virus.-‘’ We cannot allow precious lives to be lost when we have the power to do something to stop the scourge’’- Mr.Roland Seri, UNDP DRR.-While the closure of the crowded markets would have been justifiable to limit the contagion of COVID-19, however such a measure would have dangerously impacted food security and economic livelihoods. The closure of the markets would have resulted in negative consequences on the Zambia’s.-attainment of the SDGs particularly SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG3 (Good Health and Well Being), SDG5 (Gender Equality), and SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).-My role as the fellow on the project was to ensure coordination. With multiple partners involved and multiple arms of the project happening silmuntaenosuly (trainings, procurement of items, managing the production of communications, planning of the launch, and distribution) coordination was key for successful project outcomes.- Through working on ‘bringing different elements of the project seamlessly together’’, I was able to better understand UNDP’s integrator role that reflects a multidimensional approach to development. I further was able to conclude that on a larger scale this integration and coordination between various partners and sectors is essential for the achievement of the SDGs.-UNDP tirelessly worked with the key departments of public health from LCC and MoH; and through established community structures namely Community Based Volunteers and Safety Market Officers, to ensure targeted interventions will have community ownership therefore sustainability.-As an entry point, 75 community-based volunteers and markets safety officers were trained using existing MoH community training modules with the aim to reach households at community levels on the importance of complying to health guidelines.-During the trainings, which I attended, marketeers came up with their own rules on how to keep the markets safe. Each market committee decided who would be responsible for filling the water tanks? Who would be responsible for maintaining the thermometers? Who would be ensuring that the buyers mask up when visiting the market? How crowds can be controlled in the market to comply by social distancing? And how fumigation material could be used?-To translate the trainings into action, UNDP equipped these markets with the required facilities to support compliance among traders and customers. Items to make the three targeted markets safe included: Pedal tanks, soaps, masks, fumigation equipment, and thermometers.-For awareness programmes, communication materials on how to wear a mask and how to make a mask using local material (chitenge) were provided.-In my role coordinating the project, I learned and understood the importance of project communications. Focusing on communications enhanced project outcomes. This was through verifying that the correct information that could be potentially lifesaving (or livelihood saving) regarding COVID-19 was reaching the right people in the right places at the right time.-Through working closely with the communications team and the media consultant, I further enhanced my coordination and my communication experiences.-One of the project objectives is to ensure gender equality and empowerment of women by implementing affirmative action for sustaining women’s economic activities in the selected markets.-For small-scale businesses, most of whom are led by women, the call to stay home results in customers retreating into their homes thereby reducing demand on goods and services that they provide. The reduced interaction with their customers has seen some businesses either completely shutting down or substantially scaling down their operations.-Many of the marketeers are single women and most of them use their income for the everyday running of their households. The pandemic has increased the debt burden on these women and pushed their families to the brink of poverty.-‘’The launch of the safe markets project is an example of efforts to reduce vulnerability to reduce Gender Based Violence (GBV) by addressing the economic disempowerment of women resulting from restrictions around COVID-19. The safe markets will enable women, which are the majority of traders in the market, to continue trading in a way that minimizes or at least the limits the risk of COVID-19.’’ - Her Excellency Ms Anna Maj Hultgard (Ambassador of Sweden to Zambia).-The project targeted 1900 traders 950 of which are women. This targeting is expected to increase participation of women in decision making at local/community level.-Additionally, ensuring gender equality in project targeting contributes to the overarching project outcome of economically empowering those marketeers without formal contracts who may lack social protection, to ensure that their vulnerability is not increased and that their livelihoods are safeguarded.-“Women are hit harder by economic impacts such as those COVID-19 is driving, especially as women disproportionately work in insecure labour,” Mohammad Naciri, the head of UN Women in Asia.-As a young women leader, through my fellowship I was determined to use the COVID-19 pandemic as a chance to challenge harmful gender roles and norms as the crisis disrupts and highlights many of the systemic and structural barriers that have held back the advancement of gender equality.-Through working on the Safe Markets, I am proud of the gender lens applied to this project and of seizing the opportunity to address gender inequalities in hopes of creating a fairer, more equitable society as we move towards the recovery from COVID-19.-As the African Young Women’s Leadership Programme soon comes to an end, I was honoured to have gone through the full journey of design, experimentation, and implementation with the Accelerator Lab.-From being intrigued by the Accelerator Lab’s methodologies to being at the heart of the work, this experience has made me feel like I have come full circle.-Through working with the Accelerator Lab, I learned that home-grown solutions are essential for sustainably mitigating local problems.-I learned that the most innovative, game-changing, scalable, applicable, safe, impactful, and long-term solutions are often the simplest and the cheapest.-I learned that the best solutions for communities come from communities.-Most of all, I learned that we are the innovators we have been waiting for.- ",[],

On top of it, you must scavenge through waste bags with leftover food, used diapers, bottles of various household cleaning agents, plastics and so many other things. You don’t have to imagine anymore. These are the conditions that thousands of Waste Collectors in Lusaka and Ndola endure daily. The Zambia Accelerator Lab (AccLab) team spent a day each with the Waste Collectors in Ndola and Lusaka and our experience was an eye opening one.-During our explorative visits conducted in partnership with the Lusaka City Council (LCC) and Ndola City Council (NCC), we found most of the Waste Collectors without even the basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). These should include Gum Boots, Overalls, Gloves and Masks.-Meeting with Waste Collectors in Ndola-The Ndola based Waste Collectors were working in a non-organized manner. It is difficult to determine who and when someone becomes a Waste Collector. Anyone as long as they can withstand the conditions at the dumpsite, can go and collect whatever they can. We learnt that some of the elderly Waste Collectors use their small grandchildren to collect valuable waste on their behalf. The issue of child labour is one NCC has been grappling with and they have from time to time organized sensitization meetings with the Waste Collectors to try and educate them on the need to stop this vice.- -Scramble for resources-While we were in a meeting, a group of young and energetic men ran towards a truck that was approaching the dumpsite. They had to go and secure the most valuable resources before the truck could get to the dumping area. One of the NCC officials lamented that it’s a daily occurrence and in certain instances it ends in accidents where Waste Collectors fall from the trucks and injure themselves.- -One of the elderly female Waste Collectors indicated that the scramble for resources is what forces them to engage their grandchildren as they are likely to compete with the young men in climbing moving trucks and securing valuables.-We further learnt that there are more challenges that the Waste Collectors face including difficulties in the transportation of their goods from the dumpsite to the recycling companies, enduring insults from those who come drunk and having their collected waste products stolen from them. The key solutions that they proposed that will address some of these challenges were as follows:-1. Form an association that will help to control the access and management of the Ndola dumpsite as well as negotiate prices with the Recyclers.-2. Conduct training that will equip the Waste Collectors with knowledge of grading and the importance of taking clean waste products to the Recyclers.-3. Come up with operating guidelines that will ensure systematic entry into the business and the code of conduct for Waste Collectors when they are at the dumpsite.-4. Partner with like-minded organisations like the UNDP to work with them and the Council to improve the conditions at the dumpsite.-Meeting with Waste Collectors in Lusaka-A visit to Lusaka’s landfill located in Chunga revealed other dynamics that were different from what we found in Ndola. The place that was originally intended to operate as an engineered landfill but over the years it has been reduced to the dumpsite. Most of the equipment does not operate at optimal levels and the waste is just dumped.-The Waste Collectors at Chunga had a systematic way of doing business. First of all, there is someone in charge of all the Waste Collectors and one cannot go into the dumpsite without going through this individual. Thus, the barrier to entry in Waste management in Lusaka is very high. The fight for resources was even more fierce here than in Ndola. We were told that if we did not go with the Council Police, we could have been beaten. But well, even in the presence of the Council police, the Waste Collectors managed to deliberately kick the ball into the face of one the AccLab team members.-The Waste Collectors indicated that they have had formal engagements with Manja Pamodzi, the initiative by Zambian Breweries. Most of them go to sell their waste products to the Manja Pamodzi Aggregators. Their engagement with Manja Pamodzi has provided them with an opportunity to get training and support such as PPEs and provides them with a ready market for the plastic waste products. We learnt that there is a proper hierarchical involvement in the waste value chain. If you are a Waste Collector, you cannot do aggregation and vice versa. There are specific people that do Waste Collection, Aggregation and Recycling.- -One of the main issues that the Waste Collectors as well as the Truck drivers that were delivering the waste indicated was the need for people to separate their waste. They also emphasized the need for people to pay for the waste collection services and to avoid dumping the waste in streams and drainages. They suggested the need to mount educational and awareness campaigns to educate the citizens of Lusaka to separate waste at source so that it is easier for the waste collection companies to transport the waste to the dumpsite and make it easier for the Collectors to sort through waste. The sorted waste will also mean that most of the recyclables could easily be transported to the aggregation points enroute to the recycling companies.-Call to Action-Next time when you are preparing waste to be picked up by the Waste Collection Companies, think about the Waste Collectors. Is the waste you are sending to the dumpsite good enough for someone to go and dip their hands in? You can play your part by;-The AccLab team with the Inclusive Growth Unit at UNDP Zambia Country office through the Waste Management and Youth Project has been providing support to the LCC, NCC and the Waste Collectors to address some of the issues raised during the explorative visits.

It was a challenging year, spent wondering how possible it would be, considering COVID19 and its associated travel restrictions that came with it, to surface an  array of solutions that we knew offered some hope to accelerate the country’s trajectory towards the 2030 Agenda.-Conscious of the daunting task of ensuring no one was left behind, and the need to capture the kind of solutions that would resonate with the needs of the country, the AccLab team ventured out to spread their wings by engaging partners  in the innovation ecosystem.-During the many sensing journeys undertaken over the course of the year, it quickly became clear that there was a wide array of individuals, organisations from government, private sector, CSOs and academia, involved in coming up with innovative solutions to the many challenges faced by Zambians in their daily lives or crippling the economy of the country.-This would take years to identify and catalogue using traditional mapping methods, therefore, to achieve our goal this required a more strategic approach to solutions mapping. The government through the Ministry of Higher Education, offered such an opportunity – the National Technology and Business Centre (NTBC). NTBC is a government agency under the Ministry of Higher Education, mandated to facilitate technology development and utilisation in the country through technology transfer, adoption, innovation promotion and commercialization of innovative products. The Centre has over the years been working with several partners to identify promising innovations.-UNDP signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with  NTBC and a letter of  agreement with the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA). ZICTA among other things, exists to promote research and development and the use of new and appropriate technologies and the manufacture and production of relevant apparatus. With a track record of working with innovations in ICT and business development support, ZICTA brought on board expertise that would prove valuable to the partnership.-The three-organisation team tirelessly worked together to design and implement the National Innovation Initiative (NII) by merging the AccLab learning loop processes with the methodologies that NTBC and ZICTA use in their search for innovations. The NII main objective was to identify and map innovative solutions across 6 out of the 10 provinces in Zambia. The NII started with the innovation scouting plan which saw the setup of an online  call for Innovation that ran from 5th to 21st October 2020. The result was 213 submissions of different innovations that cut across the 17 SDGs. Popularising the Call for Innovations was done, mostly with support from NTBC provincial level partners, radio programmes and social media platforms of all the three organisations, but this was identified as an area that required enhancement to broaden participation from all the districts in the provinces especially in remote areas.-Evaluation Meetings-Following the close of applications, the evaluation committee made up of the AccLab and staff members from both NTBC and ZICTA was constituted to review the 213 submissions. Applications were screened and evaluated based on an Innovation Evaluation Tool that assessed applications based on 5 clear criteria; availability of a prototype/product, commercial viability, technical feasibility, novelty and its ability to have great societal impact. It was worthy to note that community level solutions holders carried the kind of ideas, technology-based start-ups and creative innovations that have potential to solve societal challenges including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.-The 30 top innovations were shortlisted for Lusaka and Copperbelt while all the applicants from Luapula, North Western, Western and Southern provinces that received 21, 20, 16 and 14 applications, respectively were shortlisted for provincial Scouting and training.-The provincial scouting took place between 2nd and 22nd November 2020. The provincial meetings were a 2-day programme to get more insight on the 126 promising innovations through interaction and provision of a platform for the applicants to pitch their innovations.-As a learning point, it was noted that moving forward, more outreach campaigns would be required to ensure a much wider participation from community level innovators especially in remote areas. Mapping of stakeholders at district and provincial levels to widen participation and inclusiveness was on the follow-up actions of the team. In this light, more strategic partnerships would be required to popularise the work of the AccLab and our partners NTBC and ZICTA. One of the online engagements that Acclab has come up with is the continuous engagement through the submission of innovations on AccLab Solutions Atlas. There was also a need to have a process to validate the prototypes by independent people in that sector to enhance the process of the innovation scouting. This raised the need to establish a systemic way of incorporating those that are still at ideation to develop their ideas/ solutions to Market Viable Products and ready for investment to scale. At the end of the 6 provincial missions, 50 applicants were shortlisted to participate in the inaugural National Innovation Fair in Lusaka.-National Innovation Fair-Following the successful selection process, 50 Innovators were shortlisted to take part in the National Innovation Fair (NIF) that took place at Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka from 2nd to 3rd December 2020. An interesting package of innovations were showcased ranging from value additions along the food value chain of locally grown food varieties which included honey, forestry products, agricultural products; production of Energy, electronic and solid waste as well as the use of robotics in agriculture and other sectors. Of interest too were innovations on social models including e-learning, COVID-19 health solutions, financial services and community-led business models.-The theme for the fair was “Accelerating Agenda 2030 through local innovations” The Fair was attended by 114 participants drawn from Government ministries/institutions, private sector, civil society organisations, media and the innovators. The fair attracted several dignitaries, who included the Minister of Higher Education Dr. Eng. Brian Mushimba, as the guest of honour flanked by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary Ms Kayula Siame. Other dignitaries in attendance were the Accelerator Lab funding partners represented by the Italian Ambassador to Zambia Antonio Maggoire. Also, in attendance was the Finnish Ambassador to Zambia Ms. Pirjo Suomela Chowdhury and the heads of the organisations in the partnership namely NTBC Chief Executive Officer Dr. Katundu Kasase and Zambia Information and Communication and Technology Authority was represented by the Acting Director General Mr. Mulenga M. Chisanga.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Orientation,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Zambia,Blog post,Accelerator Labs"

It was unanticipated, happening sooner than expected but driving home the fact that we were indeed on a mission of business unusual. With all the unprecedented issues introduced by the unwelcome onset of COVID-19, we feared our trajectory would be derailed from our focus on the waste management challenge.-As restrictions put in place seemed like we would never be able to complete the Accelerator Lab learning cycle, the new lifestyle imposed by the pandemic introduced a new normal that among others encouraged people to wear masks to protect from and reduce the possibility of spreading the virus to others. Our sensing and exploration that culminated into experimentation that saw us in the physical laboratory and in the field with a few bursts of piloting iterations finally allowed us to understand what it takes to close the Accelerator Lab learning loop.-The guidelines to wear masks created a new challenge of supply versus demand. Frontline workers particularly healthcare personnel directly exposed to the virus were in danger of not having access to the lifesaving medical masks while performing emergency assistance. In addition to the need for the general public to leave medical masks to Healthcare personnel, single use masks utilized by the population would pose a public health and waste management threat. Consequently, the need for alternative protective masks made of other materials also known as nonmedical cloth masks by the general public increasingly became the most suitable option to balance the supply of medical masks to the most at-risk users.-In line with WHO recommendations, which stressed the importance of prioritizing medical masks and respirators for healthcare workers while strongly encouraging countries that issued recommendations for the use of cloth masks by healthy people in the community to conduct research on this critical topic, the Accelerator Lab in April this year working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH), University of Zambia (UNZA) and World Health Organization (WHO) in the country, commissioned a study to test the efficacy of using locally available materials to produce re- usable cloth masks to reduce transmission of the COVID-19. The ultimate objective of the study was to assess whether the use of cloth made masks using local materials would help minimise risk of transmission given that they are a more affordable version for most of the communities in comparison to disposable surgical and medical masks that also pose environmental challenges related to disposal and waste management. The process and learning garnered from this study are covered in our blog Generating evidence during a crisis: Setting standards for re-usable clothe masks in Zambia.-Armed with the evidence from the cloth experiment, the lab explored the question on what the impact of mask design was on protecting the wearer and improving compliance. The next phase involved testing the production modalities in the “test for transition” phase. The pilot phase of production of cloth masks introduced the lab team to four women-led groups of tailors located in Lusaka to support UN activities in relation to Risk Community and Community Engagement (RCCE). The aim of the pilot was to test the productivity and capability of small women entrepreneurs or Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) led by women to fulfil orders of big size within a short period of time of 7 days. The experience was successful with the production of 5,900 cloth masks adhering to the recommendations of the efficacy study.-After the successful implementation of the pilot phase, the team began to search for opportunities for a full scale-up phase to contribute to RCCE activities proposed in the UN COVID-19 Emergency Appeal launched in support to the Government of Zambia (GRZ) COVID-19 Multisectoral Contingency and Response Plan, with the hope that the mass production and distribution of cloth masks will help enforce the government’s call for citizens to comply to the directive to wear masks when in public, and support the supply of the highest quality of cloth masks for the vulnerable in collaboration with UN agencies in country.
-The collaboration with the female led MSMEs brought home the negative impact the pandemic had on the small-scale business compounded by the lockdown imposed on certain sectors of the country’s economy. The UNDP Zambia Country Office, was quick to pick this thread and include the support of the bulk production of cloth masks as serving a double function; one of which would be to alleviate the adverse economic effects of the pandemic through a contribution to economic empowerment of MSMEs led by women. The distribution of the masks during the scale-up phase will use community level government structures, in particular, leveraging the existing Youth Volunteer network from the Ministry of Youth and grassroot NGOs that have extensive collaboration with UN agencies for many years. Thus, without realizing it, what had started as a journey to test the efficacy of cloth masks against COVID-19 scaled deeper into a potential project that would impact the lives of the country’s population disproportionately affected by calamities that come in the face of COVID-19. Tasked with the responsibility to support the design of the scale up of the project, the AccLab team went to work guided by the Deputy Resident Representative.-Project proposed timeline, including the scale-up of activities-It did not take long to have a breakthrough. One of our private sector partners — Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), in its continued support to the national fight against Covid-19, offered the UNDP Zambia Office USD 50,000 to support the provision and distribution of Personal Protective face masks in targeted communities. This is in response to one of the ‘Five Golden Rules’ to ‘Mask-up’ advocated by the Ministry of Health.-Speaking at the presentation of the USD50,000 cheque, SCB Zambia committed to support the fight against COVID-19 and offered its support to the UNDP as a trusted partner. The funds will be used to kick start activities for the scale up project by targeting the production of 40,000 masks through two women led tailoring groups. The masks will be distributed to Vulnerable members of the community including women traders across three targeted provinces.

-The cases of COVID-19 have been spreading and increasing in Zambia. The recent CDC ranking of the country as one of the most vulnerable to be affected by COVID-19 is beginning to become a reality. As at 24th August 2020, 11,148 cumulative cases had been recorded with a fatality rate of 2.5% and a recovery rate of 91.6%. Active cases were 660 recorded across the country with the capital city of Lusaka taking the lead as an epicenter (MoH, daily updates 24/08/2020). The virus continues to escalate despite preventive measures put in place to reduce the spread; which measures include practicing good hygiene (that is hand hygiene and cough etiquette); physical distancing of self from contact with others, contact with contaminated surfaces and avoiding confined public spaces. As well as testing for the virus at scale, contact tracing and immediate quarantine of infected or suspected cases has been enforced.
-The measures were put in place when the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) instituted Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 22 of 2020 as per Presidential address of 25 March 2020. The interventions have seen the closure of schools for non-examination classes, restricting non-essential travels for public workers with a work-from-home policy for nonessential staff operationalized; no public gatherings, closure of some ports of entry into the country, closure of bars and taverns to avoid a complete lockdown,  ensure that essential parts of the economy remain fully functional. With most of the citizens in the informal sector, the move has allowed people to continue with their daily work and avoided the total shutdown of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), especially daily income businesses such as markets and local transport. It is a move that should be sustained at all costs considering that 88.7% of employed Zambians work informally.-Lusaka being the capital city, has the biggest markets housing up to 4,000 traders (LCC, 2020), which are also serviced by bus stations with destination points reaching all the residential areas in the district, surrounding farms and beyond. In view of this, critical preventive measures are a challenge to adhere due to the high volumes of consumers that target marketplaces for affordable foods and other products. Thus, markets are not only a source of livelihoods for some people living in the city but is also a source for social conveniences for many. While the closure of markets was a recommended public health measure to limit the spread of the contagion of COVID-19 in some African countries, for example in Rwanda and Kenya in Mombasa specifically,  the implications of the measure in Zambia would have negative food security and economic impact particularly for SMEs and the self-employed in the informal economy that make up the bulk of the country’s economy. Ultimately, this would also adversely impact the local farmers who depend on town markets and consumers predisposing people to malnutrition and food-insecurity, during a time in which access to healthy, affordable food is greatly needed. Women who are largely represented in the trade of fruits and vegetables would have been further marginalized and affected by the proposed closure of markets. This would have resulted in their economic dis-empowerment and rise in gender gaps in employment.
-Markets have long served to increase food access in low-income areas and support small farmers and local businesses, as well as bolster a strong, locally empowering economy. Like supermarkets, farmers and food markets are deemed “essential businesses,” but concrete guidance on their safe operation during the COVID-19 crisis have not yet been operationalized or standardized within and across cities in the country. Rather than closing the markets in Zambia, adaptation of the markets to public health contexts will yield food security, economic stability, and women’s empowerment.
-In order to ensure business continuity for SMEs based in public areas such as markets, the Accelerator Lab sought to identify issues and possible solutions to improve adhering to public health regulations within markets. By leveraging market traders’ committees and local leadership in the three target markets, the Accelerator lab in partnership with the Lusaka City Council and the Ministry of Health sought for how we could model a Covid Compliant Market by rethinking and adapting existing market models.
-Issues we found:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -The need to protect a large population whose income would be negatively impacted should a complete lockdown be instituted was apparent during the solution mapping process. This calls for sensitizing communities at household level on the importance of adhering to public health regulations to reduce the spread of COVID 19.  This poses another potential problem on how to engage households without increasing the footprint within communities. Following previous evidence on how best to sensitize communities picking on lessons learnt from UNDP Ebola outbreak response in West Africa we found that peer to peer learning works best in a community setting. In the space of the markets, following  an initiative successfully piloted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in some parts of Lusaka,  peer to peer learning would require for existing market structures such as the market ccommittee members to be equipped with the knowledge and tools to operate as a cadre of Market Safety Officers to continually sensitize and enforce adherence to public health regulations against COVID 19 to market traders and customers within the markets. The sensitization efforts will also be complemented by UN-supported Community Youth Volunteers already working within communities to raise awareness on government safety guidelines against the virus.-The need to adhere to hand washing requirement faced a critical challenge in the markets toured. Not only was there need to increase access of multiple hand-washing points but for one community called Lilanda the solution required solving a structural water issue the market was experiencing. The team explored existing semi-automated hand wash points like pedal tanks that were locally produced in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. These were already posing the challenge of sustainability in the face of the high passage of people entering the markets. Fortunately, the Lab was able to identify a local innovator that had designed a fully automated, portable handwashing station with body temperature sensors. Hopes are to collaborate with the innovator to produce a prototype fitted to the needs of each specific market locality.-The challenge posed by the need to comply to donning protective wear raised the question on what type of Protective Personal Equipments (PPEs) would be required to reduce transmissions in the market spaces, based on recommendations from the study conducted in April 2020 by AccLab Zambia in collaboration with University of Zambia, Ministry of Health and WHO on “Assessing the efficacy of homemade masks towards prevention of the spread of COVID-19” of selected cloth materials, the UNDP will support the production of masks for distribution to the at-risk populations working in the markets. For this reason, community sensitizations will include messaging on proper production, use and handling of reusable double layered cotton masks based on guidelines from the study.-Market committees have committed to developing practical measures to support physical distancing within the market places while at the same time allowing for businesses to continue by exploring the possibilities of using alternative free spaces with the guidance of the City Planning Department to decongest current markets. This may also include developing guidelines and monitoring system to allow a certain number of marketeers and customers at a time that will meet the physical distancing measurement requirement. To support attempts in this direction, the Lab is exploring a partnership with a local errand service start-up business to pilot a delivery App that will connect consumers to market traders without the need to visit the markets.-As the AccLab team prepares to implement the Covid Compliant Market model in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Lusaka City Council, the UNDP Gender team and Women for Change , a lot of excitement has been built up surrounding the possibility such a model creates – from ensuring safe spaces are created for traders most of whom are female to the possibility of government developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that will guide the operations of markets in the long term. The learning will reveal what possibility exists in keeping our markets safe from spread of not only COVID-19 but other contagious diseases.-Contact us using the following email address accab.zm@undp.org- ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Accelerator Labs"

-Under this year's theme ""Advancing Equity. Building Resilience, Ending Malaria"", World Malaria Day is an opportunity to remember that we can save lives through the efforts and investments needed to build resilient and sustainable health systems for all.-As a Principal Recipient of the Global Fund in Djibouti, UNDP supports the Ministry of Health in the fight against malaria, AIDS and TB in Djibouti.-On the occasion of the International Malaria Day, Mr. Gaël Ollivier, Acting Representative of UNDP, wished to recall that efforts and investments are needed to build resilient and sustainable health systems. He thanked all of the Global Fund's partner governments for their financial contributions, led by the United States of America and France. These two countries also provide high-level technical assistance programs to facilitate the implementation of Global Fund-financed activities in Djibouti. This funding is essential to ending the malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics.-As part of the National Health Development Plan (PNDS 3rd generation 2020-2024), Djibouti has committed to reducing malaria morbidity by 50% by 2024 compared to 2019 data with the aim of reaching zero indigenous cases by the end of 2030.-Malaria is a major public health problem in Djibouti. In previous years, malaria cases have steadily increased from 14,810 cases in 2017 to 73,535 cases in 2020. However, Djibouti hopes to reverse this overall trend. In 2021, the number of malaria cases decreased by 24% compared to the 2020 situation, with a total of 55,646 cases.
-
-The government of Djibouti, with funding from the Global Fund and other partners, has made progress in its ability to fight malaria by providing the community with combined approaches directed against the transmission vector. These include indoor residual spraying in twelve neighborhoods most affected by malaria in the commune of Boulaos and the destruction of larval habitats. It also involves the mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets in the target neighborhoods, but also for the benefit of children under five years of age, pregnant women through routine services, and migrant populations in Djibouti City and the regions. The Global Fund also supports interventions to strengthen the capacities of health system actors for better diagnosis and management, which is at the heart of the long-term strategy to fight malaria.-In addition, awareness campaigns for social and behavioral change for the adoption of good malaria control practices in secondary schools, universities and community centers.-According to the Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh, Djibouti is on track to meet the targets of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria Control 2016-2030. However, the pace of progress and the appropriateness of control approaches to the epidemiological context must be continued if we hope to join the elimination countries.-The Ministry of Health will need the multisectoral commitment of all, including the mobilization of the Djibouti City Hall, the road system, urban planning, the environment, national education, and communication, to achieve malaria elimination and respond to the motto ""Building Resilience. Ending Malaria"".-The mobilization of all financial and technical partners is a priority. Multisectoral involvement and awareness of each partner in the fight against malaria is the only sustainable solution to eliminate malaria. ",[],

These texts concern the internal regulations of the penitentiary establishments to ensure their good functioning and a better respect of the rights of the detainees, the implementation of a control manual to monitor and improve the conditions of detention, and a general disciplinary regulation to prevent and sanction any failure and any behavior that could undermine the good functioning of the public penitentiary service. In order to enable the prison administration to better fulfill its missions, a proposal for an organizational chart to reorganize the prison administration was also validated.-These instruments were developed on the basis of existing Djiboutian regulations, based on several consultations with actors involved in the penitentiary sector and on the conclusions of the workshop on the normative framework organized on March 1, 2022.-The three draft texts are also inspired by the texts that organize the prison system in other countries with similar institutional, organizational and socio-economic aspects, as well as the main tools for the treatment of detainees at the international level. These include the Mandela Rules applicable to all categories of prisoners, the Bangkok Rules for the specific treatment of women prisoners, and the Beijing Rules for the specific treatment of minors.
-The texts are the result of close collaboration and an in-depth review of the regulatory framework between prison officials, the Ministry of Justice and UNDP in the weeks leading up to the workshop. The whole process benefited from the considerable contribution of an international prison expert made available to the project by the UN Standing Committee of Judicial and Prison Officers (JCSC).

--Djibouti, 27 March 2022 - Under the high patronage of His Excellency the Prime Minister, His Excellency Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed, the Ministry in charge of the Digital Economy and Innovation launched the Digital Economy and Innovation Roadmap to implement key reforms to boost productivity, efficiency and modernize administration to sustain growth, making it broader and more inclusive.-This high-level event brought together members of government, ambassadors, development partners, financial institutions, the private sector and civil society and generated constructive exchanges between stakeholders from across society, notably through active participation in the panel discussion, The event was chaired by the Minister of Digital Economy and Innovation, Her Excellency Mrs Mariam Hamadou Ali, the Minister of Budget, His Excellency Mr Isman Ibrahim Robeh, the Governor of the Central Bank of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr Ahmed Osman Ali, the CEO & Founder Cybersan, Mr Bilal Moussa and the CEO of kikdrop Mr Jean-Pierre Chebat.-Although the business environment in Djibouti has improved considerably in recent years, the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem is still in its infancy and has a long way to go in attracting funding and stimulating the creation of cutting-edge and innovative start-ups. The main barriers to digital entrepreneurship are lack of technical and managerial skills, limited funding, poor telecommunications infrastructure, low broadband penetration, lack of mentors and entrepreneurial support structures, and legal and regulatory pitfalls.
-In this context, the Ministry in charge of the Digital Economy and Innovation, with the support of UNDP, has developed a roadmap for the digital economy and innovation in line with the national vision and strategy-Through its human-centred and participatory approach, the roadmap is based on four main pillars: digital, economic and digital administration, sectors and professions of the future, citizen participation and digital culture and aims to make Djibouti an exceptional place to live, work, do business and flourish.-
-By improving connectivity, financial inclusion, and access to business and public services, technology can play an important role in promoting equal opportunity and ensuring that no one is left behind. Digitization has become an essential lever to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. As digitalization is also a lever of the new UNDP strategic plan, the UNDP representative reiterated the commitment of the UNDP to contribute to the operationalization of the roadmap and to the consideration of digitalization in projects and sectoral initiatives.",[],

-Djibouti - March 22, 2022 - As part of the government's post-covid19 socio-economic recovery programs “Rising Djibouti”, UNDP partnered with the CLE to organize the second edition of the national agri-business fair held for the first time in Djibouti City with the support of USAID and ISDB. This fair aims to stimulate the potential of local agri-business and highlight the productions of the regions. --The agribusiness exhibition 2022 brought together 100 farmers from 36 cooperatives from all regions and 11 Djiboutian agritech companies. Three days full of flavors and unsuspected discoveries through the diversity of agricultural products and many innovative products. --The National Agri-business Exhibition allowed producers from all regions of Djibouti to present their products of vegetable crops such as sweet potatoes, eggplants, peppers and fruit trees such as guavas, lemons, pomegranates etc. but also aloe vera, honey, cheese, stevia, camel milk, tea, spread, incense .... And finally, many innovative agritech ideas, such as hydroponics, digital intelligence system to monitor temperature and humidity inside the greenhouses and natural toothbrushes, which impressed the guests. --This fair was a unique opportunity for regional producers to present their products to the public and to develop commercial relationships with the private sector. Producers from different regions were also able to share best practices and potential collaboration.- -
-UNDP Representative Ms. N'Gouan-Anoh and USAID Director Mr. Lloyd Jackson present at the exhibition were keen to salute the efforts made by these producers and their resilience despite the significant challenges they face.  The exhibitors were particularly honored by the presence and exchanges with His Excellency Mr. Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed, Prime Minister of Djibouti and His Excellency, Mr. Ilyas M Dawaleh, Minister of Economy and Finance in charge of industry and several members of the government.-The national agribusiness exhibition highlighted the potential of local production but also the challenges of sustainable and resilient agriculture to promote market access and improve the livelihoods of local producers. It  also emphasized the fact that farmers and agriculture need to be business-oriented and move beyond subsistence farming. The products are impressive, but farmers need to get a fair price and be in a business dynamic.",[],

-Djibouti, January 24, 2022 - To further involve the media in the fight against climate change and its impacts, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, with the support of UNDP, organized a training for about twenty journalists on environmental concerns as part of the Global Environment Fund (GEF)-funded project on strengthening national capacities to improve decision-making and integration of global environmental obligations.-Given Djibouti's vulnerability to climate change, the media can play a key role in raising citizens' awareness of environmental matters.-Although policy and legal tools have prioritized environmental protection in recent years, its popularization remains crucial to raising awareness and mobilizing the Djiboutian population.-In Djibouti, the government's environmental policy has resulted in recent years in the adoption of laws and institutional tools as well as the ratification of several international conventions including the three major conventions on the environment, namely the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.-However, the degradation of the environment concerns everyone and requires the involvement of the entire population. In this context, about twenty journalists participated in a workshop on the media treatment of the environmental question.  Through this training, the print and broadcast media had the opportunity to meet experts on those topics and strengthen their understanding of global issues and their relevance.-Considering the urgency to act against climate change and its impacts, the involvement of the media can be decisive to promote awareness of the importance of environmental conservation among the population but also to sensitize them to the role that each one can play to stop the degradation of the environment.- ",[],

-Djibouti, March 3, 2022. The Green Generation Association, in collaboration with the UNDP, organized on Thursday, March 3, a workshop of exhibition of ecological sofas made of tires and pallets and ecological bags at the Library and National Archives.-Green Generation Association is an association working in the field of environment, generally in the region of Douda/Damerjog to contribute to sustainable development at the community level. Through these activities, the Association encourages reflection on environmental challenges among Djiboutian youth and involves them in environmental protection actions through waste recycling, reforestation and environmental education.-Faced with the thousands of abandoned tires in Djibouti and the evils of their incineration, Green Generation Association has embarked on the creation of a value chain in the manufacturing of environmentally friendly furniture. Within the framework of the implementation of the Microfinance Program of the Global Environment Facility, the association Green Generation with the support of UNDP has supported about fifteen young women in the manufacture of ecological bags and twenty young people in the creation of furniture from recycled tires.  The initiative consists of collecting used tires from various partners and independent collectors to produce ecological furniture of high quality affordable to all.-This project is based on the intervention strategy of the Small Grants /GEF program in Djibouti within the framework of the reduction of pollutants in correlation with the national priorities of the development of the circular economy. The transformation of waste will indeed allow the reduction of pollutants and improve the living conditions of local populations through the creation of income generating activities.  --The workshop organized on Thursday, March 3 was an opportunity to give certificates to young men and women of the community of Douda/Damerjog who participated in the training on recycling of polluting waste and give them the opportunity to present and sell their first productions. This day also allowed to highlight the social and community actions of the association Green Generation to contribute to sustainable development at the community level.",[],

This workshop gathered different actors, likely to be involved in the issues of social reintegration of prisoners in order to collect their expectations and contributions to organize the issue of social reintegration and in particular vocational training activities for the benefit of female and minor prisoners.-By social reintegration, we mean all the measures envisaged to prepare prisoners, and in particular convicted prisoners, to return to a normal life in society.-This preparation implies several types of activities, namely: socio-cultural and educational activities (social games, cultural activities such as theater, art, sports activities ...) religious and psychological assistance, maintaining links with the outside world, vocational training activities which generally target minors and prisoners with a final sentence, the use of certain measures to adjust the sentence (placement outside, particularly in re-education centers for vocational training, semi-release ...)-The conclusions of this workshop support the efforts of the Ministry of Justice to reorganize and strengthen the social reintegration framework. -Following this workshop, the support project will proceed with the financing of vocational training activities for women and minors in the Gabode prison where the training center has just been rehabilitated and equipped.

-Although the health environment is one of the most challenging for civil society, their participation is more than crucial to put in place effective actions and interventions to ensure that no one is left behind.-The COVID19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the functioning of the overall health system in Djibouti. The public health measures taken have influenced the essential pillars of health system strengthening. In this context of health crisis, UNDP has mobilized additional funding from the Global Fund for the period 2021-2023 to mitigate the impact of COVID19 and to help improve the lives of people and communities affected by HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis.-However, Djibouti deplores the real lack of involvement and collaboration with non-state actors such as civil society organizations, the private sector, and trade unions. Their involvement can be a real lever for change, particularly for carrying out prevention activities as part of the response to COVID-19 and for responding to the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.-Given the lack of information and training of civil society organizations and in order to maximize the impact of the community-based approach, capacity building of civil society and increased collaboration between stakeholders is a priority for the country.-As part of the mapping of civil society organizations in the health sector, UNDP was able to support the Ministry of Health in identifying civil society actors and collecting information on their identity, area of expertise, activities, level of structuring and geographical scope. In addition, this exercise provided a clearer picture of their training and capacity-building needs and helped to propose an integrated strategy for civil society organization interventions.

The project is developed under the UNDP-led multi-country regional programme for Southern Africa titled: Integrated ecosystems and watershed management for climate-resilient agricultural and pastoral systems in Southern Africa.-The proposed project is titled, increasing the resilience of Eswatini’s agropastoral communities through integrated ecosystem and watershed management.  It will focus on the restoration and improved management of degraded ecosystems, rangelands, and croplands within watersheds to maximise future water availability. Its development is at an advanced stage as stakeholders convened on 25 May 2022 to submit their inputs to the draft proposal ahead of its submission to the GCF.-Addressing the stakeholders, UNDP Acting Deputy Resident Representative, Ms. Jane. O. Yeboah said that it is important for Eswatini to produce bankable proposals that will bring much-needed investment to the country.-“We need to build the capacity to access climate finance,” said Ms. Yeboah.-She urged the stakeholders to use the opportunity of developing the proposal to learn and identify skills and data gaps that the country needs to access the GCF Readiness Programme, adding that it is a flexible tool to support developing countries with up to $1 million per country per year for programmes related to institutional capacity building, coordination, policy planning and investment.-“I’d like to make the following appeal to you. We need to work together instead of silos on issues of land management, ecosystem restoration and agropastoral work which will help us address climate change effects. We must also think of how we can build knowledge systems so that we address the data gaps which are critical to inform policy and development. For instance, how do we ascertain the livelihoods that can be impacted by this project, the multiplier effects on agricultural exports and imports or the gaps in the value chain to inform our response,” Ms. Yeboah told the stakeholders.-Speaking at the same event, Ms. Duduzile Nhlengethwa-Masina, the director of Eswatini Meteorological Service which operates under the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, expressed gratitude for the UNDP partnership in implementing the country’s climate action programme.-“This proposal is not only important for climate action but the overall Eswatini economy. EmaSwati are either farming or supporting some farming activity. If agriculture, both livestock and crop production fails, I’m sure emaSwati would be a miserable nation. For us to undertake this work and come up with this project proposal where we can address some of the climate-related challenges in the agro-pastoral area is important,” said Ms. Masina.-She said this proposal is part of the implementation of the revised Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2021, a national climate action plan, whose revision was supported under the UNDP Climate Promise. Ms. Nhlengethwa-Masina was representing the Principal Secretary at the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Ms. Khwangeziwe Mabuza.-This proposed project follows the successful implementation of the Strengthening National Protected Area System (SNPAS) project, which was implemented through a partnership between UNDP and Eswatini National Trust Commission (ENTC) under the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs. With financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to the tune of $29 million, the six-year project helped Eswatini to expand its protected areas system from 4.23% in 2020 to 5.5% in 2021.

We also encourage men to vote for women. Since independence, women  are often used as mobilizers,  cooking and cheering during political engagements. However, since the establishment of  WOBIPC, we have seen some progress towards the inclusion of women in strategic spaces such as political debates and in decision making, a transformation we intend to keep promoting. The Gambia has a total of 962,157 voters, including 545,318 women (56.68%) and 416,839 men (43.32%). The percentage of young (18-35) voters stands at 57.71% (555220), highlighting the importance of these two demographic groups in deciding the outcome of the presidential election. Before the The Gambia 2022 National Assembly elections, we went on a nation-wide tour to sensitize and encourage citizens to vote for women, inform them of its importance and highlighting that women are key actors for development. An increased representation of women in Parliament will contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Moving forward and in collaboration with the IPC and partners, we intend to continue the advocacy during elections and beyond for people to understand the seriousness and value of women leadership. Key decision-making positions in political parties are usually given to men but we are calling out on all party leaders and members as well as CSOs leaders, community leaders and influencers to consider women and give them key leadership positions.

The project is key in delivering justice and preventing the recurrence of human rights violations, and consequently, maintaining sustainable peace in the country as evidenced with the establishment of and support to the TRRC.-The UN Resident Coordinator congratulated the TRRC on its accomplishments towards ensuring investigations and establishment of an impartial historical record of human rights violations and abuses committed during the period of July 1994 to January 2017 and commended the TRRC’s approach in ensuring the process was as inclusive and participatory as possible, to ensure no one is left behind.-The Resident Coordinator also appreciated the government for creating the right environment for the successful implementation of the work of the TRRC and expressed gratitude to OHCHR and UNDP principles, Mr. Andrea Ori and Ms. Aissata De and especially to the Transitional Justice and Human Rights Project staff in The Gambia who worked tirelessly to support the TRRC.-Other partners awarded by the TRRC during the same ceremony included the Institute of Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA), the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and International IDEA.-The TRRC’s final report to the President of The Gambia, including its findings and recommendations is due for submission this month.-For more information and media interviews, contact: Mariam Njai, Communications Analyst, UNDP The Gambia: Tel; +220 3303180, Email: mariam.njai@undp.org-For more information on the TRRC visit: https://www.trrc.gm/- ",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Accountability,Gambia,UN Agencies,UNHCR,Governance and peacebuilding,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Press release,English"

As research-cum-educational establishments, universities have been the citadel of learning, knowledge production and dissemination on improved development programs and practices worldwide. In cognizance of this, on October 12, 2020, UNDP signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the University of The Gambia (UTG) in mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in its academic curricular, research programs and community engagement.-This partnership, which is currently advanced by UNDP Accelerator Lab The Gambia (AcclabGM), equally aims to support the country’s overall reform process in the social, economic, political and security spheres, as embedded in The Gambia’s National Development Plan (NDP 2018-2021). In line with national priorities, the MOU captures five thematic areas:-i)                   SDG tracking:-This aspect of the MOU is necessitated by the fact that substantive qualitative and quantitative research output is crucial for sustainable development planning and practice. Against this backdrop and as a lead research institution in The Gambia, UTG will conduct research to track, monitor, and evaluate the progress of the implementation of the SDGs in The Gambia. This also includes enhancing data and statistics for development within the National Statistical System of The Gambia. Broadly speaking, such research interventions would be invaluable in informing government policy decisions and UNDP programs in the country.-ii)                 Curriculum Development-Under this pillar, the MOU seeks to mainstream the SDGs in the university’s academic curricular as a way of providing familiarity and learning opportunities to students in the areas of sustainable development. In other words, this approach is geared towards preparing young people in becoming progressive development planners, analysts and practitioners. To achieve this goal, the different Schools at UTG will develop curricula on thematic areas of the SDGs as part of classroom lectures/discussions and seminars. Notwithstanding, the SDG curricula will be used to train and enhance the capacities of Gambians and other nationalities domiciled in the country.- -iii)               Case study and research on SDG baseline information-Studies on The Gambia have increasingly revealed the gaps on baseline information in many areas of development – water quality, rural poverty, agriculture etc. This is where UTG will come in and fill that gap on baseline information by conducting case studies and research. Essentially, having such baseline information will enable us to assess progress, identify challenges, and set realistic benchmarks towards attaining the SDGs. This will equally serve as a guide to development stakeholders, partners and donors.- -iv)                SDG Lecture Series-In their quest to reach out to the larger population of The Gambia, UNDP Gambia and UTG will organize various seminars, conferences, and workshops throughout The Gambia informing and educating the Gambian population on the SDGs. Considering the high illiteracy rate in country, especially in rural areas, this sensitization project will particularly target rural people – farmers, women, girls and youths using local languages and methods. This engagement seeks to avail local populations the opportunities to further understand and relate with the SDGs and as well adopt sustainable practices that enhance their daily socio-economic activities.- -v)                  Project Piloting-Considering the AcclabGM project will phase out in 2022 and as part of the gradual phasing out, AcclabGM by extension of UNDP will support and co-host activities with UTG that strengthen its standing as the likely national partner to which UNDP would hand over the Lab framework. This move is in line with the understanding that the nature of project, in terms of research, experimentation and solutions mapping, predominantly aligns with the mandate and interventions of the university.-Notably, in this strategic partnership, each of the nine Schools within UTG will focus on a specific SDG or SDGs that aligns with its mandate to design innovative projects that respond to the pressing development needs of The Gambia. For instance, the School of Arts and Sciences, precisely the Development Studies Unit, will incorporate and focus on SDG 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender Equality) and related Goals in its lecture/seminar series and research programs. While the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences will direct teaching and research on SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) amongst other associated Goals. On the other hand, UNDP will aid in the mobilization of financial resources and as well provide the requisite technical support.-As we are nearing the end of 2020, this partnership has put in motion fascinating projects around girls and women empowerment, implementation of the gender seal, (rural) community development, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), youth entrepreneurship amongst others for implementation in early 2021. The upcoming launching of the Center for Sustainable Development and Policy Studies (CSPS) at UTG is key among these initiatives. CSPS will be home to academic research, public policy evaluation and development and rapid rural development in The Gambia.-Overall, this partnership is shaped by the understanding that local ownership of the SDGs is integral to their success. Moreover, the complex development challenges of our time signal the need for concerted efforts and (new) cooperation from different stakeholders at all fronts (local, national and global) for successful development interventions. Importantly, synergizing international and local initiatives/efforts is imperative towards the realization of the SDGs by 2030. The UNDP-UTG partnership is a move in the right direction!- - - - - ",[],"SDG Deep Dive Series,News,Sustainable development,UNDP,English"

A 3x6 Approach”, supported by the Government of Japan and partially funded by UNDP Guinea-Bissau through the project “Blue Economy as a Catalyst to Green Recovery”. The training is framed within the second phase of an intervention which aims to support livelihood diversification and employment in a neighbourhood heavily affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.-With a view to providing business advice and technical support to entrepreneurs and to guide their choices ensuring viability, 10 facilitators were responsible for addressing business and market-related content. 34-year-old Neuza Nancassa Mendonça was one of them. She holds a degree in Finance and Accounting, and she was trained by ENGIM on Managing and Planning Business Idea. “At the beginning we did a market study in three main sectors: agriculture, fishing, and transport. We worked on the ground with different entrepreneurs to find out how their business were actually working in a real context in Bissau, so during the training we used the examples from them to orientate the trainees and better lead them to their business ideas”, she explains.-Now the training is over and once the businesses are up and running, Neuza and her colleagues will accompany a set of 30 entrepreneurs each. The idea is that beneficiaries such as Laura or Suncar receive guidance and follow-up for the start-up of their micro-enterprises. Like most of the participants in the project, they both are vulnerable people with a complicated personal context for whom the project is providing an opportunity to learn and start from scratch. The profile of young people without a job and without the financial possibility to continue studying before the start of the project is a constant and this is also the case for Laura José Siga. She is 20 years old and lives in Plubá with her older sisters. Her family’s financial situation prevented her from attending university once she finished high school, so her dream of becoming a teacher was temporarily put on hold.

He has a motor impairment that has conditioned his life in a country, Guinea-Bissau, where care for people with disabilities is still an unresolved issue. From his position as Executive Secretary of the Federation of Associations for the Defence and Promotion of the Rights of People with Disabilities in Guinea-Bissau (FADPD/GB), he works on awareness-raising and advocacy to ensure that information about the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that the country signed in 2014 reaches everyone. “Ignorance of the Convention complicates things, because when we talk about rights people are not aware of what we are talking about, so we aim to make visible the problems that people with disabilities are facing”.-According to the Federation’s experience, the family is one of the main barriers. Paula Saad, Director General of Social Inclusion, shares this vision. “Discrimination starts at home when families do not send their children to school. Every contribution is important for the growth of society and disability is just a specific limitation”. This discrimination is even more pronounced in the case of women. “They suffer double discrimination: for being women and for being disabled, so they need to be supported and empowered to be autonomous”, Saido said. And that’s precisely the goal of the project that UNDP Guinea-Bissau is implementing together with the Italian NGO AIFO and with funding from the financial inclusion and blue economy programmes in Cumura, in the Biombo region. This is the second smallest region in the country, behind the Autonomous Sector of Bissau, and 75.4% of its 90,000 inhabitants are considered vulnerable. Trying to activate a sustainable path for the vulnerable women by creating income-generating activities which contribute to their economic independence and financial inclusion is at the heart of the efforts of an intervention that FADPD/GB is also supporting on the ground. “Women with little economic power are so dependent on their husbands that their rights end up being violated. To reduce dependency is to reduce this violation”, said Lázaro Barbosa, President of the organisation.

Such stories can effectively be narrated by the collaborators in the tourism industry; men and women whose passion is to see the Mountain Kingdom welcome footsteps of those from lands in time zones far and wide, and new faces eager to embrace her majestic beauty.  -In response to this inherent longing for a Lesotho that is accessible to the world  UNDP Lesotho Accelerator Lab (AccLab)hosted the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture (MTEC); Lesotho Tourism Development Corporation (LTDC); Lerotholi Polytechnic; Limkokwing University of Creative Technology; the Association of Travel Agents of Lesotho (ATAL); Lesotho Hotels and Hospitality Association (LHHA); Mountain Kingdom Tour Guides Association (MKTGA); Tour Operators Association of Lesotho (TOAL); Lesotho Council for Tourism (LCT); Earth-Lovers Hiking Club and Thaphoha Hiking Club for a two day Collective Intelligence Workshop on the documentation of tourist attraction sites as well as the development of a national photobank. -Aligning with the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP II) through which the Government of Lesotho (Gol) prioritizes tourism as a driver for economic growth in the country, the AccLab is supporting this development goal by capacitating collaborators within an industry which is said to be a pivotal sector for such growth. “We want to make much contribution towards the GDP at the end of the year as the tourism industry.” Stated the Public Relations Officer of LCT, Liteboho Leketa. The aim of the workshop was to gather insights from stakeholders on how tourist attraction sites can be documented; how guidelines on the documentation of tourist attraction sites can be developed; the creation of an information hub for tourism products and services which can be marketed to garner investments; to build relationships and collaborations between diversified action groups which will be capacitated to drive execution of the development of the photo bank; capacitate hiking clubs on the use of media technologies in order to gain good quality pictures and videos for documentation; capacitate and build collaboration between hiking clubs and MTEC in the protection of heritage sites as stipulated in the  Department of Culture policy guidelines. -During the workshop, Mr. Teboho Khoali, AccLab Head of Experimentation informed collaborators that the term “Collective Intelligence” translated to Sesotho means: “ Bohlale ha bo ahele ntloaneng e le ngoe.” Meaning that the Workshop was aimed at collective dialogues to reach solutions which will benefit the Lesotho tourism sector. Highlighting some of their challenges, such as the lack of community awareness about the preservation of heritage sites, the lack of community involvement in the advancement of tourism, limited accessibility to some attraction sites due to poor roads, limited funding to preserve heritage sites and to advertise Lesotho as a travel destination, lack of documentation of Lesotho tourism attractions, silo mentality of stakeholders in the tourism industry, lack of knowledge by stakeholders on how to sustainably use tourist attraction sites and the declining passion and enthusiasm of locals to support the tourism industry.-The AccLab encouraged collaborators to explore the social, cultural, technological and political factors as drivers which share these problems. Some of these include, the unstable political climate in Lesotho which rendered previous solutions to build the tourism industry ineffective; the lack of political will which leads to uninformed decision-making; lack of access to relevant technologies to enable documentation of tourist attraction sites; and the commercialisation of cultural resources to attract tourists which dilutes the authenticity of Lesotho’s heritage and uniqueness. -Exploring solutions which already exist, Collaborators mapped out ways on how these can be enhanced, as well as ways to document tourist attraction sites.  Some of the solutions which were proposed are to drive stakeholder engagements; for locals to work collectively with development partners; adequate allocation of resources; resource mobilization at a local level to drive Lesotho towards a common goal; documentation of tourist attraction sites by conducting surveys, classifying them and developing a database to preserve all the relevant information; and the development of monitoring and evaluation systems. Additionally, the key stakeholders made pledges to collaborate and support each other. “My biggest goal for participating in this workshop is to build collaboration between the government and the private sector so that our collective efforts can assist communities to benefit from the preservation of heritage sites.” Semela Mona, a  Senior Museum Curator in the Department of Culture at the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture-Collaborator Pledges-Limkokwing University of Creative Technology pledged to  offer assistance to LTDC with video productions and the creation of social media content to advertise tourist attraction sites; -***-LTDC pledged to directly engage Tour Operators and Hotels to collaborate with travel influencers who can market Lesotho as a top travel destination; -***-Limkokwing University in partnership with UNDP Lesotho and Lerotholi Polytechnic pledges to offer expertise in creating a Marketing Strategy for LTDC;-***-Earth-Lovers Hiking Club pledged commitment  to the development of the national photobank. “I made a commitment to put down a proposal as a key developer of the national photobank because as Earth-Lovers Hiking Club, we are exposed to beautiful scenery on a daily basis.” Liteboho Leketa, President of Earth-Lovers Hiking Club.-***-While building stakeholder collaborations, especially between the private sector and the government,  the Workshop also boosted the morale of those in the tourism industry by breaking them out of their restrictive silos. It also encouraged them by bringing to their attention that UNDP Lesotho AccLab is solutions driven and will utilise resources to capacitate Basotho in key areas of sustainable economic growth such as the tourism industries. Indeed Lesotho stands to benefit  exponentially from the proper documentation of tourist attraction sites and a well-developed photobank. - -

As a passionate farmer, she heard about the importance of bees in income generation, ecosystem improvement and other health benefits  on the radio, and she decided to venture into beekeeping. She embarked on independent research, and when UNDP Lesotho through Reducing Vulnerability to Climate Change Project in collaboration with the Ministry of Forestry, and World Vision introduced a beekeeping training programme, she used the knowledge gathered as a launchpad into her business. Eager to  learn, ‘m’e ‘Makatleho decided to join the training even though she did not have all the required equipment. Months later after being fully equipped with start-up kits from the programme, facing several challenges such as ant and moth infestations, this businesswoman started turning a profit from her business. Today she makes up to $120.00 on a good month, which goes a long way in supporting her eight and five year old children as well as her husband. With the income from beekeeping her confidence has been increased  as she can now contribute to the family's needs including children's education, food and health. She is now able to reinvest into her business and is also mentoring and encouraging other women and youth to take part in beekeeping and other community developments. As a woman in a male dominated sector, she proclaims that she is confident in her skills. “I was inspired by another female beekeeper, ‘m’e ‘Mamorena, who would open the beehives alone without the help of a man and I realised that I can definitely do this too!” ‘m’e ‘Makatleho Kutoane.  With a business which is helping her provide for her family, this beekeeper further received training on production and marketing organised by the UNDP's Green Value Chains Project, which has enabled her to price, package and brand her products based on competitive market values. She has also been selected as one of the Marketing Agents in her village to work with other farmers to secure formal and informal markets.  “Now I know what the value of my hard work is, and I no longer allow customers to set their own prices. So, I am able to make a good profit.”  said ‘m’e ‘Makatleho confidently. “Today I collaborate with another female beekeeper with the help of ‘m’e ‘Mamorena, who has been doing this much longer than I have.”-The story of this young woman ignites a lingering remembrance of the saying by Brigham Young: “You educate a woman, you educate a generation.” Inspired by her neighbour, ‘m’e ‘Makatleho ventured into unknown territory because she wanted to practice sustainable production systems that are also socially, economically, and environmentally friendly. Help was indeed nearby as UNDP together with its partners empowered her to stand on her own as a young businesswoman who practices farming that preserves and nurtures our environment. This woman is a climate change and ecology ambassador to keep an eye on!-In the wetlands of Semonkong lies a little village called Tšenekeng. Close to the road leading into this quiet community, is the Tšenekeng Botanical Garden which was founded by Mofumahali ‘Makholu Mahao (Chieftess of Tšenekeng) as a call to improve her community. She proudly spoke of the hard work which she and her community put into the collection and nurturing of endangered species  within the garden. Directing us to speak with those who have been supporting this cause for years, she mentioned how delighted she is to see her vision continue even though she is in her old age and unable to tend to the garden anymore. -Tšenekeng Botanical Garden’s mandate is “Baballa Tikoloho ‘Me U Phele”, a call to take care of the environment in order to sustain and preserve one’s own life. The aim is to protect the land from soil erosion and degradation, to do ecological research, grow ecotourism, assist farmers, healers and allow an opportunity for everyone who wants to learn about the indigenous species to visit the Botanical Garden. “Our goal is to multiply the indigenous species we have here, and to ensure that future generations know about them and how they are tied to our heritage.” ‘m’e Thabitha Senone, Chairperson of the Committee of Tšenekeng Botanical Garden. -The ultimate goal is to improve the lives of the community by creating jobs. The Garden has even extended into beekeeping and honey producing, orchard farming and a nursery for the benefit of selling seedlings to make a profit. The Garden has truly been successful as it has been ranked in the top two Botanical Gardens in Lesotho. It has also won the “Mosali oa Mo Afrika” award. These successes have been reached due to support from UNDP through the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) and Serumula Development Association. “We are so grateful for the help you are giving us here at our Botanical Garden. It is because of you that we are still standing when many people have decided to leave.” Mofumahali ‘Makholu Mahao. Future generations of Basotho women can learn how to protect their environment by following the footsteps of these women. Opportunities are being presented by UNDP and her development partners to empower women to be able to withstand future environmental challenges which exacerbate their vulnerability to poverty and abuse. Our future smart UNDP is preserving the future of nations by protecting the nurturers of our homes and land. -

The CO team engagement leveraged on creating a better awareness of the core values, directions of change, the six signature solutions and the three enablers of the strategic plan for better alignment and scale to UNDP Lesotho programming to the strategic plan and the Africa Promise.-The UNDP Strategic Plan calls for a #FutureSmartUNDP which adapts to the ever-changing planet and social, economic and environmental needs of our world. As development changes, UNDP also aims to change its approach to development by ensuring longevity of its programmes which address problems as they evolve, seize opportunities as they come and anticipate the unknown.-Although the Strategic Plan is defined for the period between 2022-2025, UNDP aims is to implement the 3x6x3 approach to the strategy which will guide people and the planet beyond 2025 in establishing solutions that are intergenerational. This combination will help UNDP continue to deliver on what it does best; integrated development solutions driven by country priorities.-UNDP will be accompanying countries towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through country programmes, driven by national development choices, and with poverty eradication at their core, and supporting countries in pursuing the three directions of systemic change:  Structural transformation, leaving no-one behind, Building Resilience interdependently.-Building Resilience is central to the work of the Governance and Peacebuilding Unit (GPU) as conflict prevention, peacebuilding, disaster management and crisis response are crucial. This has been demonstrated in the Security Sector and Justice Sector Reforms Projects through which UNDP is supporting the Government of Lesotho in building the resilience to carry forth adequate security and implement accessible and fair justice during times of political unrest, especially those involving high-ranking political figures. -The Six Signature Solutions are the areas of highest country demand, and where UNDP best supports the United Nations (UN) system by scaling up development to capacitate countries to meet evolving needs.- Poverty and Inequality-Poverty and Inequality focuses on tackling inequality of opportunities by investing in enhanced capabilities which will drive people’s ability to move above the poverty line.  By 2025, UNDP hopes to have assisted 100 million people to escape poverty, marginalisation and exclusion. Scaling up on youth economic empowerment, with a special focus on social entrepreneurship, green jobs, decent jobs and protecting informal workers.-UNDP Lesotho will help to address the multi-dimensional poverty which almost 1million Basotho live under (further worsened during the COVID19 pandemic) through the increase of opportunities for inclusive and sustainable economic growth and improving food security and decent work especially for women and persons living with disabilities. The country office has started addressing these through the implementation of five (5) projects, namely Sustainable and Inclusive Economic Growth, Green Value Chains Project, Plastic and Waste Management, Accelerator Lab and the Sustainability Support for Trade Project.-Governance-Governance focuses on helping countries to address emerging complexities by creating future-proof governance systems through anticipatory approaches and better management of risk.  UNDP Lesotho’s support to the impending national elections serve as an example of the ever-evolving world of development and how UNDP continues to capacitate countries to reach a harmonious and future-proof unity by addressing complexities through enhanced governance systems. Additionally, UNDP Lesotho in partnership with the European Union (EU) are supporting the Government of Lesotho in the National, Justice and Security Sector Reforms Projects so that the impunity of political crimes by high ranking-officials can be put to an end in addition to creating systems which are efficient, accountable and serve ordinary Basotho with fairness and integrity.-Resilience and Environment-Resilience focuses on supporting countries and communities in building resilience to diverse shocks and crises, including conflict, climate change, disaster and epidemics, with Environment focusing on putting nature and the environment at the heart of national economies and planning; helping governments protect, manage and value their natural assets.-UNDP Lesotho has provided supported to the Government of Lesotho to become resilient by mitigating future environmental shocks through the Reducing Vulnerability to Climate Change Project (RVCC), and the Green Value Chains Project (GVC) where communities are capacitated on ways to tackle environmental shocks to protect their arable land, sustain food security in Lesotho and to harness markets in green value chains. UNDP through these projects has capacitated the Ministry of Forestry, Range and Soil Conservation with the adoption of an AutoCAD system which will assist in designing water sources such as dams for the benefit of helping Lesotho to withstand future draughts. Through the Energy and Environment Unit, UNDP Lesotho further supports Lesotho in the renewable and affordable energy initiative through the Sustainable Energy for All Project (SE4All) where UNDP Lesotho is mobilising 20% of the private sector to establish energy centres and mini grids.-Energy-Energy focuses on increasing energy access for those furthest behind and accelerating the transition to renewable energy. UNDP Lesotho aligns with the above two signature solutions as they put nature, environmental preservation and access to energy at the heart of their work with the Government of Lesotho. This has been implemented through the RVCC and the SE4ALL Projects referred to above. The SE4ALL Project also aims to electrify rural Basotho homes through renewable energy sources.-Gender Equality-Gender Equality focuses on confronting the structural obstacles to gender equality and strengthening women’s economic empowerment and leadership. UNDP Lesotho will assist the government of Lesotho to adopt policies which will enhance Gender Equality. A Gender Audit is currently ongoing within all the government ministries to provide baseline information to the extent to which Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE) has been institutionalized in Lesotho’s public sector. UNDP is supporting the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sports and Recreation to strengthen capacities for gender mainstreaming, gender equality and women’s empowerment, in the context of the adopted the Gender and Development Policy (GAD) of Lesotho.-To achieve the UNDP 6 signature solutions, there are three (3) enablers which UNDP will undertake to maximise development impact.-Digitalisation-Will be used to support countries to build inclusive, ethical and sustainable digital societies. Digitalisation has been used as an enabler to assist Lesotho’s digitisation of public services for sustainability through the UNDP AccLab, which has led initiatives such as the Nulistic Expo and Hackathon where they invited young innovators to employ digital solutions to address Lesotho’s problems.-Strategic Innovation-Will be used to empower governments and communities to enhance the performance of entire systems, making them adaptive and resilient. The Strategic Planning Unit projects outlined above reflect strategic innovation as they aim to capacitate Lesotho to enhance performance and make her adaptive and resilient.-Development Financing-Will be used to advocate for partnerships with governments and the private sector to align public and private capital flows with the SDGs and mobilise finance at scale. -This includes the mobilisation of 20% of the private sector to build energy centres and mini grids through the SE4ALL Project which will assist in the acceleration of capacity building of the private sector through Development Financing. Invariably, this leads to Lesotho’s economic structural transformation where a private sector led economy can be achieved.-Communications is a central to the implementation and documentation of the country office efforts towards the implementation of the new strategic plan.  The role of communications is to tell stories which have never been told, give voices to communities and show off the faces of development - the human beings whose lives have changed for the better because of UNDP development initiatives. Communications taps into all the signature solutions, draws links in between them through development of success stories and delivering through digital platforms. It is imperative that messaging is packaged coherently and in alignment with UNDP’s 2022-2025 Strategic Plan, while also driving access to information through comprehensible language and captivating imagery. Ultimately, a #FutureSmartUNDP can be showcased to the world.-The Africa Promise aims to have a look at Africa with a different lens-The Africa Promise shows that Resilience can be achieved through structural transformation. To achieve resilience within the Energy and Environment sector, engaging local governance structures to include within their mandate the governance of natural resources is important. Africa can use its natural resources to finance development initiatives within its own continent, only if those resources are well managed. Additionally, this initiative encourages African countries to use their already existing networks through the regional economic organisations already formed and the new AfCFTA to drive the growth of the private sector, Strategic Innovation and explore options for Development Financing. UNDP Lesotho Projects are aligned with the creation of sustainable jobs which are outlined in the Africa Promise. Simply, the Africa Promise invites African solutions to address her own development challenges.-The Strategic Plan Staff Engagement resulted in a deeper understanding of the applicability of the UNDP 2022-2025 Strategic Plan. The Country Office team was capacitated with a deeper and contextual  understanding of what is required of them and how they will apply the Plan in their work to better enhance their outputs. -READ NOW: https://bit.ly/3o7Qih7-

First arriving in Mohale’s Hoek, Ms. Wabunoha visited Bethesda High school where she met with Headmistress Motšelisi Shata, Mrs ‘Mamusi Sehlabaka and Mr Thabo Makhoalinyane, both Agriculture Teachers at the school. A short walk from the gate into the school yard revealed behind one of the classroom buildings a greenhouse filled with plentiful vegetables, from tomatoes to cabbages and green peppers. The greenhouse was provided to the school by the Reducing Vulnerabilities to Climate Change (RVCC) Project which provided, among other things, skills to local communities on climate smart agriculture for the benefit of food security in Lesotho. Following the RVCC project closure, UNDP Lesotho has continued to support these local communities through the Green Value Chains (GVC) Project which contributes to the national COVID19 recovery agenda by promoting the green economy through value chains, building capacity and resilience in the local agriculture sector, and building sustainable production systems, processing and marketing, the GVC Project is a collaborative project between UNDP, smallholder farmers, the private sector and the Government of Lesotho.-With the produce from the garden, Bethesda High School has been able to provide lunch meals for their students, in addition to selling the excess produce, and using the money to reinvest in their agricultural production. “This year we used some of the money we got last year to buy some of the seedlings here. This helped us to reduce costs when buying food.” Mrs. Shata said. Teachers at the School were given production and marketing training. Mr. Makhoalinyane added “We were taught that one cannot produce before they find a market and see what the seller would want. That helped us a lot.” The school has also been able to garner students’ and parents’ participation in the tending of the garden as a way of subsidising tuition costs for students who could not afford to pay school fees. Thus, building a deeper involvement and interest of parents in their children’s education and school life, in addition to bringing the community together. Bethesda High School collaborates with local farmers whereby they align with each other in the breed of vegetables produced as well as the quality, to be able to meet market needs with the same standard and high volumes of quantity.-Ms. Wabunoha encouraged the school management to utilise the ‘Marakeng application which UNDP developed in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. The application is a platform where farmers can connect with consumers to facilitate sales of their agricultural produce. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security promised that they would train the community on how to use the application so that their products can be bought, and profits made from all excess produce. Indeed, this will allow the income generated from farming to be sustainable and prevent much surplus produce from becoming spoilt.-The UNDP Lesotho RR made her next stop at Mrs. ‘Makatleho Kutoane’s home. This is a 35-year-old wife and mother of two, who is a beekeeper. She embarked on her beekeeping journey after hearing from a radio programme that bees are beneficial for crop production as they are pollinators. Since she was already an avid grower of crops, she decided to attend beekeeping training workshops hosted by UNDP Lesotho through the RVCC Project in collaboration with the Ministry of Forestry and World Vision. In this workshop she was equipped with start-up kits which enabled her to start her business. The GVC project took over after the RVCC Project ended, and through the project ‘M’e ‘Makatleho  received production and marketing training which helped her learn how to grow her business. Today she can turnover $120.00 on a good month. She can contribute to her family’s needs such as food, healthcare and education. “I am able to help my husband out and no longer need to ask for money for everything from him.” said ‘m’e ‘Makatleho. This hardworking woman has now become a Marketing Agent who helps farmers in her village secure formal and informal markets. Making use of all the skills learned from the GVC project to build a sustainable market for beekeeping.-Ms. Wabunoha’s last stop was at a mini-grid site in Sebapala Quthing. Here she met with the chief of Ha ‘Malephane, Ntate Monnafeela Malephane, chairman of Tosing Community Council, Ntate Telang Sekotlo, as well as representatives from the renewable energy service provider, OnePower. Installation of the mini-grids is a collaborative initiative between UNDP, OnePower and the Department of Energy through a Project called ‘Development of Cornerstone Public Policies and Institutional Capacities to Accelerate Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Progress’. The SE4All Project is a renewable energy initiative designed to meet energy needs of rural communities whose access is not possible due to their location and limited government resources. In Sebapala, the initiative will focus on the installation of mini-grid solar panels to supply electricity to about 800 homes. Detailing their excitement and hope for their community, Chief Malephane stated “My community and I are very grateful. We promise to take care of the mini-grids which are going to be installed!” Electrification in this community will bring with it safety for women and girls as most of them will be able to travel when it is dark outside with little fear. Ms. Wabunoha added that school children will now have the opportunity to study until late at night because they will have electricity in their homes as opposed to having to use candlelight. All the stakeholders indicated their satisfaction with progress made thus far. Head of Operations from OnePower, the biggest funder for this project, David Song, indicated his joy that the Project is officially commencing and that Basotho communities can now finally benefit from sustainable energy sources.-These initiatives to preserve our environment while also developing our communities are important in building the Lesotho we want, where people are lifted out of extreme poverty and presented with many opportunities to advance in life. Certainly, UNDP Lesotho continues to pursue the global initiative of #ForPeopleForPlant where we advance the lives of Basotho while also preserving the beautiful Mountain Kingdom in the Sky and its resources. -

The objective of the NGO week was aimed at reviewing lessons learned from the past year with regards to realigning LCN and its members with the mandate of representing the voiceless even during the plight of the COVID19 pandemic, equipping civil society organisations (CSO’s) with renewed strength, common vision and skills, while also addressing many societal woes Lesotho is grappling with such as poverty, post-COVID19 recovery, weak economic growth, ill-performing justice and security sectors and inequalities. UNDP Lesotho has been supporting NGOs with funding, skills development and equipment in their quest for good governance institutions, environmental sustainability initiatives, and sustainable and inclusive economic growth programmes for the citizens of Lesotho. -UNDP Lesotho in collaboration with LCN made use of the NGO week platform to amplify some of the concerns coming from the CSO’s, advocating and lobbying for strategic policy and regulatory changes to enhance protection of rights, broaden governance space for civic actors and reduction of inequality and poverty including a key primary concern of the parliamentary enactment of legislative bill on the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission. To this point Advocate Lebohang Leeu from LCN added:-“We are journeying with the Government of Lesotho and UNDP to see that our country meets the Paris Principles on Human Rights as we noticed the draft Bill of our Human Rights Commission did not meet them in its initial draft. A Human Rights Commission must be inclusive, represent all sectors and be broad. We’re involved in the fast tracking of the adoption into law of revised bill inclusive of all the Paris Principles.”-The LCN with a grant from UNDP Lesotho, utilizing funds from the UN Tripartite Partnership (TPP) Support to Human Rights Institutions, used the occasion of the National NGO week to garner support from Members of Parliament by having a dedicated session with parliamentarians to highlight the anticipated benefits from the passage of the bill into law. The chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Law of the National Assembly provided feedback on progress made to date in reviewing the Omnibus Bill which included provision for the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission and committed to working with CSO’s to ensure passage of the Omnibus Bill and the Human Rights sections in particular, as well as the ongoing Security Sector and the Justice Sector Reforms Processes. This platform was also an opportunity for the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Defence to present on their progress as well as their roadmap towards ensuring the integration of human rights matrices into the justice and sector reforms process.-Other issues of concern were the impending general elections, where the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), provided feedback on their readiness to host and support this democratic exercise, in addition to provision of a report on their capacity and funding challenges. Another matter of concern was poverty and food insecurity in Lesotho, which is being addressed through UNDP Lesotho support to local farmers through the Small Grants Programme (SGP). This was evident through a session at the NGO Week geared towards establishing a forum for narrative labelling of some organic produce through the Rural Self-Help Development Association in collaboration with Slow Food Lesotho with the aim to broaden market access for Lesotho’s farm produce.-UNDP Lesotho continues to urge CSO’s to take a gender-focus in their interventions, especially with rising femicides, homicides and gender-based violence. This was reiterated by the UNDP Lesotho Resident Representative, Ms. Betty Wabunoha, during her closing remarks at the official conclusion of the NGO week. She congratulated the organisers for hosting a session with a gender perspective, “Amplifying Women’s Voices, Leadership and Participation: A unique opportunity to implement the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security in Line with UNSCR 1325 and an African Women Leadership Chapter in Lesotho”, encouraging hope that women’s leadership participation will be woven into many fabrics of social and political formations has truly been ignited.- There is a clear range of roles civil society plays in Lesotho with a human-centric focus on development, from involvement in human rights protections, broad governance processes and economic growth. UNDP Lesotho continues to support civil society, as part of its regional strategy of “Reimagining Governance”, in which civil society’s dominance as one of the central pillars to democratic governance is recognised. Using this approach of ‘public-civic-private sector partnership, will go a long way in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. -

This symbolic event was held in the presence of several personalities including Mrs. Kobita Jugnauth, spouse of the Prime Minister of Mauritius; representatives of several ministries and of the UNDP, and women entrepreneurs.-The UNDP Mauritius Country Office is supporting the Mauritius Renewable Energy Agency (MARENA) in the promotion and development of Renewable Energy (RE) under the Green Climate Fund (GCF) project entitled “Accelerating the transformational shift to a low-carbon economy in the Republic of Mauritius”. This partnership involves collaboration with several ministries and parastatal bodies to ensure a training programme on entrepreneurship and the basics of PV  for women holding micro-enterprises. These training sessions which were also supported by the Clinton Climate Initiative under the Clinton Foundation were launched in October 2020, and have benefited 192 participants (including 175 women and 17 men).-During the event, Mrs. Kobita Jugnauth expressed her gratitude to the UNDP country office “for helping Mauritius to lay the foundations for electricity generation from Renewable Energy at a national scale”. She also mentioned the precious collaboration of the Clinton Foundation, which has allowed to support various local public institutions for raising awareness on RE at grassroots level. Mrs. Kobita Jugnauth also congratulated MARENA for its contribution and highlighted that she was pleased to see that many women entrepreneurs had benefited from training sessions that will allow them to develop further, potentially through the use of RE.-Present during the ceremony, the Honourable Georges Pierre Lesjongard, Minister of Energy and Public Utilities, congratulated the awardees stating that it is “encouraging to see women’s increasing interest in the energy sector, which has, for long, been a male-dominated one”. Minister Lesjongard added that Mauritius is short of many natural resources but is endowed with sunlight, sea, and wind energy, which are solutions for green energy production and for the economy at large. The Honourable Georges Pierre Lesjongard also highlighted that it should be “every Mauritian’s dream that Mauritius becomes greener by producing clean energy”.-The Honourable Kalpana Devi Koonjoo-Shah​, Minister of Gender Equality and Family Welfare​, acknowledged that the contributions of MARENA and the UNDP to drive more women towards Renewable Energy were aligned with the policy of her ministry concerning women empowerment. Minister Koonjoo-Shah also expressed the wish “to see more women engineers in the RE sector.”-“Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”-Ms. Amanda Serumaga, UNDP Resident Representative for Mauritius and Seychelles, congratulated the awardees for their successful completion of the training and highlighted the benefits of an integrated approach to complex development challenges and long-term market demands. The UNDP Resident Representative stressed that “this training enabled working towards SDG 5 on “Gender Equality”; SDG 7 on “Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, focusing on women, youth, and local and marginalised communities; and on SDG 13, “Taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.-Ms. Mreedula Mungra, and Mr. Danen Beemadoo, respectively Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of MARENA, have emphasised the ambition of Mauritius to reach 60% of RE on the energy grid by 2030 and the efforts that this would involve, including installations for an additional 500 MWH.

This workshop was organised under component 1 of the GEF-UNDP Mainstreaming Invasive Alien Species Prevention, Control and Management project, which is implemented by the Ministry of Agro Industry and Food Security through the National Parks and Conservation Service, in collaboration with the UNDP country office.
-Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are living organisms that are introduced from one territory to another through the movement of people and goods. IAS spread into new territories and cause the destruction of native biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems. In Mauritius, where the impacts of IAS also cut across many economic sectors and threaten food security and human health, a coordinated and comprehensive approach is required to control this serious threat.
-The GEF-UNDP Mainstreaming Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Prevention, Control, and Management project aims to safeguard globally significant biodiversity in vulnerable ecosystems through the prevention, control, and management of IAS in the Republic of Mauritius. The main objectives are to build capacities to prevent, control, eradicate or effectively manage IAS; strengthen legislative policy and institutional frameworks to fight IAS; and improve knowledge and increase awareness on the risks posed by IAS and the need for biosecurity.
-The inception workshop provided an overview of the implementation status of the 2010-2019 National Invasive Alien Species Strategy and Action Plan (NIASSAP), and shared the review and update process and how the new NIASSAP recommendations will be mainstreamed in the actual legal framework. The workshop also shared a brief on the methodology and work plan of the consultant recruited by the UNDP to roll out the review, SGS a world-leading inspection, verification, testing, and certification company.- - -Setting a transdisciplinary approach to IAS
-In his opening message to the audience, Mr. Kevin Ruhomaun, National Project Director, Director National Parks and Conservation Service (NPCS) expressed his hopes that the NIASAPP review process would facilitate an exchange of “a maximum of information for the benefit of Mauritius and also serve as an example for the region which comprises many SIDS with biodiversity that is sensitive to IAS.”
-Tanzila Watta Sankoh, UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Programme Management and Support Specialist, mentioned UNDP’s support to the Ministry of Agro-Industry to cope with IAS and stated that “this workshop is an opportunity to gather information from stakeholders and fully participate in the development of this strategy.”-During his presentation of the review process of the NIASSAP, Dr. Guillaume Drillet, Team Leader from SGS, highlighted that the IAS impact is felt across industries and departments and concerns every sector of society, requiring work in a transdisciplinary way. He also said that a consultative and gender-sensitive/responsive process was necessary for this project.-The workshop also provided the opportunity for the team of consultants to engage with the various stakeholders involved in the policy, regulatory and institutional framework, and to take stock of the roles and responsibilities of each relevant institution for the prevention, control and management of IAS.-The revised costed NIASSAP and proposals for amendments regarding the institutional framework, including terms of reference and mandate of the National IAS Coordinating Committee to be created and future Apex Agency, will need to be submitted to the Government of Mauritius by November 2022. This establishes a foundation for specific enabling activities for holistic IAS management for the next 10 years.- ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,In the news,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 14  Life below water,Mauritius,News,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The spirit of resilience is intertwined with every person within the beautiful nation, which despite the devastating power of nature continues to stand tall.- -Gray skies and fields are not normally associated with the tropical environment of the beautiful country of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but a year ago the landscaped transformed dramatically when the La Soufrière Volcano erupted displacing approximately 20,000 people with 30 communities being evacuated. The ash clouds and threat of further devastation still hovers in the recesses of current memory like a bad dream, but the volcano has once again resumed its slumber. However, the impacts of its awakening can still be seen 12 months since the disaster sought to undermine all the gains the country had made towards improving its resilience and promoting sustainable development.-Entire villages were covered in ashes, buildings damaged, schools and businesses closed, crops and livestock destroyed, and residents left with limited access to clean drinking water. But the resilience of the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean would prevail. UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean mobilised US$300 000 from UNDP Core Funding towards the relief efforts as additional funds were raised by other UN partners and support organisations. To date, over 20,000 cubic tonnes have been removed and while there is still additional clean up required, life is returning to normal.-Sustained recovery efforts require substantial financial support and the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) provided USD 416,204.00 (EC$1.1 million) through a partnership with UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean to strengthen recovery efforts in country. This additional resource allowed for Phase 2 to be expanded and more communities to receive assistance. The former UNDP Resident Representative for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, Valerie Cliff and the Spanish Ambassador Fernando Nogales visited St. Vincent on November 21, 2021 to see first-hand the devastation caused by the eruption and to view progress on the ash removal.-During the crisis it was important to play a delicate balancing game. The immediate needs of persons needed to be met but continuous development of the country to regain the ground lost towards the SDGs and local resilience could not be neglected. The government with the support of UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, other UN Partners and developmental agencies responded to the eruption of La Soufrière volcano with a comprehensive 3 pillar recovery strategy. Pillar 1 prioritises the execution of Household and Building Damage Assessments (HBDA) which will allow for data driven and evidence-based   decision-making processes.  While Pillar 2 addresses more immediate needs of cleaning volcanic ash, clearing debris and supporting economic reactivation in the most affected areas  while providing   emergency employment to over 2,000 households directly affected by the volcano eruption.-- -The volcano was not the only disaster that the country was facing, as the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the world with the region feeling the brunt of the effects as tourism industries were crippled and economies crashed. To address the economic impacts while still providing the much-needed Ash removal, UNDP partnered with the Buildings, Roads and General Services Authority (BRAGSA) to roll out a fully functional ash removal programme in June: providing temporary employment to approximately 185 persons (108 men, 77 women).  42% of the workers were women, with specific priority being given to women who headed their households.-It has been a year of recovery and while life has regained some normalcy, the eruption setback development efforts and these gains must be recovered and built upon. To date UNDP continues to support the Government and people of St Vincent and the Grenadines in recovery efforts. Currently, with additional financial support by AECID, Phase 2 advances the emergency employment and ash clean up and expands work to improve access to feeder roads through de-bushing activities and has recently been completed. 2,010 persons (904 women and 1,106 men) who experienced financial hardships due to the volcanic eruption, received short term livelihood support tied to ash and debris removal allowing for the purchase of essential food and household items.  At present, approximately 32KM of roads have been cleared allowing safe access to farms and facilitating the continuance of farmer livelihoods following the volcanic eruption- -As St. Vincent and the Grenadines continues to seek innovative solutions to build resilience and ensure livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with the government and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development and building resilient communities guided by the Blue Economy for Green Islands Approach.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,In the news,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ,News,Success Stories,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

She decided that acquiring a skill was the best way to achieve her goals and learning from her mother, she became a skilled potter specialising in coal pots. As a woman-entrepreneur, she plied her trade to tourists and locals who visited the picturesque Choiseul community renowned for its art and hand-crafted items, especially coal pots!-Raising 6 “big children” and building her own home, a wall structure that serves as both home and workshop, this exuberant lady could not have foreseen that her life would drastically change after a seemingly innocent injury would result in the removal of her leg. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that the overall prevalence of disability will be 9.4% by 2050 due to demographic changes.[1] Within the Caribbean, a high prevalence and increasing annual rate of diabetes in Saint Lucia - 11.6% (2019) has also resulted in associated complications, contributing to a high rate of limb amputation. This is a plight faced by many Saint Lucian’s.-“I couldn’t stay here,” Marie explained her inability to live on her own after the initial amputation, “so I stayed by my aunt and I asked myself what will I do now.” Ever resilient, Marie turned to selling baked nuts and packaging turmeric for sale to support herself as it was difficult to manoeuvre and create her pottery to the scale she had before.-But help would come a few years later in the form of a phone call, when Marie’s eldest daughter called to inform her that she was selected to be a beneficiary of the UNDP-NCPD Prosthethic project.-“One day my daughter called me and told me, ‘eh, I have a story for you, you have to come up to Vieux Fort on Wednesday’ I say for what? [She said] ‘for a leg.’  -Marie admitted that when she first received the news she thought it was a joke, but on realising the truth her excitement was palpable.-“I’m glad so much I couldn’t even sleep that night” she reminisced with the team before detailing the process of receiving her leg which began with an interview and proceeded to the fitting. The team at the prosthetic centre fitted Marie with her leg and then provided a whole day therapy session to allow her to practice with the leg inclusive of practicing walking and ascending and descending stairs.-It has been 3 weeks since Marie received her above the knee prosthesis, a process that included 5 visits before she was able to return to Choisel with her new limb. Now Marie is back on her feet and shares that while she still uses her wheelchair at times, her new limb allows her to be more mobile and she can once again walk in her community, go to town with her daughter and even dance!  -Marie has done so much in her life, she has raised 6 children, built her own home and continues to conduct her livelihood as a craft person and small farmer. A pinnacle of strength, she is still faced with many hurdles that are prohibitive including her socio-economic background, being a member of the crafts industry and a woman with a disability. This intervention provides her with an opportunity that she may not have been able to afford otherwise.-“It is very expensive” she mentioned noting that she asked herself how would she have made the money to afford a prosthesis. She pointed out that a prosthesis could cost almost EC$8000 and she would not have been able to afford that expense. The National Council for and of Persons with Disabilities is the only facility in  Saint Lucia that creates prosthetics, and while subsidized by the Government, the cost is still restrictive for some.-Marie is one of 5 women and 5 men to benefit from this project supported by UNDP and executed by the NCPD. Thanks to this support, Marie is back on her feet and continues to make her coal pots and other pottery!  - - -

This was exactly the purpose of a two-part series of panel discussions coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of the UN joint programme: Building Effective Resilience for Human Security in Caribbean Countries: The Imperative of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in a Strengthened Agriculture Sector. The series delved into the issues highlighted by a UNDP commissioned Gender Responsive Evaluation of the Impact of Structural Adjustment Programmes and Relevant National Policies on Small Holder Farmers, Fisher-folk and Small Business Entrepreneurs study conducted under the joint programme and examined these issues with the parties most impacted – small farmers especially women, and the government ministers and policy makers responsible for “finding solutions”.-The first virtual Panel Discussion, hosted on the UWI TV platform was held on 25 February with farmers and farming NGOs under the theme: The Human Security Approach and Creating a Conducive Environment for the Development of Small Farmers in the Eastern Caribbean. This dialogue focused on small and women farmers, while discussing practical and innovative solutions to address the challenges outlined above, leading to viable livelihoods for small farmers. This session allowed actual farmers to highlight some of the issues they were facing in real time and provide insights into the type of support they needed from a practical standpoint.-But to effect real change, action is needed. Following on its heels, a little over a month later, the second virtual Panel Discussion on UWI TV was hosted on 8 April 2022. This session built on the inputs of the farming community and provided Ministers in the Agriculture, Gender, Finance and Planning sectors, as well as finance partners with an opportunity to discuss policies and strategies being implemented or in the pipeline, that will impact the ability of the small farming sector and specifically women and youth, to have sustainable livelihoods while contributing to the food security of the region.-These panel discussions offered governments a regional platform to discuss the programmes and policies that they are implementing, taking into consideration the needs of the farmers who through this inclusive dialogue are involved in the solution. What is more, other governments and organisations can learn from the best practices shared by the panel. For Example, the Hon. Virginia Poyotte, of Saint Lucia, spoke on the introduction of gender-responsive national budgeting, planning, implementation, & monitoring and evaluation to promote gender equality as a fundamental human right as well as the keystone of a prosperous, modern economy and highlighted her government’s plans.-Minister Marshall of Antigua and Barbuda indicated that her government is going beyond the usual budgetary requirements for agriculture, supporting eating and buying local and being able to trade within the region.  In fact, Minister Marshall indicated that her government intends to surpass the regional target of 25% reduction in imports by 2025-Further to this, while representing Grenada, the Hon. Peter David, discussed the wide and detailed approaches, through a myriad of inclusive consultations, the government of Grenada has taken to address the issue of lack of participation of relevant groups in the agriculture sector. While on the Barbados front, the Hon. Ryan Straughn, spoke on how the Government of Barbados is bolstering the participation of women & youth in agriculture by providing access to land, water, financing & training as well as efforts to transform the sector to build resilience through digitalisation.-As these conversations continue and more persons are invited to the proverbial table, Caribbean countries are on a path to reap a bountiful harvest in the sustainable agricultural arena.","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 13  Climate action,In the news,Goal 15  Life on land,Success Stories,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Now the council has a bird’s eye view of the surroundings which will assist the Kalinago in monitoring their major water catchments (Majini and Concord) and reforestation efforts. The Council is collaborating with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to increase the water levels of these two catchment areas and reduce soil erosion in the community. This essential project will allow greater access to clean water for drinking, farming and basic day-to-day activities and lay the foundations for climate resilience, while the drone will assist in the extensive monitoring required to keep the project on track.-To ensure that the Kalinago Community can benefit from the drone to the fullest, it was essential to provide training for the Council. With the assistance of a representative of the Government of Dominica’s Ministry of Public Works, a series of trainings are being conducted the first of which took place on February 11, 2022. The Kalinago Council headed by Chief Lorenzo Sanford, the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture East Extension team and other key community individuals attended the sessions which had a total of 21 persons in attendance. This session explained drone laws in the Commonwealth of Dominica, educated interested persons on the key features of the drone, pre flights inspections as well as actually flying the drone. There is no better way to learn than through practice and so practice the participants did! The carpark outside the training room was thoroughly “monitored” as several participants tried their hand at drone navigation. The participants are developing the skills that will allow for a more effective, timely and efficient monitoring system that over time will inform conservation efforts.- -The training which was facilitated by the HLCM Group – Geospatial and Agriculture monitoring will continue until the project end date of June 30th, 2022, to enhance necessary skills to monitor reforested areas and the health of the water catchments.-At this time when exogenous threats like COVID-19 are impacting the region, it is vital that developmental efforts are continued to reinforce the need for regional resilience and building forward better. This project is part of the work of UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean in its commitment to promoting economic diversification, job creation and resilience with the ""Blue Economy for Green Islands"" vision. As the Caribbean continues to seek solutions to build resilience and livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with governments and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development throughout the region and building resilient communities that can withstand shocks and crises through targeted projects and programmes. - - -***-UNDP is the leading United Nations organisation fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality and climate change.

Take a trip to Castle Bruce, Dominica, and ask for Celia Seraphine.-Celia has been growing yams commercially for over 20 years. She clears and ploughs the land to ensure sufficient soft dirt to avoid twisting and breaking the yams during harvest. In addition, this allows for proper aeration and drainage of the yam mounds. Yam plants secured from previous harvests are then treated and planted. Stakes are then obtained to support the growing yam plants. Two months later Celia weeds and fertilizes the growing tuber. Within 6 to 8 months the yams are harvested. Celia plants 4 varieties of yam including white, yellow and a small variety called ‘sucoon’, the latter like ‘babaoulay’.-Celia practices crop rotation and although yam is her specialty, she multi-crops to avoid depletion or in her terms, tired land. This technique is also a natural and economical way of pest management. The other plants include toloman, sweet potato, cocoa, ginger, lettuce and other vegetables and cassava. She contributes to community food security as one of the most prolific producers of vegetables and seasonings, at times the sole producer and supplier.  Most of Celia’s vegetable production is conducted under a greenhouse with a steady water supply that is gravity fed by a storage tank on the farm. Her adoption of water harvesting enables her to combat drought periods and ensure a year-round vegetable supply. She also agro-processes cocoa into coco sticks and cassava into farine and cassava bread. Celia is an avid collector of plant seeds. Once she is given a plant, she incorporates concepts of a germ plasm in her production to reproduce the stock, so she never wants that variety in the future.-Like many women in Dominica, most of the land on which Celia farms is leased and this adds to her cost of production. Fortunately, some of the land on which she farms is close to her house, reducing transportation fees and facilitates her housewife and farming roles seamlessly. Earlier on in her farming career Celia considered going deeper into agro-processing but felt the change would be a challenge combined with her family duties. Her oldest child is now a mature adult and the youngest at secondary school.-Celia is very ably supported by her full-time farmer husband who prepares the yam banks to perfection.-Celia has built a reputation of consistent high quality and her yams are so sought after that she rarely experiences glut. In any event the yams can be stored in her shed for up to 4 months after harvest.-What is next for Celia in her farming journey? In preparation for her retirement, armed with understanding the need for value-added products, she plans to broaden her cocoa production and expand her markets.-Celia is advised by Agricultural Extension Officer Hilroy Alfred. She has been a participant in the UNDP’s Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) training through the Strengthening Disaster Management Capacity of Women in the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and the Commonwealth of Dominica.

The tablets will be used for computer-assisted data collection.-In 2016, the Department of Statistics partnered with the Ministry of National Security to implement the CariSECURE Project  The project, called “Strengthening Evidence Based Decision Making for Citizen Security in the Caribbean,” or CariSECURE, aims to improve youth crime and violence policy planning, and decision making by using relevant, reliable, and timely statistics on citizen security.  The project, funded by USAID, adopted an evidence-based approach to policy making and planning for the eradication of youth crime and violence, and promotion of citizens’ safety and security.  Notably, the CariSECURE Project adopted a strategic approach with expert international technical assistance combined with local knowledge and expertise to:-●     Establish standardized data collection and compilation frameworks-●     Adopt the use of advanced Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to enhance the quality of crime statistics-●     Develop technical officers’ technical and analytical skills in the  relevant  government ministries, department and agencies -The Department of Statistics with the Ministry of Sustainable Development is pleased to be part of the CariSECURE Project.  Firstly, the Department is satisfied that it was able to make a considerable contribution to the adoption of statistical methodologies and practices.  And secondly, the Department was able to learn about the nature and scope of the measurement and evaluation of youth crime and violence.   The donated tablets will be used in the data collection process for the upcoming 2021 Population and Housing Census, aiding in the collection of households’ data on crime and violence.  In the medium-term, the Department hopes to support the Ministry of National Security in conducting a Crime and Victimization Survey using these and other similar devices.  It is important to note that the use of such technology- computer assisted personal interviews -  is a significant step forward in improving the quality and timeliness of data collection.  Therefore, less time is spent cleaning and correcting data entry errors, allowing the tabulation of results to be more seamless. -We wish to once again express sincere thanks to USAID for the support of this important and timely initiative in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis- to the benefit of our people.

Least of all the countries of the Caribbean, thousands of miles away from the epicenter of the COVID-19 virus. The idyllic nation of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) know for pristine waters and blockbuster pirate films would soon feel the harsh socio-economic effects of restricted travel, business closures and lockdowns. Like the rest of the region SVG was playing a balancing act with its economy and its health care system as it strived to recover from this global pandemic and then the La Soufrière volcano erupted.-The eruptions of the La Soufrière volcano began on 9 April with several smaller eruptions continuing after the initial explosion, displacing close to 20,000 persons. Entire villages were covered in ashes, buildings damaged, schools and businesses closed, crops and livestock destroyed, and residents left with limited access to clean drinking water. This catastrophic event, which only exacerbated the current tenuous state of the St Vincent and Grenadines could no doubt be considered a stumbling stone, but the resilience of the Caribbean is as steady as it is strong. This event would be used instead as the first block to build forward better. The government with the support of UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, other UN Partners and developmental agencies responded to the eruption of La Soufrière volcano with a comprehensive 3 pillar recovery strategy.-UNDP coordinated the acquisition of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and tools to be used in the removal of volcanic ash from critical areas that allowed the island to start the journey to recovery.  Two weeks after the explosive eruptions and even before the airport reopened, supplies started to arrive on island via the seaport to support the Emergency Employment Programme tied to ash removal which trained teams and dispersed equipment for a May 31st roll out.-In collaboration with the Buildings, Roads and General Services Authority (BRAGSA) the ash removal programmed was fully functional throughout the month of June with two sets of teams working in both the northeast and northwest of the island within the Orange zones: providing temporary employment to approximately 120 persons (65 men, 55 women).  A gender lens was applied to all aspects of the project and the worker-selection process used an inclusive criterion to ensure that not less than 40% of the employees were women, with specific priority being given to women who headed their households. Persons were chosen from the zone in which clean-up was being done, these communities included Georgetown, Langley Park, and Dixon and Spring Village, Troumaca, Rose Hall and Rose Bank. One beneficiary of the programme stated, ""As a single mother I am very grateful to the UNDP and BRAGSA for offering me the opportunity to gain employment under the programme to clean the institutions around Georgetown as there were no other forms of employment due to the eruption of La Soufriere.""-Within a month, the ash removal team had cleaned ten schools (two secondary and eight primary) allowing more than fifteen hundred (1,500) students to return to the classroom. The team also cleaned three churches, a convent, the St. Benedicts home for children and power washed the homes of a number of elderly persons in the surrounding communities who required assistance. Teams removed in excess of 15,000 cubic yards of ash from schools, foot paths and churches in the orange zone to help communities rebuild and recover.- -This 3-pillar recovery strategy which also includes household and building damage assessments restoration and the regeneration of forestry, watersheds and protected areas damaged by the eruption is part of the work of UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean in its commitment to promoting economic diversification, job creation and resilience under a ""Blue Economy for Green Islands"" approach. As St. Vincent and the Grenadines continues to seek innovative solutions to build resilience and ensure livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with the government and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development and building resilient communities that can withstand shocks and crises through targeted projects and programmes.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 5  Gender equality,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,News,Success Stories,Goal 4  Quality education,In the news,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

I am very proud of my role in this process which has been created by CariSECURE, USAID’s Strengthening Evidence Based Decision Making for Citizen Security in the Caribbean project. They refer to me as the Police Records Management Information Systems. I am PRMIS.
-With an advanced analysis system and the ability to connect with regional databases, I will help Police forces automate processes for standardising and disaggregating crime data in CariSECURE’s beneficiary countries and foster data-driven policing. I will be a partner in crime analysis and ensure that my citizen security allies throughout the region can rely on me to provide valid, reliable, and comparable data for citizen security decision making.-It is true that I am still in the developmental stages, but I was built off the shoulders of the Police Incident Form (PIF), and several training sessions with regional readiness managers are being conducted to make the transition seamless. Lots of different people have interacted with me towards the goal of making me better and the prognosis looks good. The developers are still making modifications and have been receiving positive feedback from those interacting with me. But apart from the glowing reviews, these trials are providing me and my team with real feedback that can help me to perform better when I roll out across regional police stations. One user let me know that it may be a good idea to increase the file size for uploading documents and pictures. This was a fantastic catch and with these types of adjustments I can be even more responsive to the needs of my crime prevention colleagues.-And I can sense their enthusiasm, it has been a long journey and they have offered a lot of insights. I was an idea for a long while, but I am more than an idea now and being able to engage with them in a hands-on arena is a great opportunity. When people remark that I “am quite intuitive” and speak to my usability, I can’t help but feel proud. I know we still must spot all the bugs and work through them, but this testing phase is filled with promise!-It’s so important to get this stage right for me, because I know that with the right data, I can do so much good in the Caribbean. I can spot trends that may have been overlooked before and I can capture accurate data on gender-based violence. Having these types of hard facts can help policy makers and decision makers design solutions that address some of these core issues.-It is an honour to be a part of the solution and the first step in the future of crime analysis. I expect that as the programme endures, I will continue to evolve and there will be many iterations to follow but for now I am the future of Caribbean Crime Analysis; I am PRMIS.

With more than 100 million people and a GDP growth rate of 5.6 percent, the country’s energy demand is ever-increasing. To help meet demand while transitioning towards a sustainable, resilient energy system, over the past decade, Egypt has embarked on an ambitious energy policy reform programme, including a set target to have 40% of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2035.-As part of this, the country is transforming its energy market by investing in energy efficiency that has reduced significantly the sharp spike in electricity demand, diversifying its energy mix by investing more in alternative renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy. Both sources offer safer and more pleasant environments for the cities.-For instance, with UNDP’s support, the government of Egypt has supported a pivotal shift in the country’s lighting market by enabling an uptake in energy-efficient lighting systems, with more than 200 million LED bulbs sold in Egypt since 2015. This has led to a decrease in lighting-related energy consumption for both individual households and businesses.-The government has also heavily invested in various forms of solar power – both large and small scale. Sunlight is abundant all over Egypt, particularly in the South, and Egypt already hosts Benban, one of the largest solar parks in the world in the Aswan Governorate.-In parallel, the market for small-scale solar solutions is constantly increasing. UNDP is supporting the government to ensure it has in place the policies and regulations that enable the investments needed to meet this demand.-Through the award-winning ‘Egypt-PV’ project, UNDP and the government aim to remove the barriers to increase power generation by small, decentralized, grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems, on easily replicable and scalable system design, implemented by households and small- and medium-sized businesses. It also paves the way towards easier implementation of solar PV projects of installed capacity 4MWp to offset 0.6 million tons of CO2equ by 2034.-For homeowners or businesses, solar panels are a practical investment which helps them reduce their electricity bills while having reliable power.-Samar, an Egyptian entrepreneur, used solar power to make her eco-farm project come true. For her farm to be green, she knew it had to run on clean energy. After comparing the costs of solar power compared to usual diesel generators, she realized it was also the choice that made the most economic sense.-“I had a dream of having my own business. And this dream is coming true. When I started my project, I was worried that solar panels would need maintenance and cost more. My perception completely changed when I learned more about the technology and the return on investment over the year. I am able to supply the farm with clean energy through solar panels that costs less than the cost of regular generators”, said Samar.","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Climate change,Egypt,News,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Success Stories"

And this socio-economic vulnerability has been rendered even made worse over the past two years by fluctuations in the local and global markets due to the pandemic.-The UNDP Accelerator Lab team in Egypt have been talking with smallholders on the ground to explore innovative solutions to help farmers gain greater stability and improve their incomes while at the same time adopting more sustainable practices.-Worldwide, development agencies and experts are also looking into ways of integrating small-scale farmers into global and domestic markets and of including smallholders in the development process.-This is because increasing farmers’ participation in markets would expand their choices and enable them to make more informed and free decisions on how and what to produce and how to invest in their farms, their families and themselves.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 1  No poverty,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Egypt,Yomna Mohamed,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs"

The visit took place at the Association’s office at Omal Misr Company (OMC) in the 6th of October district, Giza governorate.-This visit was held within the framework of the ‘Innovative Solutions to Improve Livelihoods in Host Communities of Syrian Refugees’ project, signed in 2020, a partnership between MSMEDA and UNDP, and funded by the Government of Japan (GoJ). The project is implemented within the framework of Egypt’s Chapter under the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan 2019-2020 in response to the Syria crisis (3RP).-This comes as part of the Government of Japan’s notable ongoing efforts with multiple UN agencies, including UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP), and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), towards the “Leaving No One Behind” commitment, through funding projects ―nearly $2.5 million―targeting the vulnerable communities such as migrants, refugees, women, and children, by providing capacity-building for healthcare services and fostering community engagement, in addition to nutrition support to the most vulnerable refugees such as women in pregnancy/lactation periods and their children, and delivering psycho-social support to vulnerable migrants.-This project aims to address the urgent needs of host communities through partnering with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and NGOs in Alexandria, Giza, and Qalyubia ―three governorates with the highest concentration of Syrian refugees―to foster social cohesion and stability, reduce poverty, and unemployment, and improve social services, in impoverished communities. It is worth noting that Egypt remains a destination and transit country for refugees and asylum-seekers, with over 259,292 registered refugees and asylum-seekers, and half of them are Syrians according to the latest UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) data.-With the Government of Japan’s support, the project has thus far secured 62,437 workdays for 530 young men and women in five impacted host communities in these three governorates through the community development cash for work component. The project is currently working towards its wider vision of creating at least 100,000 workdays for 500 young men and women in 5 impacted host communities, which it aims to fulfill by the end of the year, signifying the end of the project-Eng. Medhat Massoud, Head of the Human and Community Development Central Sector within MSMEDA stated that the project is “designed to be implemented in partnership with CSOs and NGOs, in the three targeted governorates, and will produce short-term employment opportunities for 100,000 persons/day for the cash for work programmes and create 320 decent permanent job opportunities in training for employment programmes”. He also added that “the project and all programmes implemented and managed by MSMEDA are fully aligned with both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the country’s strategy and its 2030 vision”.-The Association has partnered with OMC, a private-owned company specialized in managing and operating production lines in factories, that facilitates both technical and vocational training for beneficiaries, and hence their employment at well-established factories. To date, the Association has trained 90 beneficiaries on soft and life skills training, while 150 beneficiaries received training on smart digital meters, detergents, and disinfectants production lines sectors, and sewing and ready-made clothing industry sector, and 60 beneficiaries have secured employment, so far.-Sylvain Merlen, UNDP Egypt Deputy Resident Representative, asserted that “the skills provided through these projects are simple but targeted. They fit what employers need for the growing export-driven industries of Egypt and have resulted in a very good job placement rate. They also convinced trainees to invest time in building their skills for stable income and growth perspective.”-During the field visit, MSMEDA and UNDP officials met with multiple beneficiaries who secured employment, through the NGOs’ training programmes, at multinational companies and factories. Osman Tag El-Din, a young beneficiary currently employed at Henkel Factory, identified the programme’s strengths and opportunities by affirming that “working in a good environment and workplace adds to one’s skill set and broadens one’s horizons”. Mr. Tag El-Din continued, “I have gained a lot of experience and learned several new skills through this work opportunity that will indefinitely live with me in any future endeavors”. Mr. Tag El-Din was subject to the full training cycle specifically organized for beneficiaries that include the carefully planned basic skills training, as well as the vocational training.-Furthermore, visiting Smart Meters Factory, a ready-made garments factory, specialized in the production of surgical clothing and utilities, through which beneficiaries were provided employment, further accentuated the intricacies of the vocational training. Beneficiaries undergo five days of life-skills training followed by 20 days of extensive vocational training before proceeding with the actual manufacturing process. -Nevertheless, as seen from the above experiences of the graduates of the training programs, the ultimate goal is to facilitate the beneficiaries to transition into more sustainable employment following their graduation, which will benefit them in the long run, even when the project comes to an end.

A life relying only on oil, coal, and gas to produce the energy needed to power our transportation, offices, schools, institutions, and households. The more we burn fossil fuels, the more we release harmful greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures, and climate change.-As this never-ending cycle of burning fossil fuels for energy and the global warming of our planet continues, sea levels are also rising. Extreme weather conditions become more frequent, unpredictable, and intense, posing risks on human lives, property, and livelihoods, affecting food production and security, animal ecosystems, and biodiversity. Our air is increasingly toxic, leading to a rise in breathing issues and making us more vulnerable to other health issues-The issues linked to the burning of fossil fuels are further compounded by the fact that they are not infinite. Once these resources are used up, they cannot be replaced. Approximately 80% of the total amount of global energy generated worldwide each year comes from non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels. So, what happens when fossil fuels run out?-Imagine life on Earth without the electricity that powers our hospitals, schools, and factories. We wouldn’t be able to get to work, cook or heat our houses.-Now imagine life on Earth powered 100% by renewable energy resources, such as solar energy. Provided by the sun, solar energy is a renewable source of clean energy that is entirely sustainable. Solar energy systems and power plants do not release any greenhouse or harmful gases into the environment, slowing down climate change, decreasing habitat loss, air, and water pollution. Because the sun is an abundant source of energy, we will not be running out anytime soon.   -This third scenario is possible.-Our solar energy project “Egypt PV” is betting on it. The project aims to accelerating Egypt’s transition to clean energy and a sustainable future by developing grid-connected small scale photovoltaic systems. Implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Egypt, in partnership with the Industrial Modernization Center (IMC) and funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), “Egypt-PV” works to remove the barriers to increased power generation by small, decentralized, grid-connected PV systems implemented by households and small- and medium-sized enterprises. The project’s strategy builds on the planned Government initiatives to develop a market for small, decentralized renewable energy power generation by ensuring adequate returns on targeted private sector investments.-This project has led so far to the installation of 129 solar PV plants, with number of beneficiaries expected to reach 10,000 person per year according to the World Bank’s Electric power consumption (kWh per capita), in 15 governorates with a total capacity of 11 MWp and a total saving of electricity estimated at 16.5 GWh/year. It includes 21 PV plants in the industrial sector, 8 in the commercial sector, 8 in the public buildings sector, 7 in the tourism sector, 5 in the educational services sector and 75 PV plants in the residential sector. In November 2020, Egypt PV was awarded the best project internationally in the “Low Carbon” category of the 21st British Energy Institute’ annual competition “EI Awards” for 2020.-Solar Energy: A Bright Future in Egypt-Egypt is considered a “sunbelt” country. Most days, the sun is shining bright for up to 11 hours. Switching to solar energy can also help meet Egypt’s growing electricity demand in a climate-friendly way while helping people reduce their energy costs:-Tapping into this potential can be a game-changer for the country, its people, and the planet.

COVID-19 has added to existing inequalities and created new ones, hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest. So, what will the ‘new normal’ look like?-The UNDP Egypt Innovation for Development Lab (I4D) took on the challenge of rationalizing the new normal through an internal foresight exercise for the office. Our objective was to understand better how the work environment inside and outside the office will change as we slowly begin returning to the office.-We wanted to gather insights and anticipate the new norm of UNDP Egypt post-COVID-19.  We looked into issues such as: how to respond to new global and national priorities emerging from COVID-19, how UNDP Egypt should integrate the digital transformation, and how to improve the overall working environment at UNDP Egypt.-As a first step, we had an all-staff sensemaking workshop to map the status quo, the challenges we faced, and continue to face as a result of COVID-19 work modalities, coping techniques with the new norm, and potential best practices that can be adopted.-UNDP Egypt colleagues agreed that the Novel Coronavirus brought with it both threats and opportunities (see Figure 1). They observed that communities globally and locally had shown resilience. For example, service providers are switching to digital transactions, which can be more comfortable for some but marginalizing for others.-We mustn’t sit back and let this avalanche of change happen. We can’t let devastation settle on people already struggling with poverty, unemployment, the effects of climate change, and other problems. We must ensure that the virus does not reverse the progress the country has achieved as a result of the recent reforms nor the achievements of our programme. Instead, we need to advocate for a national dialogue about the future we want post-pandemic and how we can work together to secure it.-The information gathered in the exercise was categorized into challenges and opportunities in: a) Programming and Resource Mobilization; b) Digitalization; c) Field Work; d) Workflow.-As a result, we could identify opportunities that are worth developing. New funding windows emerged, giving room for innovation and reorientation of existing and new projects. The project managers identified a need for including innovation in the design of every new and existing project. Digital transformation and new digital tools appeared necessary for businesses to continue operating and exploring new markets. Subsequently, strengthening internal communication also meant increased productivity and interagency collaboration promised more comprehensive approaches for addressing emerging challenges.-The foresight anticipated that some changes would ease once the virus is controlled, such as wearing a mask at all times and physical distancing, while other changes will last longer and maybe even forever. For example, many businesses, including ours, might shift to telecommuting as the new normal and thus impact social dynamics within the office and with clients.-To make sense of the information gathered during the sensemaking workshop, a follow-up futures wheel workshop will start building the scenarios and understand their direct and indirect implications on the UNDP Egypt office and its partners.",[],"Innovation,Coronavirus COVID-19,Egypt,Development Effectiveness,Success Stories"

However, they also have to deal with many other topics and issues that require an understanding of the social, legal, science and economic aspects. -The fact is, they cannot be experts on everything although they are expected to have a view and reflect such views on almost any subject. Over time, the importance of using concrete evidence to support policy debate and making more informed decision is gaining ground. Parliamentarians, therefore, need access to knowledge products to effectively perform their duties. -Member of the House of Peoples’ Representatives (HoPR), one of the key Federal democratic institutions in Ethiopia, is no different. The House is the highest federal authority, as indicated in Art. 54 (3) of the Ethiopian Constitution and is supported both technically and administratively by a secretariat established as an independent office under Proclamation number 1164/19.  -However, as in many democracies globally, Parliament, including its secretariat assigned to support the elected representatives, are not always very well equipped and resourced technically to provide information that helps MPs to discharge their key lawmaking, oversight and representative roles and scrutinize Government policy, debate pressing issues, and pass laws.-In Ethiopia, less than 5% of research requests coming from the Parliament’s standing committees or MPs were dealt with by the secretariat. The remainder of the requests could not be addressed due to the secretariat’s limited technical and human resource capacity. -In comparison, the UK's House of Commons research wing dealt with some 30,000-research request/enquiries from committees/or individual MPs in 2018. -In Ethiopia things are changing for the better, thanks to the support from UNDP through the Governance Democratic and Participation Programme (GDPP) that helped support the establishment of a Parliamentary Research Network (PRN) in 2019. -This network brings together local think-tanks, universities, international organizations, and CSOs, all of whom can help to provide useful research and information to support the work of the Parliament. It is also a great way to supplement the Parliament's staff resources and to foster opportunities for increased civic participation in the legislative body. It fills the gap between what Parliamentarians know and what they need to know. -As Hon. Speaker Tagesse Chaffo noted the significance and key role performed by the network, ‘the House is undergoing reform that the Network would have paramount importance in contributing to enhance evidence-based decision-making process that ultimately increases the quality of discharging its core mandates of legislative, oversight and representation functions’.-Currently, the Parliamentary Secretariat has identified research requests from the Standing Committees that can be undertaken with the assistance of the Network members, who have already chosen their key thematic areas relative to their field of expertise to jointly carry-out the selected research assignments.-Following this new innovative approach to Parliamentary research services provision, the Standing Committees and Parliamentarians will soon have access to evidence-based research reports that will help provide information to the Standing Committee discussions, inform the deliberations when reviewing draft legislation and lead to better-informed decision making. It will also help to enhance Parliaments ability to provide oversight/scrutiny creating a better understanding of the real issues. -There is also a benefit to the other key role performed by any Parliamentarian – representation that requires MPs to know and understand a range of topics and being able to present them to their constituents and seek feedback to help inform the law-making process. This, in turn, helps to ensure that there is a people-centered law-making in Ethiopia. -GDPP is UNDP’s flagship program with financial support from Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Norway under a strategic partnership approach.","['Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Parliamentary development,Rule of law,partnerships,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Governance and peacebuilding,Success Stories,Ethiopia,blog series,Political participation,Public administration reform,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

As most women and girls in the region, Asha married at 16 and did not have a chance to go to school.-That’s why she sees her children’s education as primordial:-“I want all my children to learn. I feel bad about myself because I did not go to school. If you do not learn now, you will not survive. Learning can get you out of poverty.”-Living that close to the border means that Kenyan children go to Ethiopian schools and vice-versa. Asha’s 11 children attended primary school in Kenya before returning to Ethiopia for their secondary education. Two of her sons are now studying in Addis Ababa.-Most of the house’s and family’s responsibilities fall on Asha’s shoulders. But, even though the family owns farmlands, Asha is only able to grow crops once every 3 to 4 years because of the ongoing drought in the region.-So, to make a living, she travels 200 km every Sunday to a market where livestock is sold at cheaper prices, buys as many cows as she can afford and resells them at a profit in the Kenyan side of Moyale.-“The money that we make is not that much, it is just enough to feed the kids. Sometimes when I go to the cow market, I don’t even get to buy any of them. The profit is not big but every month I can get about 3000 Ethiopian Birr” (US$100)-Asha’s situation resembles that of most women in the region: They tend to work more than men, and carry greater responsibilities in taking care of the children and their household, which brings them to show greater solidarity towards each other.-With the support from the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), and together with Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UNDP cross-border programme aims to help those hard-working women become more self-sustaining.-Launched in February 2018, the initiative has created awareness and promoted cross-border trade opportunities for women, such as the One Stop Border Post, allowing free movement of livestock and persons across the border. Since women are for the most part the ones engaged in informal cross-border trade, they are expected to benefit from such opportunities.-For Asha, lack of jobs and political instability are the biggest problems in the region.-“If there is peace, there is no problem at the border. But when there is conflict, there is no way to go there [Kenya] and people don’t come here in Moyale to buy.”-""Women play important roles in peacebuilding and are essential to creating long-term, sustainable peace. We have seen many examples of how women’s peace initiatives have transcended the boundaries of nationality, religion, class, and socioeconomic background in their work for peace. Empowering women in cross border areas has also had a positive multiplier effect on poverty reduction, economic growth, government revenues and employment creation, among other factors."" noted Erik Harbers, Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation to Ethiopia.-""Investment in peace is a critical piece of the durable solutions puzzle for turning cross borders from fragile areas into a ‘hotbed’ of opportunities. Our current strategy – focusing on local institutions - integrates technical expertise to plan, manage and deliver, as well as the ‘soft’ skills that promote dialogue, trust and consensus-building, with an eye on the end-game: resolve conflict and promote peace."" noted Cleophas Torori, UNDP's Deputy Representative for programme in Ethiopia.-The Project is coordinated by the UNDP Regional Service Centre for Africa (RSCA) and is implemented in partnership with UNDP Country Offices of Ethiopia and Kenya, IGAD and UNEP with funding from the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF).

Vegetable cultivation presumably supports livelihood primarily through food provision, income generation, and employment because vegetables are preferred cash crops. Integrated Landscape Management to enhance Food Security and Ecosystem Resilience project deliberately focused on the engagement of smallholder farmers particularly women in the production of vegetable and fruit as well as poultry in their homesteads. However, Innovative farmers like Ferdahusa are envisioning to greater livelihood standards.-Ferdahusa is a farmer residing in a small village called Degahale of Gursum woreda of Somali regional state in Ethiopia. She is around 35 old and a mother of three children and has the responsibility of taking care of four other dependents including her old mother and younger sisters. She is among the Integrated Landscape Management and Food Security project beneficiaries. -Ferdahusa has no farmland and her livelihood was dependent on the sale of local tea and coffee to the local community in that small village. The village is inside the Fafen river valley where the groundwater easily available with shallow depth. As a result, some investors are engaged in the production of fruits, particularly orange.-Before the the project came to her area, Ferdahusa’s income was very low and she used to depend on the sale of tea and coffee using local roasting method using charcoal for energy. Her total asset capital was estimated at 3000 ETB and she was living in a rented house. The income from tea and coffee was not sufficient enough to feed her family and she was explorating for alternative income generation options when the project came onboard. One of the major components of the project is to put in place a gender-based socioeconomic strategies to support female-headed households.-Ferdahusa had started to participate in the community gender team so as soon as she understood the focus of the project, she thought about engaging in the production of small agricultural activities including vegetable, fruit and poultry production. She first rented 0.5 ha of farmland in Fafen river valley and started her farm business through the production of onion on this half acre. Recognizing her commitment, the project staff started providing technical and input support. The major support from the project was through input including solar water pump and tomato and onion seed. After the sixth month, she rented additional farmland and boosted vegetable product.-Changes in the livelihoods of Ferdahusa and her family-Currently, Ferdahusa’s income improved dramatically. Yield per hectare increased and production diversified. For instance, in the year 2019, she harvested more than 500 quintals of onion as the result of increased productivity and additional land rent. Her diversified agricultural products include onion, tomato, mango and papaya. These days, Ferdahusa has constructed a new residential house estimated as ETB 830,000 and vegetable seed distribution shop. She also has more than ETB 900,000 in her bank saving account. Ferdahusa is very hardworking, innovative and fast adopting new technologies. She readily shares her knowledge and skills with her fellow farmers. A significant number of other female farmers have also started to engage in vegetable and fruit production. Ferdahusa is brave enough in understanding the opportunity came to the area regarding the increase in seed demand and she started to become seed supplier for the area and built seed distribution shop. Furthermore, she expanded her tea and coffee business through the engagement of her family members.-Ferdahusa’ future business plan -Ferdahusa is far-sighted and thoughtful and has a plan to increase her income by adding the value of vegetable and fruits. She started distribution of vegetable seed in her newly constructed shop and she planned to sale papaya raw fruit in her shop and juice in her tea and coffee selling cafeteria. Ferdahusa also has a long-term plan to engage in a poultry farm.-* For more information on this project contact wubua.mekonnen@undp.org","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Africa,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Success Stories,English,Ethiopia"

The municipality has acknowledged the substantive work done by the project to reduce flooding and hence agreed to pay 500,000 ETB to the CBOs as a payment for Ecosystem Conservation scheme (PES).-The conservation work of the project was commended by the vice mayor of Arbaminch town, Ato Mado Mengesha, who said, “The municipality has witnessed a significant change since the implementation of the conservation interventions for flood mitigation through the Community Based Organizations CBOs”. He added, the project hugely decreased the amount of damage caused by flood which has been affecting the town and displacing people. The flood emergency response cost almost went down to zero from previously recorded average of 2.4 million ETB per flood incidence during the rainy season.-Adanch’s  family was one of the survivors of the flood that affected the residents of Arbaminch. Her 70-year-old aunt’s house was destroyed by the flood though her life was spared with the intervention of community members who also helped to save her sister.  Adanech said she was  lucky to find her family alive.-However, after the intervention of the Mainstreaming Incentive for Biodiversity Conservations project, Adanch and her family are now enjoying a worry free sleep in the rainy seasons.

The UN system in Ghana has a long track record of effective coordination of humanitarian operations in response to natural disasters and other emergencies such as cholera outbreak or influx of refugees. The UNDP with support from the Government of Japan, and its national partners endeavor to establish appropriate adaptation and mitigation options to work effectively towards sustainable development. Key partners in these efforts include the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet). It is essential that these institutions, and society as a whole, grasp the issue of long-term planning to mitigate the impacts of climate change and prevent the occurrence of disasters.-In 2007, floods affected more than 300,000 people in the country and required more than $25 million for emergency response, and more than $130 million worth of direct damage. The devastation suggested that Ghana was not prepared for such a catastrophe.  To make Ghana a climate resilient nation, UNDP supported state agencies through long term strategies to deal with climate change under the Africa Adaptation Programme (AAP). The Africa Adaptation Programme was implemented from 2010 to 2013, across 20 countries in Africa to help with the continent’s response to climate change and natural disasters, by building capacities at the government level for long-term planning for climate change, as well as implementing simple, effective interventions to explore and demonstrate what climate change adaptation means on the ground.

A case in point is the Aowin Suaman District Assembly in the Western Region of Ghana, which received training to mainstream climate change and disaster risk reduction into their District Development Plans. The district was also supported to implement practical climate change adaptation projects such as the construction of a new light industrial market to relocate business owners that were working in flood-prone areas. Through the participation of local stakeholders, the AAP has also supported the construction of foot bridges at key crossing points in the Keta District so that children can cross over flooded lands during the rainy season to attend school, as well as women and men to commute to work or to the market.

The  AAP  pilot   activities   in   Aowin   Suaman   and Keta are excellent examples of  how  simple,  and relatively low cost, measures can help  communities attain short-term and long-term benefits through mainstreaming  the  issues  of climate   change   and disaster risk reduction into development planning. Through   these   programmes,   the   UNDP    strives    to build a culture of disaster resilience enhancing the knowledge and understanding of the hazards types, tackling various vulnerabilities   of   the   communities and    generating    innovative     and     indigenous solutions  through    capacity    building    and    education.

The following are some of the successes the AAP has chalked in Ghana. With respect to mainstreaming Climate Change, the programme has supported the development of the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) which was approved by Cabinet in May 2013. Moreover, all 170 administrative districts have been trained on mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The initiative has also supported the integration of climate change (CC) into the Functional Organisation Assessment Tool which is a prerequisite for budgetary allocations to District Assemblies development projects and programmes. The AAP’s effort to mainstream CCA and DRR at the district levels led to 64 out of 149 districts (43%) that submitted their 2012 Composite Budget to have CCA activities mainstreamed and budgeted within their budgets. As a result, in 2012, districts in Ghana allocated over Gh¢ 27 million to implement CCA activities in their districts. The African Adaptation programme also championed the incorporation of CCA and DRR into the Ghana Building Code.

The AAP was successful in building capacity of high level leaders in Ghana. For instance, Members of Parliament, Council of State, the Government’s Economic Management Team, Regional Ministers, Regional Coordinating Directors, District Chief Executives, Chief Directors and Directors of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), Religious leaders, and Commissioners of the National Development Planning Commission were engaged through High Level Interactive Workshops to create awareness on climate change and deliberate on how they could support mainstreaming of CCA and DRR in their various areas of authority. In all, more than 160 high level leaders in Ghana were engaged and commitments made to facilitate the mainstreaming process at various levels.

The AAP tested approaches to enhance CCA capacity in 5 pilot districts through in-depth planning and implementaiton of CCA measures such as construction of a foot bridge (Keta District), relocation of markets and light industrial sites to a higher ground (Aowin-Suaman District) and providing pumps for dry-season farming (Sissala East and West Mamprusi Districts).

The Africa Adaption Programme has also supported the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) to improve its frequency, volume, and quality of weather data by installing 8 Automated Weather Stations (AWS) and 1 High Speed Computer and provided training on early warning signs to build the capacity of GMet Staff to gather, monitor, and utilize weather data for improved weather forecasting, early warning, and future climate projections.

Flood and drought vulnerability maps have been created for communities in all 5 AAP pilot districts using GPS and GIS. Safe havens have also been identified and mapped and evacuation plans prepared for the flood-prone areas. A Climate Change Community of Practice (CoP) was established, comprising experienced and young professionals and researchers who collect and analyze local climate data and use models for making future climate projections. They have been working in collaboration with the University of Cape Town Climate Systems Analysis Group (CSAG). This aside, the Government of Ghana and UNDP developed a project that seeks to continue AAP’s efforts in Early warning Systems establishment for the next 3 years called the Community Resilience through Early Warning (CREW).

The AAP has also supported 2 international workshops on climate change economics and finance for 58 Ghanaians and 53 International participants drawn from relevant institutions. These training workshops explored, in great detail, various climate change finance options (including modalities) as well as the economic analysis of various adaptation options. An initial design document for establishing a Functional Institutional Finance Mechanism for climate change in Ghana was developed based on recommendations and good practices from other countries gathered through the workshop.

UNDP continues to support the Government of Ghana to become “climate-finance ready” through facilitation provided through the establishment and access of various international climate finance such as the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation
Fund, where Ghana’s proposal for the Adaptation Fund was technically approved in 2013. AAP supported the development of a Guide for Mainstreaming Climate Change and Disaster Risk into national development policies and planning. The guides were disseminated and utilized by District Budget Officers to incorporate CCA into their district plans and budgets. Moreover, the AAP published an Indigenous Knowledge Atlas that compiles local knowledge related to climate and weather through research conducted in the 5 pilot districts.

Drought and Flood Hazard Maps have been developed for 5 AAP pilot districts. Various audio-visual materials have also been developed, such as: A documentary on CCA in Ghana, local adaptation in Northern Ghana and Burkina Faso. These documentaries were utilized as materials for the high level awareness raising events. Finally, local theater groups were trained to perform informational skits on CCA performed at the various awareness raising events.",[],"Africa,Climate change,Ghana,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Adaptation,Success Stories"

When it comes to refrigerators, I can find a million reasons why new is better than old,” says George Effah Baffoe, a retired engineer and father of five as he turns in his old refrigerator for a new, energy efficient one.

Together, the two million fridges and air conditioning units used in Ghana consume three times more energy than the maximum allowed in countries with more solid regulations. For many, this means an additional expenditure of USD 50 to USD 100 on electricity every year.

Across the country, every energy inefficient appliance generates over 0.7 tons of carbon emissions each year. When not properly disposed, these appliances release up to two tons of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere.

To reduce Ghana’s carbon emission and other ozone depleting substance related to energy, the Government of Ghana launched a “rebate and turn in” programme in September 2012, with the support of UNDP and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The scheme encourages consumers to exchange their old refrigerators for new and efficient ones, available at a discounted price.

A massive campaign was launched on television and the radio, reaching out to the general public on energy efficient appliances, standards and labels.

Having learned about the rebate scheme through a radio promo, Mr. Baffoe turned in two old refrigerators for a three-star equivalent and received a rebate of USD 70.
He now saves USD 25 per month on electricity. “As a retiree, this amount is very significant. It is especially beneficial at a time like this, when the electricity company of Ghana has increased tariffs across the country,” he says.

Thanks to the programme, more than 5,200 units of old, energy inefficient appliance have been replaced across the country and 15,000 are expected to be replaced by the end of 2015. The law now requires that all new refrigerators carry official energy efficiency labels.

A ban on the importation of used refrigerating appliance in 2013 prevented over 260,000 old appliances from entering into the country and an 80 percent drop in their imports by the end of 2014.

“The few that are smuggled into the country are confiscated at the ports and decommissioned at recycling facilities. So far over 20,000 seized refrigerators have been sent to the recycling facilities”, says Eric Kumi Antwi-Agyei, the Project Coordinator at the Energy Commission of Ghana.

UNDP and GEF have so far invested over USD 2.1 million into the programme, helping the Energy Commission and Environmental Protection Agency to bring scrap dealers, retailers and consumers into the scheme.

“With this intervention, Ghana makes an annual energy savings of 34,550MWh, enough to power 11,516 households in a year”, says Eric Kumi Antwi-Agyei.  

UNDP continues to support the Government of Ghana to promote the country’s transition towards a green economy and a low-carbon and climate resilient society.
As part of the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, Ghana has embarked on a UNDP-supported action plan to provide universal energy access, improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy for all Ghanaians by 2030.

Hawa lives with her husband and eight children in Tamalgu, a farming community in northern Ghana.-This region is much drier than the south, receiving an average annual rainfall of 750mm to 1,050mm. Agriculture is traditionally rain-fed and serves as the primary livelihood of more than 80 percent of the population.-In most parts of Ghana, climate change has affected farmers’ ability to predict the rains, which negatively affects planting and harvesting. Without additional water sources for irrigation, farming usually lasts only one season. This trend, together with the unfavourable climatic conditions, adversely impacts productivity, reduces farmers’ incomes and plunges many into poverty.-“Tilling in my sweat did little to improve my livelihood, but I had no option”, says Hawa. “Providing three square meals for my family was a luxury. Although my husband supported me, I still struggled to support the education of my children in school.""-Through a solar-powered irrigation project supported by the Energy Commission of Ghana and UNDP, smallholder farmers in the four communities of Tamalgu, Nakpanduri, Datoyili and Fooshegu can now irrigate their farm fields regularly.-Launched in October 2014, the programme has installed a solar-powered irrigation pump in each of the four communities. Altogether, the pumps are capable of watering up to 15 hectares of land, while the solar panels have a total capacity of 22.5 kilowatts and are capable of delivering up to 1 million litres of water each day.-The initiative was implemented by NewEnergy, a local NGO that seeks to make sustainable energy accessible and affordable to smallholder farmers.-“Our aim is to facilitate a year-round farming at the selected communities by making water available,” says Mahama Amadu, Chairman of NewEnergy.-Hawa is one of 78 farmers who have benefitted from the intervention so far. “Before the project, I spent an average of US $10 [a fifth of the monthly minimum wage in Ghana] on fuel each month to power a rented pump to irrigate my field. At a point, I could not sustain it due to the high running cost,” she says.-Irrigating fields through fuel-powered pumps also required connecting several pieces of rented water hoses. Assembling and disassembling the hoses daily is tedious, and over time the hoses suffer wear and tear, adding to maintenance costs. With the installation of the solar powered pumps, such costs have been minimized.-Now, each farmer contributes an average of $2.5 monthly toward a cooperative fund to ensure proper maintenance of the equipment and maintain capital for future investments.-“The constant supply of water from the solar-powered pumps offers me the prospect to harvest at least three times each year, instead of one,” says Hawa. “This means increased income, food and improved nutrition for my household. With this, I can support my children’s education.”-With assistance from NewEnergy, the farmers have also established good relationships with reputable purchasers who help them to sell the farm produce.-Besides the traditional flood irrigation techniques, the project also introduced, on a pilot basis, a drip irrigation demonstration kit in each of the four communities. This technology utilizes water more efficiently and makes it possible for more farmers to access the same solar PV system and expand the irrigation area.-The Government of Ghana endorses the initiative. “I am highly impressed with the technology in use here, as well as the enthusiasm and commitment of the farmers,” says Dr Alhassan Yakubu, Deputy Minister of Agriculture.-Ghana was one of the first countries to embark on the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative, launching a SE4ALL Action Plan in June 2012. The Plan identifies key barriers and proposes critical actions and commitments to address needs in the energy sector. It is expected that the solar-powered irrigation pumps will be sustained, replicated and scaled up to provide more self-employment opportunities for youth who would otherwise be forced to move from rural to urban areas in search of work.",[],"Sustainable development,Success Stories,Poverty reduction and inequality"

Cocoa, which is the main source of income for more than 800,000 smallholder farmers in Ghana. It is also a major foreign exchange earner for the country.-For most farmers, expanding cocoa farms means clearing forests. Lack of incentives and understanding of smarter ways to incorporate trees in cocoa farms result in several farmers removing trees on their cocoa farms. This practice has been one of the main contributors to the loss of more than 135,000 hectares of forests each year.-“I have seen over the years that this phenomenon is not only adversely impacting on cocoa production, but also affecting plant and animal life as well as water resources”, says Mr. Daniel Amponsah Gyinayeh, a cocoa farmer.-The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), and with financial support from Mondelēz International Cocoa Life Programme, introduced farmers to environmentally friendly practices that can also boost cocoa production and rehabilitate degraded cocoa landscapes.-Through the implementation of the three-year project “Environmental Sustainability and Policy for Cocoa Production in Ghana” “ESP project”, more than 9,600 smallholder farmers have been incentivized to adopt sound farming practices that reduce climate change and improve environmental quality.-This has occurred largely through training of cocoa farmers and community extension agents in environmental cocoa production practices, forest laws and regulations, and community tree tenure rights. The US$ 1.7 million initiative has also piloted the establishment of Community Resource Management Areas (CREMA) involving 36 communities in the Asunafo North Municipality to promote community rights to manage and benefit from natural resources.-The project has distributed more than 787,000 economic tree seedlings to farmers and rehabilitated 8,600 hectares of forests along waterways and protected areas. Field monitoring records have shown a progressive planting success. This has motivated farmers to plant more trees, which shield the cocoa plants from excessive sunlight and keep the soil moist during dry seasons. The trees also serve as carbon sinks and provide oxygen, which replenishes the environment.-“We are happy to work with the farmers on climate smart farming practices”, says Namho Oh, a Programme Analyst at UNDP. “We hope that through this intervention we can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation and ensure increased cocoa productivity and income for farmers.”-Now, Daniel, like other farmers, is upbeat about the future. On his farm, he has planted hundreds of economic tree seedlings he received under the project. He looks forward to a good return on his hard work. “Thanks to UNDP and COCOBOD, I can benefit from my trees and expect increased cocoa yield through the improved farming methods,” he says.-The “ESP project” is also supporting Ghana’s land and tree tenure policy reforms by providing concrete policy recommendations and facilitating dialogues with the COCOBOD, Forestry Commission, and other key stakeholders.-The initiative builds on national efforts to improve Ghana’s progress on the MDG 7 establishing tree plantations and replanting degraded forests to reduce deforestation, which is estimated at 2% per annum. It also offers a good prospect for Ghana’s attainment of the new Sustainable Development Goal 15 which seeks to, among other things, help countries sustainably manage forests.

These boreholes are providing access to clean water to over 10,000 beneficiaries, mainly women and children.-The simple hand-pump technology was adopted for various reasons. First, the boreholes can reach deeper aquifers than wells and, thus, are more flexible for use in Northern Ghana where aquifers are located 10 to 60 meters underground. Second, the low-income levels of beneficiary communities and their disperse settlements make boreholes a more effective and efficient water supply system given their low maintenance cost.-The lack of, or inadequate drinking water arising out of extreme climate events such as droughts and floods, increases the exposure of people, especially women and children to water-borne and hygiene related diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera.-The provision of the boreholes has helped to significantly reduce the vulnerabilities of the rural dwellers, especially women and children to adverse climate change impacts.-Interacting with a section of the Timon- Gurre community, UNDP Country Director, Mr. Dominic Sam emphasized the critical role women play in making communities resilient. He encouraged members of the communities to ensure active participation of women in the management of the water supply systems. -These boreholes serve not only for domestic uses, but also provide water for more than 3,000 livestock in the beneficiary communities. ""We no more spend long hours in search of potable water and in competing among ourselves and with livestock for water"", says Faustina John Kitunam of the Bombilla community, a beneficiary of the intervention. -The provision of the boreholes by UNDP has not only helped reduce water borne diseases and the time and distance our women and children cover in search of water but also served our animals.

In Ghana, like many African countries, it is difficult for the poor and vulnerable to access justice, due partly to high cost of legal services. It even becomes more challenging when it comes to legal representation for cases such as child care, criminal justice and domestic abuse including unending disagreements between partners.

Due to population growth and expansion of medical services, there have been an increase in the generation of hazardous waste in health facilities. The effect of these has been the exposure of healthcare workers, patients and nearby communities to toxic substances which pose threats to their health and the environment.-“Since 1998, we were using the incineration system which pollute the environment and expose our staff and patients to a lot of risks. But now, from the ongoing UNDP-GEF project, we have received 2 autoclave machines which sterilize our infectious waste and turn them into general waste”, Evans Asamoah, Medical Waste Project Focal Person at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital revealed.-As narrated by Evans, health care waste is managed in many hospitals in Ghana through the use of incinerators, which burn waste at a low temperature, often emitting substances such as dioxins and furans. These substances have been identified as harmful pollutants under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants due to their tendency of causing diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis.-Thanks to funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) in partnership with the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, the World Health Organization and the NGO Health Care Without Harm, have been implementing the Medical Waste project since 2016, to promote the adoption of best practices in health care waste management.-The project has so far provided 5 autoclave technologies to 3 hospitals (Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Koforidua Regional Hospital and Tegbi Health Centre), for the treatment of health care waste before disposal. Each of these autoclave technologies have the capacity to treat 25kilograms of healthcare waste per treatment cycle (maximum 90 minutes).-The project has also built the capacity of over 600 health personnel from these on best waste management practices and on the operations and maintenance of the autoclaves. Two other hospitals, Winneba Trauma and Specialist Hospital, and the Greater Accra Regional Hospital also benefited from the training.  -“After the training on best medical waste management, we formed a waste management team who conducts weekly monitoring exercise on waste management practices in the hospital. We can proudly say we think we are one of the neatest hospitals in Ghana"", Ms. Worlasi Nukpe, the Project’s focal person at the Winneba Trauma and Specialist Hospital, indicated.-The efficient health care waste management systems established by the project in its pilot facilities has attracted interest from other countries in Africa, prompting the Government of Uganda led by a delegation from its Ministry of Health to come on a study tour to observe the interventions, to be presented as best practice for replication in Uganda.-“We have the autoclave technology, and this can be replicated in Uganda. Aside the knowledge on such technologies, we also learnt that we need to collaborate with manufacturers and train our local people to ensure this equipment work efficiently, added Ms. Pamela Achii, Health Product Management Specialist at the Ministry of Health, Uganda.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 12']","Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Ghana,News,Success Stories"

But these days, it dries up 3 times in the year, and the water becomes muddy, but because we have no choice, we have to use it”: Inusah Ibn Hassan, Assemblyman for the village of Tampion in the Northern Region of Ghana, is very aware of the negative impacts of climate change on natural resources and livelihoods.
-More frequent and severe weather events mean unmet water needs, declining crop yields and food insecurity affecting the most vulnerable. And, with average temperatures rising faster in the northern savannah region than in the coastal areas of Ghana, risks include increased north-south migration.-To respond to these impacts, Ghana has made significant progress on the policy front. The country is one of the few in Sub Saharan Africa with a National Climate Change Policy document and an implementation plan for its Nationally Determined Contributions. In addition, a comprehensive integrated water management and investment plans for the Black Volta and Oti river basins is expected to address the underlying drivers of water resource degradation and stimulate investments, as well as reduce the impact of climate change on surface and groundwater sources and livelihood.  -The challenge however, is to translate these policy documents into concrete actions at the local level. In the northern savannah region, over 60% of households depend on wells compared to national average of 32.3%. Similarly, about 21% depend on natural water sources such as rivers, rainwater, ponds or reservoirs for their water use, compared to 9% at the national level. -To address these concerns, UNDP, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), is helping vulnerable communities in Northern Ghana to better manage their water resources and diversify livelihoods.-With funding from the Adaptation Fund, a 4-year project supports small-scale irrigation schemes and water harvesting systems to ensure year-round water availability for agricultural production and productivity. Other initiatives include drilling boreholes, constructing or rehabilitating sand dams and canals, as well as providing alternative livelihood interventions such as shea butter and groundnut oil extraction, beekeeping, fish farming, tree seedling nurseries and dry season vegetable production in the 50 communities of Northern Ghana.  -At the community level, another project funded by the Norwegian Government seeks to improve understanding of climate-related risks, reduce vulnerability to hazards, and enhance capacities for disaster risk reduction in ten districts of Ghana. On top of providing hazard mapping, early warning systems and vulnerability assessments to reduce economic and human losses due to disasters, the project also supports the installation of boreholes and dugouts to improve the resilience of rural communities to climate change impacts while supporting Ghana’s implementation of SDG 6: Access to clean water and sanitation.-So far, over 130 boreholes have been drilled in 50 climate risks communities, providing access to clean water to over 45,000 people, mainly women and children.-“We used to suffer to get water especially during the dry season and had to travel far. With this borehole water close-by, we can only be grateful”, says Fatima Mahama, a resident of Kakease in Savannah Region of Ghana.-Thanks to this support, over USD 1 million investment income have been made in the last two years, directly benefiting more than 5000 people (60% women) and indirectly benefiting over 100,000 people.

Over 80% of the residents in her region and in Northern Ghana as a whole, depends on rain-fed agriculture for their food, income and livelihoods. With climate change, the incidence of droughts continues to increase, having devastating impacts on the people, especially women.
-Women in rural communities in most developing countries like Ghana are often vulnerable to climate change because they depend a lot on local natural resources for their livelihoods. They secure water, food and fuel for cooking. Despite this, most women do not own and control resources especially land.
-“Most of us do not farm during the dry season and life becomes difficult as we don’t earn any income”, stated Agabeni Abaa in Yindongo, Upper East Region of Ghana.
-To respond to this, a dry season garden initiative is currently being implemented by the Government of Ghana, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as part of a 4-year project, to build community resilience to climate change impacts. The project, being supported by Adaptation Fund, is building the resilience of women and men in over 50 communities. Agabeni and Rose are among the over 2500 women benefiting directly.
-“In Yindongo, we have a 24-acre dry season garden and we are about 100 women benefiting from the initiative. Every 3 days is market day here, so we sell the vegetables and also consume some”, Agabeni indicated.
-The dry season gardening is not only benefiting women but men as well. Both women and men are being supported with land preparation, seedlings, irrigation facilities, pesticides and with technical support to produce different exotic and local vegetables (onion, cabbage, lettuce, green pepper, pepper, tomatoes, spring onion, beans etc.).
-“We have 10 men and 20 women being supported in our village Goli and this is helping us. I have already made good income from my first harvest, more than Ghc1000 ($200) from the sale from 3 beds green pepper and 4 beds lettuce and cabbage. I also have onions, cucumber and pumpkin leaves which are almost ready for the market”, Godfred Datuah, Vegetable Farmer at Goli, Upper West Region of Ghana.
-Beside the dry season gardening, the adaptation fund project is also supporting the communities with boreholes, rehabilitation of dams for irrigation and other water uses; and providing other alternative livelihood interventions such as agro-processing, beekeeping, fish farming, and tree seedling nurseries, all in Northern Ghana. 
-As the world embarks on years of ambition to tackle climate change, it is important to integrate gender issues in climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.

She is a resident of Tampion community in the Northern Region of Ghana. Aisha and many other women in Tampion directly depend on the only dam in the community for domestic and commercial uses. For the residents of Tampion, having water available all year round, is good. “We now have water throughout the year, we can always do our washing. We also use it to cook and drink it”, indicated Aisha.  -For over 3 decades, members of this community occasionally depended on silted water from the Tampion dam for their daily water needs. This dam, which is being used for many purposes including drinking and fishing, also gets almost dried up during the dry season and becomes muddy, making it difficult to get clean water for use. Changes in climatic conditions such as decreasing and increasing rainfall patterns are adversely affecting rural livelihoods in the area.-The community has a population of about 5000. Their new array of hope is a project being implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with support from Adaptation Fund. The project, which aims to enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of communities to climate impacts and risks on water resources in Northern Ghana, has supported the Tampion community to plant about 1500 trees on one-hectare land, fenced with galvanized chain wall as a buffer zone, to prevent pollution. The buffer zone is maintained up to 50meters from the protected water body, preventing farmers from farming close to the water body, as farming activities close-by lead to sediments (sand and stones) getting into the water body. The trees in the buffer zone were planted by the local people in the community, with funding from the project.-According to members of the community, the buffer zone provided since 2017, is preventing erosion and protecting the dam.-“The acacia trees we planted around the dam are protecting the water and preventing stones and sand from our farms from going into the water. It is also making it difficult for flooding from the community to get into the dam these days”, said Honorable Inusah Ibn Hassan, Assemblyman of Tampion.
-The elders of the Tampion community appreciate the buffer zone support and the many other initiatives being provided including the provision of boreholes, support for vegetable farming, fish farming, beekeeping, nurseries and agro-processing, which they believed will uplift people from poverty in the area.-The project, which is being implemented in 50 communities in 10 districts of the Upper East, Upper West and Northern Regions of Ghana, is to help protect water bodies and improve livelihoods in the three northern regions of Ghana. It is also expected to contribute to Ghana’s efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on climate change (SDG 13); the goals on poverty eradication (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), and access to clean water and improved sanitation (SDG 6).

These practices end up costing Iraq a high price when it comes to its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to all the pollution of soil and water they directly cause.-Solid waste management is the process through which solid waste is collected, transported and treated.- - -As part of the peer-to-peer component of UNDP’s Supporting Recovery and Stability in Iraq through Local Development program, funded by the European Union, two waste management projects are being implemented in Nineveh and Thiqar as a partnership between the European peer: PIN Prato of Prato Italy and the local authorities in both governorates.-Pin Prato is the University pole of Prato, a city in Italy with a renowned history of recycling.-The peer-to-peer component is an opportunity to bring European expertise to different Iraqi governorates, and initiate partnerships with the local authorities that support local development in various areas and assist in the process of decentralizing the power from central to local authorities in jointly selected sectors.-The projects are designed to tackle the solid waste issues that both governorates suffer from.-Mosul, the capital of Nineveh governorate, had a functional solid waste collection system before 2014. However, the city’s municipal services, including waste collection, were hit hard as a result of the conflict. Due to the debris of destruction in the city, lack of resources and a growing population (Iraq’s 2nd most populated city), solid waste collection happens at a much lower rate than it once did and not as effectively.- -The project in Nineveh, therefore, aims to assist the governorate in reestablishing a system with new added aspects. These include the adoption of an integrated action plan that addresses all the areas of solid waste management, from collection to treatment plant needed, to recovery of current landfill.as well as training the concerned technical staff of the governorate.-Similarly, in Nasiriyah, the capital of Thiqar governorate, most of the solid waste goes to uncontrolled landfills that are close to residential areas or watercourses. Another part of the waste is burned to reduce its volume. The Italian peers have provided a waste management action plan and the equipment necessary to help start the process of separating dry and wet collected waste. Equipment such as electromechanical composter, waste collection truck, bins etc. In addition to training of municipality’s operators on how to operate the machinery and maintain it. The municipality will later take control of the project and run the collection and composting and run the process in its entirety.- -Despite the difficulties the country faces when it comes to waste management, similar projects have been implemented throughout Iraq already. Recently, experts from the Italian side and the UNDP team paid a visit to Ecocem, a waste treatment plant in Sulaymaniyah. This plant uses collected waste to produce refuse-derived fuel (RDF) which is used to run cement factories.-The visit was an opportunity for the project partners, Iraqi and Italian, to see a local successful business that is doing an inspiring work in the field of waste management.- ",[],"Success Stories,Iraq"

Document. Adapt. Repeat what works.-6 out of Jamaica's 24 hospitals targeted-Implemented 2016 to 2021 by UNDP Multi Country Office in Jamaica in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Wellness and the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology, the project retrofitted six of Jamaica's 24 public hospitals with LED bulbs and installed grid-tied solar photovoltaic systems at three of the six. Staff was also trained to operate and maintain the systems to secure sustainability of the investment.-Maintenance supervisors like Carlton Grant of May Pen Hospital based in a large town in south central Jamaica have a close-up of the impact: “It’s a very, very good initiative. We have saved a lot on our electricity and as you know a hospital is where you use high voltage. At this time our bills should be cutting by more than half. This is very good not just for the hospital but for the Ministry of Health and Jamaica as a whole. It's a very good cost saving.”-Projected Savings  -Energy consumption at the six participating hospitals was running 4.8 million kilowatt hours every year before the retrofits, Expert analysis conducted by former UNDP project manager Tenny Daley indicates the solar and LED investment is on track to save $348,944 USD per annum at all six hospitals.-At the three hospitals selected for both LED and solar retrofits, average annual savings is expected to be one third of their current spend. Multiyear savings for all six hospitals is projected at $3.5 million USD.-The interventions are expected to reduce the public health sector energy consumption bill by 22% annually, according to the Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Hon. Daryl Vaz. Twenty two percent is a welcome milestone for the Government of Jamaica which has set a benchmark of 15% reduction in overall public sector energy consumption by improving energy efficiency and deploying Renewable Energy.- -Over five-years (2013 to 2018) government entities had already generated US$2.2 million in savings, cut its fossil fuel consumption by 3500 barrels, and reduced its carbon footprint 5800 tons in fulfilment of this policy position, states 2019 news reports attributed to former Science and Technology Minister Fayval Williams; by 2020, a nine-year assessment reported 3.2 Million USD in savings.-Green energy initiatives are rigorously pursued due to the potential impact on the public purse. Government was billed USD $171 million in 2012, with the health sector accounting for 6% of the total bill. Fossil fuels make up one third of Jamaica’s import bill – a whopping 15% of GDP – which impacts the ability of the government to invest in key social sectors such as education, health, and social safety nets.-With 2500 to 3000 hours of bright sunshine annually, Jamaica’s options for exploiting this sustainable energy source are immeasurable, and the GEF-funded project is making it possible to generate 'sun powered' savings for sustainable development.-“This is a very significant project to the health sector. Energy consumption is a critical part of our operations,” states Leslie James, the Ministry of Health and Wellness’ senior director for project management and health facilities. “To a large extent this is a very impactful project, and we hope to be able to expand to other facilities to see a change in our energy consumption in health facilities,” he says.-Maintenance has been taken care of for the next three years, working in tandem with technical staff, James points out. He says “the capacity building training is helping to create a culture change so that people are more aware of energy consumption and measures to reduce consumption.” To this end, monitoring has been digitized, enabling hospital operations and maintenance teams to remotely monitor solar energy generation via secure login on smart devices. The hospitals are now observing daily and monthly kilowatt of energy generation on demand.-Jacqueline Ellis, Chief Executive Officer of two of the participating hospitals – National Chest Hospital and Sir John Golding Rehab Centre – says the expected reduction in electricity bills is welcome as this is a major cost driver for the health sector. “The fact that we are working with a tight budget - savings in that area will definitely help us as an organization”, she states.-“When we were using the incandescent and the fluorescent bulbs our light bill was very high,” recalls Milton Grant from May Pen Hospital. “Since we put in the LED and our solar panels, we have long lasting life span on the tubes which is very good”, he reports.-A six-month trend analysis of the LED bulb retrofit in just three of the participating hospitals in 2020 confirms they had cut energy use an average 17.6%, saving $1.5 million JMD. This resulted in a modest but promising reduction of 30 tons of CO2 and a reduction of 25 barrels of oil over that short period.-The project was ambitious in its intentions to spread similar impacts to the average householder and small business, by seeking to facilitate the birth of an Energy Services Company (ESCO) industry in Jamaica. Tenny Daley calls the ESCO “a unique model to reduce upfront costs of renewable energy and energy efficiency interventions, while managing design and installation from start to finish”. Although the goal was not realised, the project was able to sow seeds that await further work to bear fruit.-The industry now needs standardization so that all the players know the requirements, says Enbar Consulting Principal Consultant David Barrett, an advocate for the ESCO industry. He praised the GEF-funded project for providing tools and training in ESCO measurement and verification and the energy performance contract which standardizes the expectation between the client and the provider.-“If the ESCO market takes off ... we will have standardized procedures, ultimately reduce the amount of energy consumed and massively increase levels of renewable clean energy that we utilize”, he says.-For now, plugging into the sun and opting for cooler, efficient lighting solutions is creating a blueprint for energy-productive, cost-efficient operations for local hospitals. Experts and advocates look to teams from six local hospitals for a harvest of data to light the way forward.

We tried to close up the windows, but we couldn’t, the force was so strong,” she recalls.  

It was 1st September 2019 on Abaco, an island in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas archipelago. The category five hurricane hovered for over 48 hours, packing wind gusts of 220 miles per hour and 20-foot storm surges. On record it’s the strongest to ever make landfall in the country, and one of the most powerful in human history.  

Pauline watched as “cesspit water started flowing in like a faucet in the backyard, and water started to come inside the house”.  She sought refuge in a friend’s apartment. “When I came back to check on my place, all the windows were burst out, the roof was opened up, so my place was flooded”.-
In the aftermath, an inconvenient truth had become real: Saunders’ home, like many others in the direct path of Hurricane Dorian, was not built for hurricane resilience.    
Half of the houses and buildings in eastern Grand Bahama and Abaco were either destroyed or severely damaged, and 100% were decimated in several districts – 3000 in total.  -
Dorian left behind 3.4 billion USD in damage – equal to one-quarter of the nation’s GDP, says the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Seventy-four people died and 245 were estimated to be missing a year later. More than 29,500 people were homeless and/or jobless, and 2,500 small and medium sized businesses impacted. In its wake, 1.7 million cubic metres of debris choked gullies, roadways and yards. Overwhelmed by floodwater, houses in 50 plus subdivisions were mold contaminated – a health hazard. -
“True recovery begins with the actions taken to reduce vulnerability to risks and improve resilience, while at the same time, reducing the time it takes to recover from crisis,” concluded Denise E Antonio, UNDP Resident Representative assigned to six countries in the Caribbean including The Bahamas.

Leading a surge team days after the storm, and later, efforts to craft UNDP’s crisis prevention and recovery intervention, Antonio reiterated Government’s call for resilient recovery based on ‘Building Back Better’.  “We must prepare for what is fast becoming the new norm - increasingly powerful and destructive storms that illustrate the harsh reality of climate change,” she concluded.
 
Led by Government, inclusive resilience-building became a guiding force for UNDP support. Bahamas took aim at sustainable and resilient construction methods; emergency employment for environmental clean ups; long-term resilient recovery plans; and build back better know how. The goal was to ensure Bahamians like Pauline Saunders could face future disasters with minimum disruption.-
Digital applications partly powered the process at the outset. In partnership with Engineers Without Borders, 20 Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) officials were trained to use UNDP’s Housing and Building Damage Assessment (HBDA) mobile app to rapidly determine the types, extent and causes of the damage. The tool helped the MOPW team assess 5,276 structures, generating quality data including real-time geo-referenced reports, to inform resilient recovery plans.-Antonio says quality research informed by quality data is a key plank of UNDP’s support, yielding a raft of research papers to inform policy. These include a Marine Debris Plan and an environment restoration Plan for hurricane affected biodiversity hotspots and Socio Economic Impact Assessments. But perhaps the most significant plank in the resilience ‘architecture’ to date came with the development of Resilient Recovery Policy & Guidelines, a National Disaster Resiliency Strategy and Implementation Plan, and an Institutional Assessment Report. All three were approved by Cabinet on 27th October 2020. “The stage is now being set for a hurricane resilient future for The Bahamas”, the Resident Representative said.-“These Cabinet-approved plans provide the policy framework for the government to prepare, respond and recover from disaster, and a road map for the institutional development of the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction”, explained UNDP’s Ava Whyte Anderson, Programme Analyst, Capacity Development, who provides oversight for the Bahamas recovery project. “This”, she said, “is where the road to resilient recovery starts”.-John Michael Clarke, Chairman of the Disaster Reconstruction Authority underscored the pivotal role of these developments, noting that UNDP’s collaboration with NEMA and the DRA has not only borne fruit but proven to be essential in Bahamas’ resilient construction drive. “Since the devastating effects of Hurricane Dorian on the Bahamas islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, UNDP has played a vital role. First with assisting in the organization of the recovery effort and then with the creation of knowledge-based tools to aid in the long-term reconstruction,” he said.-
On the ground, The Bahamas and UNDP partnered to get valuable ‘build better’ knowledge into the hands of the people to set foundations for a culture shift. A mobile Technical Assistance Centre (TAC) in a repurposed RV was deployed to Grand Bahama, offering door to door home repair advisory services to reinforce ‘build better’ tips, techniques and resources. It is the Caribbean’s first, based on a tripartite partnership model involving UNDP, Rotary Clubs of The Bahamas and the Disaster Reconstruction Authority (DRA). UNDP’s Bahamas Recovery Project Coordinator Etoile Pinder says the TACs conducted 309 home assessments for DRA on Grand Bahama and provided guidance to NGOs working on construction and rebuild projects via 20 virtual consultations in Abaco.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Disaster recovery,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 13  Climate action,Disaster risk management,Latin America & the Caribbean,Success Stories"

The reports illustrate that these Projects have helped to mitigate the impacts of Climate Change by channelling good quality drinking water into pipes, and reversing downturn in crop harvests, caused by increasingly dry conditions.-“Even more encouraging is the impact on health and sanitation, sustainable agriculture, sustainable livelihoods and local economies, largely achieved in partnership with members of the community, UNDP Resident Representative Denise E Antonio noted. “We are especially gratified that access to potable water may prove helpful in supporting the local fight against infectious diseases including COVID-19 in target communities and has proven to be particularly successful in boosting crop harvests in most instances,” she pointed out.-“On my recent field visit to the community of Richmond in St Ann, farmers who received water harvesting infrastructure under the JCCCP personally told me they had reaped 30 to 40 percent increases in harvests,” she reported.- -Significant impacts were also recorded in communities near Colouden and Crooked River in the hills of Clarendon a few years ago under a SGP small grant of 50 000 USD (total project cost of 132 000 USD). Residents, who had never seen water in their pipes for more than 50 years, partnered with UNDP/SGP intent on accessing drinkable water, reducing water-borne diseases and increasing agricultural production by installing a gravity-fed system designed to channel  water from a spring to a 22,000-gallon  tank, then to six community ‘stand pipes’ serving more than 6300 residents. “We can see it has made a difference in everyone’s life ... people are now able to get water on a regular basis. Children go to school early and are no longer late; new shops are being set up; new houses and buildings being constructed; and people are returning to the area,” Samuel Fearon, then President, Colouden-Krall Community Action Committee has observed.- -Recent field visits and reports indicate that the school garden component of the JCCCP, implemented in partnership with the Jamaica 4H Clubs and the Climate Change Division in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, yielded: unprecedented harvests as high as 5000 pounds for just one type of produce; creation of new income sources for participating schools; expansion of school feeding programmes;  and notably, an unprecedented 100% completion rate for agricultural studies-related School Based Assessments at the Denbigh High School.- -The investments by GEF SGP and JCCCP focused on rehabilitation and construction of water community storage tanks; construction of earth ponds for irrigation; establishment of water harvesting systems including procurement of black storage tanks, conveyance systems and drip irrigation hoses, and construction of aquaponics greenhouse and fish tanks to support sustainable livelihoods.

With these investments making additional water available, communities have been able to improve standards of living and livelihoods by: Exploiting the potential of medicinal plants and establishing aquaponic ventures to enhance alternative livelihoods;  expanding agroforests, crops and livestock for food security; expanding water supply to school communities and making it available to surrounding communities. The infrastructure is maintained by local community councils and projects have already been replicated and upscaled.

Ms Antonio says the World Water Day reflection has been useful in underscoring best practices and lessons learnt, while justifying the focus of UNDP, GEF SGP and JCCCP on water harvesting as a viable channel for growth, health and poverty reduction. She called for more strategic partnerships to this end, and applauded government’s efforts to expand water harvesting and access to underserved communities especially in rural areas.

In front of  the gathered crowd, he described how rebel fighters had rounded up local villagers, flogged them, and forced them into the attic of a rice granary before setting fire to the building. He recounted how one assailant, named James, cut off Taly’s right ear and forced him to eat it.-“The man and his friends lied that I was an LPC fighter,” said Taly, referring to a different rebel group. “Some of us died from the beating and smoke.”-Listening to Taly’s account of violence during the Liberian civil war was a council of elders with training in human rights and alternative dispute resolution. Also in attendance was James, the accused, who is Taly’s neighbour and who spoke next.-“What he said is true,” he said. “Taly and I are friends. We drink liquor together. But I thought he forgot about what happened because he never talked about it before.” James pleaded for, and received, Taly’s forgiveness.-Scenes such as this have been happening in Liberia over the past five years as the country attempts to confront the extreme violence that characterised its two civil wars between 1989-1997 and 1999-2003. According to the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), Liberia suffered “every conceivable category of gross human rights and serious humanitarian law violation” during this period in which over 250,000 people were killed, more than one million were internally displaced, and hundreds of thousands fled the country.-There are ongoing discussions as to whether Liberia should establish a war crimes court or transitional justice commission to account for the most egregious atrocities, but in the meantime, the country has been holding so-called Palava Hut hearings. These were recommended by the TRC and are based on traditional restorative justice and accountability mechanisms.-Facilitated by the Independent National Commission on Human Rights (INCHR) with support from UNDP Liberia, Palava Huts provide safe public spaces where victims meet face-to-face with perpetrators of alleged violations and air their grievances before a trained council of elders. Like James, the accused typically admit guilt and, consistent with the traditional conflict resolution practices of the Bassa people, demonstrate penitence by squatting before their victims when asking for forgiveness.-The Palava Hut Committee then scolds the perpetrator and consoles the victim, offering their own apologies for their suffering. Once forgiven, the victim and perpetrator share a drink of blessed water to symbolise “heart-cleansing”, a consummation of a moral and spiritual vow to let go of the past and embrace a future of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence.-Since 2016, these justice mechanisms they have been used in different parts of the country to address violations of “lesser magnitude”, ranging from looting and destruction of property, to certain acts of torture and humiliation, to forced labour and displacement. Most recently, Palava Hut hearings were held in Rivercess country, which saw the first ever committee of elders headed by a woman because of the male paramount chief’s own involvement in the civil war. 49 cases were heard in the county, 48 of which were amicably resolved. This means that so far 259 cases have been resolved through Palava Hut hearings, and that 483 people helped have to deal with the trauma they experienced rebuilding social cohesion in their communities.-These traditional justice mechanisms are not designed to deliver justice for the large-scale human rights violations and atrocities that characterised Liberia’s civil wars. They may also do little in terms of addressing the serious physical and economic repercussions of victim’s experiences. But for many that have confronted their assailants through Palava Hut hearings, just being seen, heard, and asked for forgiveness can be hugely significant – as Sundaygar’s experience shows.-He told the Palava Hut hearing about how a fighter called Sabato and two others tortured and abused his family in 1994 in the village of Neezuin.-“Sabato asked my father to give them his single barrel gun. My father told them the gun was burned with our house. They got vexed and tied my father, my stepmother and I, and beat us with gun butts,” said Sundaygar, before going on to describe other forms of violence the fighters unleashed on them.-“Sometimes we forget some of what we did,” responded Sabato when it was his turn. “I didn’t ’t come here to argue. I apologise to Sundaygar and his family.”-For Sundaygar, this was enough for him to resolve his hurt and bitterness and end the matter. “This has been what I wanted,” he said. “Acknowledgement and an apology.”-This article was first published by African Arguments.",[],"Governance and peacebuilding,Success Stories"

The institution has a high gender disparity emanating from the traditional perception that policing is combative, and therefore better-suited for men. Most promotions and other strategic assignments are, as such, assigned to men. Today, even as the dynamics of policing are changing around the world, our senior supervisors are, to some extent, still treating women officers stereotypically.-The Gender Equity training was provided by the Emancipation Movement of Liberia, Inc. (EMOL), with support from UNDP. It was unlike any other police trainings I had ever attended in more ways than one. It was a beautiful experience. In my career as an officer, it was the first time I attended a gathering about policing in Liberia with more women than man; out of 50 participants, 21 were men and 29 women.-In this training, both senior and junior officers met and sat side by side to acquire knowledge and address some of the gender disparities in the institution. To the best of my knowledge, this training was a first of its kind, breaking hierarchical protocol bringing together both junior and senior officers to interact and discuss the various topics taught.-I am grateful for the manner in which this blending of attendees was done. Sitting and learning side-by-side my senior officers, who have the authority to promote and assign junior police officers, I was empowered by the knowledge acquired as well as the setting in which it was acquired. My senior supervisor was a participant too. He committed to refrain from all sorts of discrimination based on gender, and to be gender- sensitive in making decisions.-When I returned to work after the training, the knowlege I gained was extremely useful to my work. I have  become a more professional  person, as I interact with vulnerable women and children who need me, as well as my superiors who rely on my expertise to deliver. As a result, I was promoted, alongside other women colleagues who took part in the training. I was promoted from the third in command to the second in command in the Women and Children Protection Section of the Liberia National Police, with added leadership responsibilities. I am now the first “go-to-person” on matters relating to domestic violence before they can be escalated to the head of section.-The training served as an eye opener and has increased my knowledge and confidence such that today I can boldly and courageously stand up to take any task that my male counterparts are assigned.",[],"Governance and peacebuilding,Success Stories,Liberia"

With the enormous investment made in the Election Law Reform, the process is beginning to yield fruits, as the National Legislature approves some of the proposed amendments.-UNDP Liberia Resident Representative Pa Lamin Beyai sees this as a critical and pivotal milestone after over five years of investment in the process.-“This is the moment to form democratic consensus around any change people want to see, move beyond the surface and begin to think deeply about the future of the nation and its people.-UNDP Elections Basket Fund Donors-European Union, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, USAID, as well as key stakeholders, the National Elections Commission, Civil Society Organizations, Political Parties and the entire citizenry can boast of some deliverables.-According to Dr. Beyai, the constitution accommodates and forms the framework for a fair and democratic society that the Liberian people desire. “The national discussions and debates among political parties, key national stakeholders and the citizenry have stimulated a call to action by the government” he said.-Legislators have given the yes vote to  a number of constitutional provisions; Elections to be conducted on the Second Tuesday in November instead of Second Tuesday in October; reduction in the time allotted for the hearing of complaints coming from General Elections from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15); reduction in the tenure of the President from six (6) years to five (5) years; reduction in the term for Senators from nine (9) years to seven (7) years; reduction in the term of Representatives from six (6) to five (5)years and at least one of whose parents was a citizen at the time of the person’s birth, shall be a natural born citizen of Liberia. Such person does not have to reach the age of maturity to decide his/her citizenship. Also, a natural born citizen of Liberia may hold another citizenship, but shall not qualify for elected national or public service positions and appointed positions; among others.-There is an Official Gazette from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs into effect and ordered to be released in accordance with the law for the purposes of providing clear, correct and adequate information to the voting public about the proposed constitutional amendments to be presented to Liberians for a referendum vote.

As a result of beatings, she lost two pregnancies.-Speaking to UNDP, Nana was traumatized and in a state of confusion. She showed us scars on her head and on her left hand inflicted by her partner. She fled the violence at home and ended up in nightclubs and on ghetto streets drinking excessively, shooting illicit drugs and engaging in prostitution.-“I was so frustrated; I had to get out of this relationship. My life has been a complete mess. I have been involved in smoking, drinking, and sex work. I also did house-keeping jobs to get little money,” Nana said with a sad, serious and reflective expression on her face.-Nana was among over 500 disadvantaged youth that benefitted and graduated from a UNDP peacebuilding and vocational training program designed at empowering disadvantaged youth to make something of themselves.-“Since the introduction of this program, I have decided to be a better person. I went through the counselling and vocational trainings,” she said. “I am interested in hairdressing; I see my friends making money from it. I know I can do the same and get my shop open one day as long as I keep focus. I believe I can change. It’s not easy, but I’m sure that changes will come gradually,” the determined Nana said. She is also part of a village savings program through which she is saving up to open her salon.-Funded by the UN Peace-Building Support Office under the Liberia Multi-Partner Trust Fund (LMPTF) it is being implemented through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with the Government of Liberia, in partnership with the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD).-SEED targets 500 youth at risk within Montserrado County and meant for those mostly found in ghettos, street corners, cemeteries, and other unfit dwellings. Many are on drugs and other illicit substances.-They face these circumstances for different reasons, including peer pressure, Gender Based Violence (GBV), abuse, and trauma from a bad experience.-With the commencement of activities under the SEED Project, Nana has completed the first phase of the Psycho-social counseling provided by YWCA and was enrolled in the training on Business Management and Entrepreneurship (BMEs) skills.-As these young people go through the programme, they have expressed interests in plumbing, tailoring, the military, IT, graphic design, and hair dressing etc.-Willet Salu of CAFOD says, disadvantaged youths are at different educational levels, including high school, college but mostly elementary school dropouts. ”The dropouts are provided with Adult and financial literacy training to improve their numeracy and literacy skills, to fully grasp lessons on Business Management and Entrepreneurship,” says Willet.-They are divided into groups of 25, targeting New Kru Town, King Gray, Thinker’s Village, and Red-light, where beneficiaries are performing well and regularly attending the sessions, while for Central Monrovia, it’s a bit slow due to the attraction of other activities for the same group of people.-It is estimated that 79% of Liberia’s population is comprised of young people between the ages of 15 and 36 with at least 85% of them unemployed due to lack of education and skills which limits their chances of accessing social, economic and political opportunities.",[],"Sustainable development,Success Stories"

slow economic growth and rising prices; balance of payments deficits and depreciation of the Liberian currency; weak private sector, and mounting pressures on the national budget, to name a few.-UNDP Liberia mobilized resources and partnership through strategic actors and development partners- European Union, USAID, Peacebuilding Fund, and ECOWAS to lead the process of organizing the dialogue.-The NED provided a useful platform for national stakeholders to among other things:  distill required policy actions to implement specified strategies in the National Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development;

But my husband (a non-medical person) continued to treat me with mixed antibiotics by taking instructions on the phone from my friends who are nurses until I came back to life,” she narrated.-After additional treatments, Lydia and her family were declared Ebola free but continue to suffer serious stigmatization and humiliation in her community.-At her place of business, no one could easily buy from her, while at the same time, her husband was laid off from work because of the stigma.-Continuing, she points out that she has never benefited from any support for Ebola survivors because she was not treated in any of the Emergency Treatment Units (ETUs) but at home, therefore she does not have any identity card that others use to receive support.-Lydia also mentioned that she was ejected from a skills training program at one point in time.-“These and other conditions have made life unbearable for me,” says Lydia, a mother of 9 children. Six of them are hers while the other 3 are kids of neighbors who died as a result of Ebola.-However, hope was restored when she was contacted and profiled by the UNDP BOSS Team and assured of the project’s support.-Three (3) months after the assessment and validation Lydia was qualified and received US $450.00 as start-up fund to support her used clothes business.-With this amount, she quickly increased the size of her business moving from one or two bags of used clothes to four bags per purchase cycle.-The additional goods expanded the scope of her business as she periodically takes her goods to places on special market-days including some border towns in Guinea, while at the same time, giving some out to other young girls and boys to sell and pay the money thereafter.-She says this mode of business has allowed her to create jobs for over five persons.-According to Lydia, through the business, she is able to send all nine children to school.-The funds were residual money from UNDP Ebola Economic Recovery Fund intended to identify special cases to support.

The project coached and mentored over 200 business owners in four counties- Margibi, Bong, Nimba and Grand Bassa.-Jonathan started his business in 2016. He has blended the BOSS training with his prior agriculture knowledge to expand and improve his vegetable plot covering nearly an acre of land.-“Even though I don’t have any source of funding now, but the little money that I had prior to the training, I have been able to manage it to improve my business to where it is now,” says Jonathan.-According to him, he’s currently supplying supermarkets and marketers from Margibi, Montserrado and beyond. He intends to expand the farm to over three acres in the New Year.-""As a graduate of  the Booker Washington Institute, I had the agricultural knowledge, but never knew how to plan and manage a business well,” Jonathan intimates.-The BOSS Project aims at enhancing decentralization and support to the Micro and SME policy implementation in Liberia by providing opportunities to start-up, micro and small entrepreneurs and establishment of business support infrastructure at the County level. -It works to strengthen the skills of beneficiary groups: youth, women and small agricultural producers to participate and engage in decision-making to enhance leadership, volunteerism, and community participation.-With no prior knowledge in record keeping and other basic managerial skills, Jartu Zor started fabric designs (tye and dye) business in 2012 at age, 22.-Jartu, mother of two, explains that she would generate resources and spend with no accountability on her income and expenditures.-“I used to spend money foolishly. Sometimes on things I had no business buying, only because the money was in my hands and I had control over how to spend it, with no plan,” says Jartu.-She currently sells used clothing in Kakata and was part of the BOSS training in 2017.-Follow the training, like Jonathan and others, Jartu began applying the skills /knowledge acquired.

We have received more than 60 cases so far. The most common of them are theft, misapplication and sometimes, domestic violence...” said William Vincent, Lead Mediator, Community Justice Team in Kakata.-Established to cater for the over 5,000 residents of the Bassa Community in Kakata, Margibi County, the CTJ is now receiving complaints from neighbouring communities in the City. The Centre has nine mediators, 4 females and 5 males working.      -Vincent says the team is also strategizing on carrying out mobile awareness and sensitization in various communities to inform the people about the free mediation service being offered.-19year old Washington T. Nanyan, repairs phone and is a resident of Bassa Community. He unknowingly bought a stolen phone from a friend. The friend, Joshua had initially taken the smartphone (Techno L-9) to Washington for minor repairs and programming and was charged $10 USD for the service.-Few days later, according to Washington, Joshua came and requested Washington to rather purchase the phone because he (Joshua) couldn’t afford the $10 USD service cost.-“It was at that point I gave him L$1,500 ($10 USD), added to the other money ($10 USD) that he owed me. So, I paid $20 USD in total for the phone; but I didn’t know it was a stolen phone.-Later, the phone owner saw the phone with Washington and complained him to the centre. The mediators invited the parties concerned, including Joshua for inquiry. He said following the explanation, it was established that the phone was stolen by Joshua.-Washington said the team ably settled the matter without cost and void of going to the police or court. “I think it was good that they settle it here, because if we had gone to the police, we were going to pay money and they were also going to put me in jail for buying stolen item. But, the Community Justice Team settled the case here at no cost whatsoever,” he said.-Extensive bureaucratic red tape coupled with transportation, legal costs and opportunity costs of foregone work make the justice system not only physically but also financially unavailable to many Liberians.-Evetta Kesselee, 18, and Patience Dixon, 20, are close friends. They live in the same neighborhood and regularly visited each other.-Not until May this year, when confusion broke out between Evetta and Patience which eventually led to a fist fight. The dual refused to speak to each other. The matter involved a man who seemed to be dating both women at the same time.-Evetta, not satisfied with the enmity between them, complained to a mediator at the Community Justice Team.-The CJT invited the parties and the matter was amicably resolved. “I decided to go to the Center because a friend told me that they can look into (mediate) cases free of charge. If we had gone to the police, we would have been asked to register our case and maybe, transport the officer assigned to make the arrest,” said Evetta.-Patience expressed appreciation to the CJT for the intervention. She and Evetta have re-kindled their friendship through this initiative.-Mediators are carefully selected from within the community representing its demography. They work closely with residents to resolve disputes before they are taken to the police or reach the point of violence.-They also work with local leaders and the Liberia National Police within the area to identify cases that can be referred to the Community Justice Center.-It helps the communities resolve issues in an effective and sustainable manner and builds trust and understanding using the bottom to top approach and contributing to peace and ensuring accountability over time.-The Community Justice Teams (CJTs) are actively working in four densely populated communities in West Point and Logan Town in Montserrado County, Bassa Community in Kakata, Margibi County as well as Demieta / Kokoyah Road in Gbarnga, Bong County.-They are trained by Accountability Lab Liberia with support from UNDP.-Community Justice Teams have been able to mediate over 341 cases in three counties (Montserrado, Margibi & Bong).-On 2 October 2018, the Community Justice Teams and Mediation Centers (CJTs) reported that since the launch of its civil society initiative in 2017, under the UNDP/OHCHR Joint Rule of Law Programme, Accountability Lab-Liberia has established four community justice teams and mediation centers (CJTs) in four densely populated communities in West Point and Logan Town in Montserrado County, Bassa Community in Kakata, Margibi County as well as Kokoyah Road Community in Gbarnga, Bong County.-The four Community Justice Teams (CJTs) have recorded and mediated over 341 minor offenses and community disputes that would have potentially resulted to conflict/violence in those communities.-This method has proven to be effective and sustainable in helping local communities resolve issues without recidivism and build mutual trust and understanding amongst community members that promote sustainable peace and stability.-Working in close collaboration with local community leaders and the Liberia National Police as well as other justice and security actors, the CJTs or mediation centers use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms at a cost-free center to help citizens reach a mutually agreeable solution to end conflict at local community levels before they reach the point of violence or taken to the police and courts.-Established to prevent disputes in local communities, the CJTs are expected to cater to approximately 20,000 local population.-The CJTs partner with local authorities- including the county security/district councils, elders, chiefs and police who have been very receptive and supportive to work with the community justice teams.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgYsfg0QkJY&feature=youtu.be",[],"Governance and peacebuilding,Success Stories"

More importantly, it will provide an important contribution to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, end hunger and poverty, and keep temperature rises below 2 degrees as outlined in the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.-“We must do our best to succeed because our vision is for us to help our people out of poverty and that is our major concern in running of our government. When you are poor, you will live everywhere because you are looking for that aunty, uncle or family member that you think will help you achieve your dream; and by that, you will experience things. For me it is good to live everywhere, living everywhere gives me the sense of experience for development,” President Weah said at the launch of the project at the D. Tweh High School.-Located near the sea’s edge, the entire back fence of the D. Tweh school – along with several neighboring homes – have already fallen into the sea. Now the rising tides are threatening the auditorium and main building. According to President Weah, the government Liberia and partners will do everything in their powers to save the school. With an enrollment of over 1,000 students, the high school is an important public institution in a country with limited health and education infrastructure and resources.-This new project – along with other initiatives including a new project financed by the Green Climate Fund to advance climate change adaptation planning in Liberia – re-affirms UNDP’s commitment to supporting the Government Liberia’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD).-UNDP Liberia Country Director Dr. Pa Lamin Beyai said evidence available so far from the draft of the PAPD Agenda indicates that tackling environmental and climate change issues will form an integral part of the Government of Liberia’s development priorities, as well as their Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement.-“UNDP stands ready to work with the government and other development partners in supporting these and other priority interventions,” Dr. Beyai said at the launch of the project.-“The problem is getting worse by the day, and is compounded by the global climate change, rising and stronger sea waves, increasing storms, sea-surges, and human-made destruction of existing beach fronts through illegal sand-mining, and unconventional fishing practices...All of these have significant negative impacts on the daily lives and livelihoods of the people living along the coast,” said Dr. Beyai.-New Kru Town has a population of over 20,000 inhabitants, and along with the high school, hosts the second Government referral health facility in Montserrado County – the Redemption Hospital.-Based on findings from a technical assessment conducted by the Coastal Project Management Team – formally known as the “Enhancing Resilience Of Liberia Montserrado County Vulnerable Coastal Areas To Climate Change Risks II Project”– holistic, sustainable, low-cost and effective interventions are imperative to dealing with coastal erosion here.-Engineers are working to build protective seawalls and revetments to mitigate the situation. The project is also building drainages, constructing docking areas for the fishing communities, improving waste management and beach restoration, and working with local communities to ensure no one is left behind in the government’s efforts to ensure low-carbon climate-resilient development.-The Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy, in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is responsible for the procurement of equipment, rocks, geo-fabric mats, and the services of temporary staff, while as a key implementation partner, UNDP is in charge of hiring the core project staff, including an international coastal engineer; who has completed baseline surveys and recommended appropriate project designs.-During the launch, the Minister of Lands, Mines and Energy, Gesler E. Murray, said the project will also construct a approximately 1200-meter revetment, also known as sea wall, to control the effect of sea erosion along the New Kru Town coastline. Minister Murray said Liberia’s coastal zones are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, adding “we must undertake necessary measures towards prevention and adaptation.”-To mainstream and accelerate the impacts of these projects, UNDP in close collaboration with the EPA will shortly undertake a comprehensive baseline study of the coast of Monrovia for a “Monrovia Metropolitan Climate Resilience Project” project proposal for the Green Climate Fund.

Many disputes can be resolved in the community.-These Mediators are well known in Logan Town, often going door to door to raise awareness and make sure everyone knows who they are and what they do.-This allows the court to allot more time and resources to process more serious cases, taking the stress off the formal Justice system, while also saving people in the community time and money they don’t often have.-John says the total cost to resolve the case going through the formal system is not less than $150US dollars.-“The cost associated with it is very high, considering that our people live below less than 2.00 a day. We appreciate the support of partners Sweden, Accountability Lab, Irish Aid and UNDP.

One week was even unbearable for me, so I had to do something fast. I tried other options and no way, so Citizens’ Bureau came and helped me out. I am so happy about that and today, my home is going perfect.-According to Christina Cummings, Chairperson of the Logan Town Women’s Group, the ADR mechanism has also helped vulnerable women improve their lives at home.-“Sometimes we get problems like persistent non-support, domestic abuse against women, etc. When this office was not here, we would normally go to the police and they will handle it. But since this is the community peace forum, we come here and we get the same redress. So we work hand in hand” intimated Cummings.-The ADR mechanism is also in Gbarnga and Kakata in Margibi and Bong Counties respectively.-UNDP partners with local organization- Accountability Lab to ensure that residents of these communities take advantage of the services.-Anthony Selma, Chief Operating Officer of Accountability Lab says people are beginning to see the ADR as a way of finding Justice.-“It’s less expensive, bureaucratic and people are beginning to see it as a model for replication in other communities” emphasized Selmah.-The Centers handle/mitigate misdemeanor cases like disorderly conduct, simple assault, debt, domestic issues, and sometimes boundary disputes.-There are 9 mediators in each location (50% women, 50% men) -1 head mediator and they work closely with law enforcement officers and the District Representative office.-UNDP also provides support to Accountability Lab Liberia to train mediators who form part of the Community Justice Teams (CJTs).-https://youtu.be/b1byqRuvXQs",[],"Governance and peacebuilding,Success Stories"

It did not provide minimum learning requirements, and many parents like me were forced to move our children to schools far from our homes. This cost us a lot of time and effort, "" stated Mr Alharari Wahida, a parent of a student.-""Classrooms were not providing adequate conditions as rainwater was pouring from the cracked roofs in winter. In summer, we were suffocating as the classrooms did not have windows,"" added Mufida. -""Residents of this area built the school by their efforts in 1986. The educational institution was in bad condition. Classrooms were not suitable for studying, and toilets were unhealthy,"" declared Mr. Miftah Ali Al-Shawsh, school's headmaster.

In the evening, the place was dark, and I could not stay longer. My clients, who are largely women and girls, could neither come after sunset, and my income was not significant,'' stated Ms. Aziza El Sahely, a 45-year-old fashion designer and mother of five children.-Years of conflict caused major damage to infrastructure in the city of Benghazi. Essential basic services, including healthcare, education, and the supply of electricity, among others, were interrupted. With peace and stabilization efforts in place, residents began to reopen their businesses. However, those operating in the streets with no streetlights found it hard to grow their businesses as they had to close at sunset.-''I was worried about this situation as I had to pay rent and fulfill some other obligations at home. My business was not growing,'' Aziza added.-''Most customers I deal with are women. After sunset, when the streets were dark, I only had a few customers. They felt insecure,” said Mr. Akram Al-Moghrabi, a resident of the Qatar neighborhood and owner of a flower-dressing and gift-wrapping shop.-Led by national and municipal institutions and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with support from 13 international partners and the Government of Libya, the Stabilization Facility for Libya (SFL) provides rapid response in rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and delivery of essential equipment to municipalities to help improve basic services. An uninterrupted and cost-effective supply of electricity is key for local authorities to ensure security, create opportunities for residents to run their businesses, and boost local economy.-More profitable opportunities for small businesses-To address the issue, SFL installed a total of 24 kilometers of solar streetlights along main streets of the city which used to be dark. Some business owners, however, were reluctant at having the lights installed in front of their businesses.-''We faced certain challenges at the beginning of the project. Some shop owners were against excavation work and installation of those poles in front of their shops as this was affecting the aesthetics of their businesses,'' comments Mr. Imran Hariri, a civic activist in Benghazi. ''Residents living in the area set up a committee which engaged with everyone and ensured that permission was granted to install the poles. Today, we are witnessing more transactions as shops can operate until late at night. The value of real estate has increased in these areas, too,'' he added.-Mr. Osama Al-Kazah, Director of the Projects Office for Benghazi Municipality, stated: ''The solar streetlight project is a great investment that is contributing to enhancing stability in the city and the whole country. The existing public lighting system was insufficient to cover all corners of the city. Solar energy is really a way to address a lack of public streetlights and associated challenges.''-''The situation is now different to what it used to be. The street is now lit up at night, even when there is a power cut in the neighborhood,'' says Mr. Badri Ali, an owner of a barbershop located on one of the streets that benefited from the solar streetlights. Owning a business on this street is now very profitable, and I would encourage young people to start businesses here,'' he added.-''I can now stay in my shop until ten in the evening without fearing about security. This solar powered lighting system is making a significant contribution to the success of my business as more customers are showing up. I have earned many certificates in my area of work, and I am about to share this knowledge with other female fashion designers to help them become self-reliant,'' Aziza concluded.","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Arab states,Libya,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Communities and local development,Sustainable development,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Success Stories,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Electricity networks were cut off, schools and health institutions were damaged and looted, and skilled health workers were forced to evacuate. With the city under continuous offensives, families went seeking refuge elsewhere leaving behind a devastated ghost town.-In 2017, following the end of the conflict in Benghazi, 150 families returned to their homes in Omar Ibn Al-Aas Street in the city centre. Others were hesitant to return with the absence of essential basic services.-In efforts to support the municipality’s revival, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) under the “Resilience4Libya” project supported by the European Union (EU) rehabilitated  the Baghdadi clinic in 2018 to reinstate health services for the 60,000 residents of Benghazi and surrounding towns.--The Baghdadi Clinic in Benghazi before and after its rehabilitation.  Photo: ©UNDP Libya-The Baghdadi Clinic building is a historic Italian infrastructure dating back to the 1940s. The clinic consists of several patient rooms, a laboratory, pharmacy, dental clinic, as well as several specialized health care departments, including internal medicine and urinary tract departments, which receives patients throughout the entire year.--The Baghdadi Clinic today provides comprehensive health services to the community including dentistry. Photo: ©UNDP Libya/ Abdeladeem Ajaj-Mr. Salem Al-Awkali, a nurse at the clinic explains of the former healthcare condition, “We used to work in a small clinic that does not have the capacity to take in many patients. We could not provide quality health services to the community due to the poor state of the infrastructure. With the rehabilitation of the Baghdadi clinic, the space has become adequate and we can provide quality care again to a larger number of people.  We now provide comprehensive health services including nutrition in an accessible and stable environment.”-Mr. Osama Al-Kaza, Director of Projects at the municipality of Benghazi says, “This clinic is one of the oldest clinics in Benghazi and a commemoration of the various societies that passed through this significant geographical area. The rehabilitation of clinics is vital for people to return to their homes in Benghazi, to rebuild and bring life back to the city.”-Rebuilding efforts in the city has allowed for hope to grow amidst the rubble and for people to return and start rebuilding their homes, lives and futures. Dr. Hussam Al-Sharif, Director of the Clinic reiterates, “The rehabilitation of the Baghdadi Clinic played a significant role in bringing back around 1,500 more families to the area.”-Dr. Wafa Al-Aqouri, a dermatologist, says, “At the beginning, the number of patients we were receiving was very low but now we’re seeing more patients come in. We receive about 40 patients at the dermatology clinic every day which is an indication that life is returning to the Omar Ibn Al-Aas Street after years of abandonment.”-Prominent health issues within the community are being caused by continuous exposure to concrete dust. The rubble that still fills the city causes skin diseases including rashes, scabies and in extreme cases skin ulcers, as well as respiratory complications. Thankfully, the clinic has created specialized units, including a dermatology department, to treat the numerous patients who suffer from rubble related diseases.-Dr. Al-Aqouri states, “The rubble that still fills the area causes many skin diseases such as scabies, so we receive patients suffering from this almost every day. It was difficult to provide services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have been doing everything we can to serve the community.”-Salama Amani, a young patient highlights, “I was suffering from rashes on my arms, but thanks to the clinic and Dr. Wafaa Al-Aqouri and other doctors here, they were able to treat it”.-The clinic has also been making efforts to address the community’s priorities and introduce new systems that can ensure that all people receive quality healthcare. Dr. Al-Sharif explains, “We created a new school health services department, which is considered one of its kind in Benghazi.” The school health services department ensures that all students from the district have files at the clinic and encourages them to visit for check-ups. The clinic’s partnership with the school serves to effectively provide health services to students, and acts as a proactive measure to stop resurgence of infectious diseases, as well as raises awareness about the importance of public health.-UNDP’s “Resilience4Libya” with funding from the EU is focusing on helping the municipality of Benghazi bring back essential services to support recovery efforts. In line with these efforts, the project has also rehabilitated several other medical institutions, as well as schools and universities, electrical substations, sports fields including the first Rugby Field in Libya, and public spaces including the Benghazi Corniche.  --Young patients visit the clinic frequently suffering from rubble induced rashes. ©UNDP Libya/ Abdeladeem Ajaj- - ",['Icon of SDG 03'],"Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Communities and local development,Sustainable development,Success Stories,English,Libya"

In 2017, the Sabratha Health Center, located 70 kilometers west of the capital Tripoli, was severely damaged during the conflict.-The center served 210 people from the city of Sabratha and its neighboring towns daily and employed 122 medical personnel before it was damaged by the conflict. With the building no longer functioning, people had to seek alternative healthcare facilities in the area. Public hospitals - which have also been compromised – were subsequently burdened by the influx of new patients seeking health access and could not accommodate all their medical needs. -With the aim of strengthening the capacity of public institutions to improving access to quality basic and social services to the most vulnerable groups in Libya, the United Nation Development Programme’s (UNDP) “Strengthening Local Capacities for Resilience and Recovery” Project, funded by the European Union (EU), rehabilitated the Sabratha Health center. -The renovation included the expansion and recovery of the laboratory, pediatric, emergency, wound treatment and pharmacy facilities. Since the end of the rehabilitation in late 2018 the center has been serving around 400 people daily.-As the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) reached war-torn Libya, the Ministry of Health appointed the newly rehabilitated health center as the main coronavirus response hub for the area.-Mr. Rawad Elshain, Head of Medical Services explains, “This place was suffering from infrastructure deterioration and a significant shortage of equipment and supplies. Through maintenance, its services have now expanded to receive patients that may be affected by coronavirus.”-UNDP also provided equipment such as wheelchairs, examination beds and patient trolleys. 
-The health center administration trained the medical team on the use of newly provided safety and sterilization materials, as well as the prevention measures, they are expected to follow both on-duty and off-duty to response to the coronavirus threats. Hiba Al Sarougi, nurse, says, “we have learned how to take prevention measures to avoid being affected by the coronavirus; we wear the necessary uniforms, masks and gloves, and we make sure to clean and disinfect surfaces frequently.” -Meanwhile, the supporting medical staff are raising awareness among patients who visit the center by providing educational sessions about COVID-19 and sharing good practices they can adopt to protect themselves and their families.-The Monitoring, Investigation and Rapid Response Department, which was created six months after the rehabilitation was completed, is now leading the COVID-19 response in the area. Dr. Saad Ali, Supervisor of the unit explains, “when we have some clues that somebody may be affected by COVID-19, we visit the patient at his house, accompanied by a doctor and health inspector, and take samples to send to the lab in Tripoli. We also take her personal information and recommend self-quarantine measures.”-UNDP with the support of the EU has rehabilitated 10 health facilities across Libya to date, allowing 800,000 people access to quality healthcare services and rapid response to COVID-19 threats. This has contributed to enhanced capacities of Libyan authorities in providing quality essential services in the health sector on the path to achieving the sustainable development goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.-              -The initiatives that UNDP with funds from the EU undertook to support Sabratha’s health sector are part of the “Strengthening Local Capacities for Resilience and Recovery,” a multi-phase, multi-year project which aim is to strengthen the local resilience and recovery mechanisms.-The Phase 1 of the project is implemented in the framework of the programme ""Managing mixed migration flows in Libya through expanding protection space and supporting local socioeconomic development"" financed by the North of Africa Window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The main objective of this programme is to comprehensively reinforce protection and resilience of migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya while supporting an improved migration management along the migration routes in the country.-The second phase of the project is framed within the  “Recovery, Stability and Socio-economic Development of Libya” programme funded by the European Union, through the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa – North Africa Window, and implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Local Governance, Municipalities, UNICEF and Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS). The programme aims at improving living conditions and build resilience among vulnerable populations, including migrants, refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), returnees and host communities.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Coronavirus COVID-19,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Libya,Access and delivery,Success Stories,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

It is an opportunity to highlight the work of volunteers around the world who make a significant contribution to the economic and social development of the community in which they invest their talents and energy.-It is also an opportunity to promote volunteerism, encourage governments to support volunteer efforts and recognize the contribution of volunteers to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the local, national and international levels.-The example of the United Nations Volunteers Programme-The observation is as follows: volunteerism is a valuable tool to stimulate people to engage in development challenges. The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme is inspired by the belief that volunteerism can change the pace and nature of development and the idea that everyone can give their time and energy to improve the lives of millions of others.-Under the aegis of the United Nations Development Programme, UNV seeks global recognition of volunteers contributing to peace and development, ensures the integration of volunteerism into development programmes, and promotes the increasing mobilization of volunteers with diverse profiles.-The role of UNV varies from place to place: they help organize and cover elections, they support humanitarian and peacekeeping projects, they are involved in various social, political or economic development programmes, they make volunteerism a form of mutual support within communities and they provide invaluable added value through their wide range of expertise.-UNV and Sustainable Development Goals-In an era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the relevance of UNV is all the more pronounced. Indeed, UNV's mandate is closely aligned with the global development agenda.-Indeed, volunteer modalities and UNV initiatives are expanding development opportunities. In addition, UNV promotes the recognition of volunteer groups and programmes worldwide and their integration into the post-2015 development agenda. Finally, the creation of volunteer-friendly environments stimulates civic engagement and participation in local governance.-The theme of inclusion-For International Volunteer Day 2019, UNV has chosen to focus on the theme: ""Volunteers for an inclusive future"", highlighting SDG 10 and the pursuit of equality - including inclusion - through volunteerism.-Volunteering offers people, especially those who are often excluded, the opportunity to have a concrete impact on their own lives and to play a constructive role in their communities by giving their time and skills.-UN Volunteers in Mauritius-UN Volunteers play a key role in development by linking institutional and national initiatives, community action and individuals on the ground. They are actively involved in the planning of programmes and projects, in the efforts to carry them out and in the final stages of monitoring and evaluation.-As part of this programme, two volunteers are stationed in Port-Louis, Mauritius. Faisal Shaikh is an Indian UN Volunteer who has been working for the World Health Organization (WHO) since October 2017. As a UNV-International Specialist on health system, his main role is to lead and coordinate the support to improve Health system Strengthening and achieve Universal health coverage. His role focuses on supporting and strengthening national capacities to address key health systems components, covering governance/strategic planning and policy dialogue; access to medicines and health products; health workforce; health financing; health information and service delivery. Specifically, he handles the policies and programme on health and biennium support to MOH on health systems programme of WHO. Some of the work that has been done include undertaking health systems assessment of Mauritius, developing sector strategy plan on heath, developing national policies and strategies on blood safety, developing national health accounts for Mauritius, undertaking capacity building exercise based on need on various aspects of health.-UNV programme is also supporting the mobility of volunteers. Ramatoulaye Moussa Mazou, a native from Niger and  volunteer based in the UNDP office in Madagascar, was made available to the UNDP Mauritius office for a period of four months. As a communications specialist, Ramatoulaye is providing support in the development of communication and partnership strategy, but also in the production of audiovisual media, editorial content and reporting.-Raphaelle Godts works for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Originally from Belgium, she settled in Mauritius a few months ago. She is a support agent for the projects of the Global Maritime Crime Programme in the Indian Ocean. This programme aims to support local actors at each stage of the criminal justice chain. This involves technical, material and infrastructural support at the level of law enforcement, prosecution and detention. Raphaelle Godts is responsible for reviewing the region's legislation for possible reforms, organizing training for coastguards, prosecutors, lawyers and judges, analysing statistical data on maritime crime in the Indian Ocean and developing new project proposals.-International Volunteer Day-Today is not only the UNV day, it is the day of all volunteers who, on the ground and in organizations, whether multilateral, bilateral or national, non-governmental or government-supported, engage in development projects of great concern to them.",[],"Africa,Mauritius,News,Success Stories"

By combining methodologies from natural and social sciences, the Acc Lab intends to both produce data that can be utilized by policy-decision makers, as well as draw in local communities and begin to instill in them knowledge and a sense of accountability regarding human actions that have an impact on erosion.-The Acc Lab sees forecasting erosion as one of the key pillars in urban planning and disaster risk preparedness. In working to strengthen this pillar, and in line with the national Master Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction, we hope to ensure local government and community structures have the correct information to make decisions on territorial planning, capacity building, risk prevention and corrective interventions.- -Driving community ownership of the erosion problem and its solutions
-Community participation is a growing topic of discussion and exploration in risk and disaster management. In the case of subjects like erosion, the argument is that interdisciplinary methods involving local communities can support, and are perhaps becoming essential, to mapping and understanding its extent and causes, which then can be used to implement solutions and preventive measures.-In order to explore this, the Acc Lab Mozambique proposes to bring together technical experts, local government and affected communities to assess, plan, design and eventually implement strategies for erosion reduction and prevention. Along the way, we hope to explore methodologies to scale-up solutions from grass roots and scale down from government institutions and scientific communities in order to enhance cooperation.-Our preliminary research has shown that coordination and knowledge sharing between these 3 stakeholders is critical to developing a deeper awareness of the underlying causes and effects of erosion. In Pemba, some concrete examples of unsuccessful one-sided initiatives were a tree planting campaign along the beachfront that was ineffective after local communities removed the trees for personal use. Similarly, local community’s construction of non-authorized residential and commercial buildings in protected areas leaves vast extents of soil exposed to wind and water erosion, subsequently leaving these same communities in danger.-Building on our assumption that all three stakeholders need to participate, and that community interventions play a key role in landscape restoration, the Acc Lab proposes that this collaborative mapping exercise be used as a steppingstone to understand how community activities can actually be coordinated on the field. In regard to this, we intend to explore questions such as:-·       What partnerships need to be created to ensure projects long term success?-·       What obstacles and opportunities need to be considered to guarantee community participation and ownership of the process?-·       How and to whom should information be disseminated?-·       How to incentivize continuous involvement and application of lessons learnt?- -Designing and implementing a combined methodology-When designing the activity, the Acc Lab combined methodologies from the fields of natural and social sciences. Acknowledging that this is a complex assessment, our layered approach hopes to allocate the appropriate levels of responsibility and complexity to the tasks executed by the various stakeholders.-Datasets from local institutions and international repositories will be evaluated and collated by an erosion specialist, who will also be responsible for designing the methodology to be used by local students and community members collecting erosion related data on the ground. Parallel to this, a local organization will train municipal technical teams and local communities on the use of smart phones and open-source dashboards for mapping and monitoring of erosion in the region. Lastly, a multistakeholder design sprint will serve as an opportunity to map top-down and bottom-up solutions, and explore feasible implementation plans that all parties can commit to.-This multi-pronged approach intends to ensure that the activity both has the scientific rigor needed for the mapping exercise to be used as a reference document, while simultaneously educating local communities on erosion causing factors and monitoring methodologies. In the end, a successful intervention would allow us to deliver the following:-·       creating a database, accessible to both government and civil society, in which the most updated erosion information is displayed.-·       create a mapping activity that simultaneously collects data and educates local communities on causing factors and resulting effects of erosion.-·       develop, alongside local communities and government, small scale interventions with the potential to be scaled up and counteract erosion extent in the region.-Moving forward, and as the activity continues to evolve, we hope to demonstrate how community participation- in this particular case, community mapping- can be an efficient complementary product to scientific planning, thus filling up the current collaboration gap between scientists, communities, and government (policy decision-makers).","['Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Africa,Goal 15  Life on land,Solutions Mapping,Blog post,Goal 13  Climate action,Mozambique,Disaster risk reduction,Success Stories,English,Accelerator Labs"

It was the first time we worked together as a group. When we heard about the contest, we actually had only 72 hours to improve the prototype and business plan. We live in Beira, where we study and work remotely due to our status as students. It was the first time I participated in an equal competition and luckily the first time we won as a group. We've never been so keen to present something like when we were at the Maputo Marketplace.”-The youths from Pro-G, a group of four students from the fourth year of the Computer Engineering course at Zambezi University, developed a solution (BhazaraAqui) that enables the online marketing of Agricultural Products to Sellers within the markets in Maputo city, which has already been delivered to the UEM Innovation Center, one of the UNDP's strategic partners in this initiative.-BhazaraAqui allows sellers to create virtual representations of stalls so that citizens can shop online and receive products without leaving their home. In addition to being able to be installed on Android, iOS and Windows mobile devices and Windows desktop, macOS, linux, the application was designed to reach a universe of more than 1,088,000 inhabitants/residents according to the 2017 census, 63 markets within the city of Maputo and 3,000 sellers within markets.-“The fact that UNDP and its partners have chosen our proposal, greatly valued our work. Winning the hackathon has greatly improved our confidence”, told Kelven Rubalaine.-Pro-G was not the only group that competed for the Maputo Marketplace. The contest involved 50 teams of young programmers and designers from the city of Maputo and Beira who had to strictly follow the six phases of the technological contest.-“Hackathons stimulate knowledge and creativity in young people. We learned that it is not enough for a solution to be a solution, it must be profitable and sustainable so that it does not become a problem”, highlighted André Xerinza, ACS Group.-For André Xerinza, from ACS group, runner-up at Maputo Marketplace Hackathon, “UNDP should continue to support these experiences because they are an opportunity for young people from different areas to meet and develop solutions for concrete needs in rural communities and as you can see, also in urban areas.”-“After our participation in the Maputo Marketplace Hackathon we are no longer the same! Today we have a clear vision of the procedures behind the development of an application or a software. We noticed a great involvement of the competing groups that worked hard to be able to develop a unique model that would solve the posed problem. The implementation of the agile methodology ensured that during the event, the focus was not lost and this has awakened in the team the importance of some aspects that go beyond writing the code, such as the prototyping of the intended solution.”-UNDP, through the “Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Response”, financed the event of a technological nature – the hackathon that took place at the UEM Innovation Space, implemented by the Innovation Space of the Eduardo Mondlane University, with the collaboration of three partners, namely the Maputo Municipal Council (CMM), National Association of Municipalities of Mozambique (ANAMM) and the Commission of Market Sellers.
-“This type of event helps young people to discover their potential beyond the theoretical. It helps young people to challenge their abilities and creativity to bring concrete answers to concrete problems”,  stressed Professor Doctor Luis Neves, Director of the Information Technology Center of the Eduardo Mondlane University (CIUEM).
-According to Professor Doctor Luis Neves, Director of the Information Technology Center of the Eduardo Mondlane University (CIUEM) where the Innovation Center of that University is located, “the partnership with UNDP in this particular initiative was important because it gave young programmers, yet students, the opportunity to show what they have learned in the training and more than that, to carry theoretical knowledge into practice. The advantage of hackathons is that they help young people activate the practical component and challenge young people to add value to their work culture that requires creativity skills, not only technical, but also those of living in a group. Above all, in group work, hackatons raise the need for union, knowledge sharing and information.”-For Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, the origin (university) of the students does not matter. The only thing that matters is that they come with concrete solutions to concrete problems. The University is interested in the entire network resulting from the interaction between students that can evolve into mature and ready-to-use solutions for communities.-UNDP's Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Response supports the government in creating institutional mechanisms to mitigate the risks arising from the pandemic, strengthening the creation of connectivity, the involvement of citizens and the strengthening of local response capacity. All three components are interlinked and aim to enhance government capacity at all levels for emergency, using a comprehensive, information-oriented government approach.-UNDP understands that the Hackathon constituted a space for exchanging experiences, sharing knowledge, with the ultimate objective of contributing to greater effectiveness and efficiency in the supply of agricultural goods and services within the city of Maputo. The Hackathon also aimed to promote the UNDP's commitment to youth, innovation and the establishment of partnerships in a decade of action towards the Sustainable Development Goals.",[],Success Stories

The system help us keep track of the calendar of our activities and servants no longer need to run from office to office to bring and take information regarding the Ministry’s workers. We feel there are mutual benefits, namely, the re-education of paper handling and loss of employee information while increasing efficiency and effectiveness in handling staff information”, cited Engineer Catija Abdula from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).
-With a view to empower the Government following the implementation of the Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Reponse, UNDP hired Dimagi – a social company that offers open source software technology suitable for low-resource environments and underserved communities – to empower the Ministry of Economy and Finance, so that it has data access to base its decisions, allowing coordinated, intersectoral and organizational responses, while using information and communication technology to monitor the performance of subnational governments and central agencies within their domain.
-The installation of the Commcare application at the Ministry of Economy and Finance is included in the UNDP's Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Response which supports the government in creating institutional mechanisms to mitigate the risks arising from the pandemic through the creation of connectivity, the citizens' involvement and in the strengthening of local response capacity.
-“With the Commcare application, the user can select the worker or family member who intends to link acquired information to the health service. Likewise, it can share reports on the performance of workers, such as the frequency of submitted forms, as well as the management of each user's location”, explained Salomao Macuacua, Computer Technician at MEF.-This system can communicate with other implemented systems and contains reports and dashboards that can be accessed both from mobile devices and a web platform and will serve as a data repository that will enable the MEF as well as its senior managers to better understand preparation, progress and problems at their different levels.
-“With the installation of the time book system and control of the health situation of our employees, we reduce the movement of paper information from employees and this helps speed up the search and circulation of important information about employees nationwide. We are working differently. Flexibility in moving processes is another”, highlighted Neila Nhate, IT technician at MEF.

At this moment, there are lots of people in this village, but what happened was that, during the attacks, we fled into the woods and stayed there for six days without water or food. To this day, we're still here and we haven't gone anywhere”, said Mendonça João.-Mendonça, 25 years old, experienced the horrors of the armed conflict and the violence in the Cabo Delgado province of northern Mozambique. Shortly after the attacks on the village by non-State armed groups, she found her home burned along with buildings such as schools, clinics and the local police stations.-Life has been very difficult since then, defined by constant fear, the non-existence of basic services and the complete lack of resources. This reality created a new reality which prompted most residents to leave the area in search of safety, shelter along food and water.-A little over a year later, Mendonça continues rebuilding her life. She is not alone in her story: Many of the 744,000* internally displaced people who fled the conflict areas, some for as long as two years, are slowly starting to voluntarily return to their areas of origin. Although the number of returnees remain limited at this time, it is expected that these numbers will further increase as the security situation improves.-People from Cabo Delgado are currently living in and returning to areas where all infrastructure was destroyed, including buildings which were already damaged by Cyclone Kenneth in 2019, and where the provision of basic public services has yet to resume. - -In areas that were liberated by government forces, the key challenge is to reestablish basic social services such as health, education, and kick-start the local economy to enable people to get back to a normal life as quickly as possible.-UNDP’s Stabilization Programme in northern Mozambique builds on the understanding that rapidly rehabilitating core infrastructures and providing income generation activities along with social cohesion interventions will lay the foundation for increased access for more long-term development to take place. It addresses the urgent needs of civilian populations in terms of essential infrastructure and services, physical security and job creation.-UNDP directly supports local governments through reconstruction of public buildings (schools, clinics, hospitals, administrations), infrastructure repair (street lighting, water points, road access) and cash-for-work activities that bring back basic services to the population and help families gain income as they revitalize their community.-The unconditional cash transfer modality is also used to support women headed households. UNDP is also working to ensure that all interventions are gender sensitive and that women are supported in non-traditional activities such as painting buildings and engaging in small businesses.-The provision of mobile phones as part of the cash-for-work is particularly important as it is enabling women to have access to their own financial resources while developing skills around using the mobile transfer.-Sete Mascote, another survivor of the conflict in Macomia, is using the cash-for-work activities to erase the marks of destruction in his community. -“Here we had nothing to eat, nor clothing. Everything burned, all houses burned. To start these activities, we first organized a group of 30 people, 15 women and 15 men, and received materials so that we could work and clean up the area. Secondly, we came here to the school, cleaned it and painted it too. There were five attacks in the locality and not all residents returned home. But at least for us who are living here, we are already working"", told Mascote.- -Around 700 local vulnerable people of which 50% are women have participated in the activities that consist of cleaning roads, painting school walls and repairing water points in different locations. These immediate economic activities are expanding to other villages of Macomia and Quissanga districts with the aim to reach 2,000 heads of households by mid-November 2021.-Currently, UNDP is supporting the full reconstruction of the Macomia Health Center. Immediate cleanup and minor repairs are underway, including the installation of a generator for light, mainly in the maternity ward where mothers were previously giving birth in the darkness.  - -Catarina Falume, a resident of Macomia who works with the local community and returnees in the district's clean-up activities, supported by UNDP reported:-“I am responsible for the family, but currently the financial life is not good, because we are unstable. There is a lot of running around due to insecurity. There is great value in this activity that we do, because we are putting the area of our hospital with good visibility and hygiene. We hope that our hospital will have the same conditions as before.-When this activity ends, I will produce my cassava again. Because at the end of this activity, I will have some money in my hands.”- -To respond to the urgent needs of both IDPs and host communities, the international community has been mobilizing a large-scale humanitarian response across Cabo Delgado, with more than 800 aid workers from 59 humanitarian organizations, including international and national NGOs, as well as UN entities, for urgent lifesaving and life-supporting activities. As more people move back to their places of origin, the local economy and services will be an essential aspect to make them feel at home again.-Grounded in the Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus, UNDP’s stabilization interventions are meant to lay the foundations for longer-term governance and poverty reduction programmes aimed at addressing the structural issues which have caused very high levels of poverty. Stabilization is the first critical step on the way to building sustainable peace for the hundreds of thousands like Mendonça, Sete and Catarina.- -*IOM, September 2021.",[],"Mozambique,Crisis response,Content type,Success Stories"

The opening of the space was made official on 01 July 2021 at a ceremony led by the President of Mozambique, Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, within the scope of the Government's Five-Year Program 2020-2024 and the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Pharmaceutical Logistics in the country.-The work was carried out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the Ministry of Health (MISAU), within the scope of the ""Strengthening the Health System"" program, with funding from the Global Fund in about 5 million U.S. dollars, having as contractor PANLEEN, Lda; as supervisor of the work CONSULMAR; and as final beneficiary MISAU's Medicines and Medical Articles Center (CMAM).-In respect to identified need for increasing the number of health facilities in Mozambique, according to the 2020 Economic and Social Plan (PES), the Project responds to the Ministry of Health’s key priority in ensuring that the required health infrastructure is constructed and/or rehabilitated, especially in emergency context where is essential for citizens to have guaranteed access and reliability in health prevention, treatment and care services at the different levels.-Particularly in Manica province, the newly constructed Medical Warehouse will allow adequate supply chain management, preventing from stock outs and allowing the citizens of the districts of this province to receive adequate treatment when accessing health centers services. In this context, Mozambique walks towards gaining substantial infrastructure capacity to provide regular and continuous supply of vital and essential medicines and health products to Mozambicans though the National Health System.-The warehouse will introduce greater efficiency and control in the management of medicines and related products, as it replaces smaller warehouses located in the districts and will supply the Health Units directly - which will enable a more strategic, quick and timely stock replacement, taking into account expiration dates and quantity of products shipped, with a mindset to reduce waste and increase safety.-In his speech, during the inauguration ceremony, the President of the Republic, Filipe Nyusi, assured that “the work, built from scratch, includes the provision of modern equipment, with an installed capacity corresponding to a volume of 2,278 m2, making it a reference Medicine and Medical Articles Warehouse in the country. We are pleased to learn that this warehouse can supply directly 72 Health Units in the district of Chimoio and surrounding districts”.-The new facility is the second of its kind already built, of a group of 30 Intermediate Warehouses planned by MISAU-CMAM in the national territory, which will result in the replacement of 11 provincial warehouses and 240 district warehouses.-Principles of inclusion and resilience to climate change were addressed in the warehouse project, which included: Construction in an area of four hectares, with a capacity of 1,620 pallets, including offices, main warehouse, vaccine warehouse equipped with cold rooms, guardhouses, house machines and parking lot; handover of management and operational equipments – forklifts, racks, shelves and others. Additionally, it is equipped with an electronic smoke detection system and other mechanisms, such as a water tank to ensure safety against fires.-The Chimoio Warehouse was also the first to receive a containerized incinerator for its waste treatment system and can work alternatively with renewable fuel, burnt oil, which will significantly reduce maintenance and management costs. Within the scope of the UNDP-MISAU partnership, drawings and technical guidelines for the installation and handling of this mobile incinerator model were developed together with CMAM to facilitate the future training of warehouse personnel. In this context, two other incinerators will also be installed in the provinces of Nampula and Gaza, to support waste management in the northern and southern regions of the country.-“As everyone knows, hospital waste is a danger, so it must be disposed very carefully and safely. According to the World Health Organization, hospital waste is dangerous, contains toxic or radioactive elements and 15% of the volume produced can be infected. Other wastes can cut or perforate and if they are poorly disposed, they can pollute the environment and cause harm to public health. Thus, with the installation and operation of the incinerator in the Intermediate Warehouse in Chimoio, the Ministry of Health will make a better management of pharmaceutical waste, thus contributing to the improvement of the environment and public health”, highlighted the President of Mozambique.-During the work, around 120 masons and artisans were hired, most of them from local communities. The women – who are rarely involved in the civil construction area – were also involved in the gardening and cleaning work to promote their additional family income. Likewise, local leaders were consulted on issues of environmental sustainability of the new space and they conveyed the community's vision that the warehouse represented another step to local development.-“We challenge the managers of this Intermediate Warehouse in Chimoio to adopt the best conservation practices for this heritage, ensuring its permanent preservation and maintenance, and we count on the support of structures in the province of Manica, at different levels”, recalled Nyusi.-Despite the pandemic situation of Covid-19 having impacted most of the civil construction works, UNDP, in coordination with the contractor and the inspection, and collaboration of MISAU (Department of Infrastructure and CMAM), was able to guarantee the Warehouse project delivery within the planned schedule along with ongoing measures to mitigate contamination risks.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Global fund,Health,Press release,Success Stories"

The reopening ceremony took place on 02 July 2021, led by the president of the Municipal Council of Dondo, HE Manuel Virade Chaparica.
-The library revitalization project was prepared and managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in coordination with the Government’s Post-Cyclones Reconstruction Cabinet (GREPOC), financed by the Mozambique Recovery Facility* in MZN 9.3 million (approximately USD 146 thousand), having Minc Constructora as the contractor, and Dondo Municipal Library as the direct beneficiary.  
- -“After cyclone Idai, students stopped coming to the Library because the building was seriously damaged and all the material was destroyed. At first, they felt a lot for having lost a place to study and do consultations. I mobilized and sensitized them to explain that education can change a child's life condition and they can still have a profession,” said Arlista Sebo Inacio Bonde, a teacher for 12 years and director of the Josina Machel Dondo Primary School.
-“COVID-19 brought us a new challenge. A large number of students began to stay outside the closed library, to browse the internet that is installed and which, in a way, helped them to continue their studies from the online classes they were submitted to, as they were unable to afford it at home. In this sense, the library plays a decisive role in the culture and learning of these individuals. It is an added value now that the conditions were also created to comply with the sanitary protocol to tackle COVID-19. The revitalized garden is secured with fence walls and is a pleasant space outdoors, where they can sit and comply with the social distancing”, concluded Bonde.- -Resilience elements are now incorporated into the new and pre-existing structures to withstand future disasters, particularly through reinforced structures and improved roof connection and attachment techniques. Likewise, with the revisions that have been carried out to the electrical, water and sewage system, the Library will be able to return to its regular operations under the health prevention measures.-The main building gained a new coverage area of ​​approximately 114.80m2, and root constructions were made: an entrance porch with access by ramp and stairs, a guardhouse, a fence wall with gates, and public benches – everything in accordance with the current building standards and regulations in Mozambique.-In view to technological modernization, the project also delivered and installed nine computer kits (display, CPU, external HD, accessories), three laptops, three printers, air conditioning and various furniture (tables, chairs and shelves) to the Municipal Library of Dondo. The objective is to offer comprehensive assistance so that it becomes an improved, modern and functional public space, where students and researchers can enjoy it for study and peer learning.- -“Here now there are already many books and we need them. I live near here and intend to come here because I want to learn more. I'll come do my homework and I'll enjoy the computer which we didn't have before, the wifi and the books. Here there was water dropping from the ceiling and it was precarious”, recalled Abel Alface Cheren, 18, a student at Escola Secundária do Dondo.- -Library Reopening Ceremony-The president of the Municipal Council of Dondo, HE Manuel Virade Chaparica, stressed that “a profound rehabilitation of the public library was made; this is an important infrastructure for the students’ learning. (...) We need percipient people for this library to last for a long time. I am assigning the Education Department to select the best employees that we have in the Municipality of Dondo so that they can fill this role carefully”.
-Chaparica convened school principals to hold lectures and visits to the Library in order to encourage more students to attend. “We see the interior of the library with high-ending equipment and all the conditions created so that the child, the youths, the student can feel comfortable and learn all kinds of subjects. I believe that this library will bring many users not only from the city of Dondo, but also from Beira”, he concluded.-On behalf of UNDP, Ghulam Sherani, programme manager of Mozambique Recovery Facility (MRF), highlighted that “this building is not just a place which has been rehabilitated. It is a center of research and education that can shape the future of this town and region and support education and learning to go on”.-Sherani mentioned that the UNDP MRF programme, since its inception in August 2019, assisted about 156,000 vulnerable families in Sofala, Manica and Cabo Delgado provinces in the most cyclone-affected areas.-The district of Dondo has been one of the main focuses of UNDP Recovery Facility where approximately 10,400 families received livelihood assistance, and several constructions are underway: two markets (one already opened); 680 houses with latrines; and two primary schools, each one with two blocks and sanitation.-The executive director of GREPOC, Luis Paulo Mandlate, said that “education is one of the pillars for the development of any country. Although this infrastructure may seem small, its value in what it can produce for people of tomorrow is quite large. We have to ensure that this material, which belongs to all of us, is used by as many people as possible for many years.”
- -*The Mozambique Recovery Facility-Shortly after the cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique in 2019, UNDP set up the Mozambique Recovery Facility (MRF) – a five-year programme in a multi-partner basket fund supported by UNDP core resources, the European Union, Canada, China, India, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway. The MRF deploys both short and long-term recovery activities in cyclone-affected provinces, while it also aims to address underlying vulnerabilities and to build resilience to future disasters. It has three important pillars: (1) help the communities rebuild their livelihoods, especially women and vulnerable groups; (2) rebuild housing and community infrastructure; and (3) develop national capacities and systems to plan and implement the recovery and resilience program.","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Resilient recovery,Goal 13  Climate action,Mozambique,Disaster risk reduction,Press release,Success Stories,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

I worked with agriculture and managed to sell my production but, after Cyclone Idai, I had no money and nowhere to live. I thought of how I could go on with my life and get back to normal”, she recalled.-To start over, Cecília and the seven children moved to Mandruzi resettlement neighborhood, an area granted by the local government to vulnerable displaced families under an urban development plan. “At that time, the important thing for me was to find a safe place where we would have our own land, without having to leave afterwards”, said Cecília, remembering the schools and temporary shelters where they had flee before.-Two years later, the family currently rebuilds a new life, with the support of organizations on the ground. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is building a house for the family and has promoted several income-generating activities for Cecilia, who is the head of the family, through the post-cyclone program Mozambique Recovery Facility (MRF), in coordination with Government’s Reconstruction Cabinet (GREPOC), with funds from the European Union, Canada, China, Finland, India, the Netherlands and Norway.
-For the first time Cecília and her children will live in a cement house, sturdy to withstand climate events, and safe in the rainy season. From the backyard of the old house, she has been following the construction work of the family's new residence since its foundation. “I see the materials they use and there is a lot of difference from our old house. It will also be simpler to maintain hygiene, while in the mud house which has no windows, the dust never ends.”- -Livelihoods to create resilience in future disasters-Despite the trauma she experienced with the cyclones, Cecília remains moved by her responsibility of raising her children and has designed a work routine that enables her to “save money so that the children live more comfortably”. ""I am both their mother and father. I have to work so they don't feel bad because something is missing in their childhood”, Cecília explained.-Cecilia started to accelerate her livelihood recovery in July 2020, when she started to participate in the UNDP Recovery Facility’s cycle of activities focused on women economic empowerment. She has received an agricultural kit (seeds and tools) and a duck rearing kit; participated in village savings and loan associations; engaged in the cleaning of the local drainage ditches through cash-for-work activities; and helped build the community’s waste management center.-The young woman has also received skills trainings on organic fertilizer production (biological charcoal and composting), entrepreneurship and tailoring. These activities were promoted by UNDP MRF to support poverty reduction efforts and reduce disaster risk in vulnerable communities while also encouraging sustainable actions adapted to women's needs. In the future these women can be the multipliers of activities they had learned.-Cecília's participation in economic empowerment activities has energized her life; she has used the tools and new knowledge to keep sustaining her family and as a way to help her community. She has been planting rice, corn and sweet potato in her garden, flowers and other vegetables in the community crops combined with use of biofertilizers. Her ducks also hatched two nests. Amid all this, another milestone from her tireless effort was the completion of her basic education, coincidentally, in the same school that sheltered her family during Cyclone Idai.-Aware of the importance of her community, Cecília concluded: “I would like to mobilize and sensitize other people, neighbors, so that they do not lose hope. Everything is a process. Where there is life, there is hope”.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 1  No poverty,Success Stories,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities"

We are already suffering the consequences as the cyclones have shown. Now we need to have the vision to create alternatives,” said Leonel Machine, 31, from Munhava community, in Beira, one of the cities most affected by cyclone Idai that devastated central Mozambique in March 2019, and, recently, by cyclone Eloise in mid-January 2021.-“We must focus on the production of renewable energy. We cannot continue with fossil fuels. It is a global issue,” said Leonel.-Passionate about innovation, Leonel became interested in renewable energy, particularly in biogas production, through Biology studies at the Pedagogical University of Beira city: “I was the first at my university to be interested in biogas and I started to experiment. At the time, nobody was really interested,” said Leonel. After a few years of research, at the age of 24, Leonel became one of the few technicians specialized in biogas in the country, and started working on biogas production projects in Sofala province.-In 2016, he was hired as a technician by Beira Municipality to manage the production of the new Multifunctional Community Centre for Renewable Energy in Munhava neighbourhood, the first of its kind in Mozambique, where he has been working ever since.-The Munhava community faces major environmental and economic, health and social security challenges; there are limited urban services and few job opportunities for young people and women. For these reasons, the Beira Municipality, the United Nations Program for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) and the BASF Stiftung fund jointly identified the need for solutions to improve the lives of residents in informal settlements, particularly in Munhava.-Through this partnership, the Multifunctional Community Centre for Renewable Energy was built as an example of how infrastructure and public spaces can be resilient while embracing sustainability. In addition, local renewable energy production came as one of the accessible and sustainable solutions for the community to generate energy and income. The centre provides a living space for residents, and has common areas to hold community events, seminars, meetings and weddings, as well as providing shelter in times of emergency.- -Cyclone Idai and the Center’s rehabilitation-The centre was thriving and becoming recognized in biogas production, until the passage of cyclone Idai in 2019 - an unprecedented disaster in the country's history that affected 1.8 million people (PDNA, 2019). An significant portion of the centre was destroyed and the common areas were damaged beyond repair.-“When I arrived at the Center after the cyclone, I lost all my strength. I thought ‘how are we going to continue our work?’. It was a disaster I thought ‘How are we going to continue our work?’” said Leonel.-The house where he lived with his wife, who was 7-months pregnant at the time, and his son and sister, was also severely damaged. “The roof was blown off and the wind tore the stones from the walls of the house. We were very scared. We saw people disappear under the rubble. Honestly, we were waiting for death... It was terrifying. The next day we saw the vast destruction.”-Leonel and his team continued production as best they could, always looking for sustainable solutions to local problems. But they were unable to reconstruct the space by themselves.-It was through rehabilitation work and resilient construction techniques, carried out by the Beira Municipality with the support of UN-Habitat, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government’s Post-Cyclones Reconstruction Cabinet (GREPOC), that the community actively resumed its operations since last year. This resilient rehabilitation has allowed continuity of activities and was not damaged by tropical storm Chalane and cyclone Eloise, occurred recently between December 2020 and January 2021.-Shortly after cyclone Idai, UN-Habitat and UNDP provided technical support to the Municipality for the preparation of the Beira Municipal Recovery and Resilience Plan. In addition, model houses and resilient infrastructures were developed at the national level and locally tested in buildings in Beira; the platform for waste collection and access roads of the municipal garbage dumpsite were rehabilitated.-Through these emergency works carried out by the Government of Mozambique and UN agencies, a significant portion of the cyclone's wreckage was collected and, in the end, processed at the Community Centre for the production of organic charcoal, combining rapid recovery in the scope of humanitarian assistance with the creation of a value chain based on sustainable energy and the resilient reconstruction of Beira city.
-Even after the cyclones, the main activity continued to be the biogas production. For that, Leonel and his team envisioned using organic waste from markets and slaughterhouses in the city that used to be discarded directly into drainage ditches. The envisioned idea has taken off. In addition to enabling the production of sustainable energy, this process helps to reduce pollution, and improves the management of garbage and solid waste, all of which are a significant challenge for the city of Beira.
-Biogas, once produced, is used in community kitchen stoves for the preparation and sale of food and for cooking classes for community members. The centre has involved hundreds of Beira residents in environmentally sustainable and energy efficient activities; Women in vulnerable situations in the community were also trained in the production of organic charcoal to help them create a new source of income and as a more ecological and accessible option.- -The Center and the COVID-19 crisis-Leonel firmly believes that the production of these types of renewable energies is the country's future:-“Biogas and organic charcoal could solve several economic and ecological problems in Mozambique. We cannot waste this resource.”-In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Leonel managed to solve yet another issue: the lack of availability and access to hygiene and cleaning products for the most vulnerable populations. Using the leftovers of fruit discarded in the markets, such as orange and banana peels, available in large quantities, the centre began to produce hundreds of litres of alcohol and bleach, to distribute for free.-The centre's production is currently not-for-profit, and everything produced is donated. But there is potential to expand production and distribution. “We want an investment to guarantee 100% sustainability for the Centre. My dream is to create an automated biogas and charcoal production line that is profitable. We want to turn waste into money, as it is precious material. The production process would employ many people and help the community in an ecological and sustainable way.”-Much has been done; much remains to be done. With the centre rehabilitated, another step was taken to expand the local action led by Leonel and to promote the institutional action of the Municipality of Beira; with the ongoing support of the Government and the United Nations the goal is to grow and increase the number of accessible public spaces and expand the construction of more resilient public infrastructure in other parts of the country.-""I think that every individual has a purpose, has to help solve a problem, and I believe mine is to help solve the energy crisis in rural and urban areas of Mozambique,"" tells Leonel.-The United Nations work in the country is to support many people like Leonel. More resilient buildings, income generation activities, and partnerships to strengthen the government, academic institutions and civil society organizations are some of the examples that enable the continuity and creation of a sustainable value chain - all possible only through direct involvement of local communities.-Leonel also represents the population's wishes for access to energy, and his cause is global: clean and accessible energy – the premise of Sustainable Development Goal number 7 (#SDG7), “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all"". Local climate action is urgent and the United Nations in Mozambique stands with Mozambique to continue to make it a reality across the country.-***-UNDP Recovery Facility-While coordinating directly with the Mozambican Government’s Reconstruction Cabinet to address the human and social aspects of the recovery process, UNDP Recovery Facility has also been working with other UN agencies, among which UN-Habitat,
the International Labor Organization, UN Women, the World Food Programme, and local NGOs, as well as with civil society groups and communities.

The pandemic compelled us to adapt and find alternative ways of providing services to guarantee the continuity of support to service provision for the Mozambican citizens.”-UNDP Resident Representative stressed that “When people do not have access to justice, they risk not seeing their rights fulfilled, they lose economic opportunities, they face discrimination and inequality, they are excluded from the socioeconomic context, and, ultimately, they remain at risk to be left behind. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, while access to justice, as the essence of the rule of law, is the main driver for achieving peace and sustainable development,” Ms. Saidane concluded.-Speaking at the same occasion, Mozambique Minister of Justice, Constitutional and Religious Affairs, H.E. Helena Kida, stated: “With the delivery of this first mobile Court, a pilot phase of a process begins. This will be instrumental for citizens who have to travel long distances to present their petitions, to obtain a trial, to see their legitimate rights respected”.-The Minister hailed the cooperation with UNDP in general and in particular to the support to the justice system saying: “This is one more step in speeding up accessibility to justice services, the reduction of procedural bureaucracy, the reduction of pre-trial detention periods without due process and trials, the granting of conditional liberties, among other benefits. “-“Ensuring access to justice also means taking relevant services where citizens cannot access them because they are not available close to the locations where they live. Mobile Courts are a positive response to the people’s demand of access to justice,” the Minister concluded.  -Mozambique Supreme Court Presiding Judge, Adelino Muchanga, noted that the mobile courts are a major milestone for bringing justice closer to citizens, namely the reclassification of courts and the possibility for citizens to have access to courts located in the areas close to where they live.  “Today we are witnessing yet another milestone. This is revolutionary in the way we approach access to justice, as justice is taken to the reach of all citizens. This is even more important for the needs of the elderly,  pregnant women and people with special needs.”-“How many times are trials postponed and delayed because witnesses were not physically in court because this is too far from them?” Judge Muchanga asked the audience. The new court that we are receiving today is a mechanism for physical access to justice. Citizens cannot be compelled to travel and incur major costs and other inconveniences to access justice services,” the Judge concluded.-The mobile court is part of a joint initiative UNDP – Ministry of Justice, Constitutional and Religious developed in the context of the Project “Strengthening Access to Justice and Human Rights Protection 2018-2021” which strives to promote access to justice and to shorten distances between justice services and the most vulnerable people. - -Unequal access to justice generates socio-economic inequalities, exacerbates poverty and grievances, enhances discrimination and stigmatization which are obstacles to the observance of human rights. Access to justice and protection of human rights are by their very nature key drivers and an accelerator for the Sustainable Development (SDG) Agenda 2030.-In Mozambique, with nearly 60% of the population living in remote areas, where justice institutions are at their least, and 46% living below the poverty line, access to justice to a large part of the population strives to see their right to a fast and equitable justice met.  The COVID-19 Pandemic has further enlarged distances and deepened vulnerabilities, exposing the most vulnerable people, including people living in poverty and marginalized women at risk of being left behind. The Mobile Courts is, therefore, a mechanism to address this unequal access to justice.  - - - ",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Mozambique,Access to justice,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,Success Stories"

For the 2019 presidential elections eight people submitted their candidacy, with more than 100,000 signatures in total.- - -Each signature and documentation require cross verification with the citizens database and voter identification registry. Moreover, the process must ensure signatures are not proxy or duplicated for the same candidate or for other candidates. The electoral calendar maintains a strict timeline, allowing only 15 days for the entire process; any delay impacts subsequent run up activities prior to election-day.-In the previous elections, these cumbersome signature verification tasks were manually conducted, increasing the risk of error and performance variation of standard operation resulting in concerns among candidates and stakeholders.-Anticipating the signature verification challenge, the Constitutional Council of Mozambique reached out to UNDP Mozambique in early 2019 to request support to enhance the process.-To facilitate an efficient, transparent and credible electoral process, UNDP established a trilateral partnership with the Constitutional Council and Eduardo Mondlane (EM) University, with a focus on enhancing means to verify signatures of supporters and authenticity of documents filed by the presidential candidates for the nomination process.-Experts from EM University were engaged to develop a software to automate signature verification. UNDP provided technical expertise, guidance in software development, equipment including computers, printers and scanners, and overall support for the process.-Through the expertise of the EM University technical experts, the partnership developed a specific software producing an algorithm used with the voter registry.  The software’s automated process verified scanned signatures and voter ID numbers against those in the database, and identified invalid and duplicate entries, to achieve accuracy and efficiency in the verification process. -
- -With the software developed, a vigorous training programme was provided for 50 technical experts from EM University. Once signature packets were submitted, the technical experts worked relentlessly, in two shifts per day, to scan signature sheets, digitize and conduct data entry.  The team overcame the challenge in 10-days, well within the 15-day timeframe, thus giving the Constitutional Council the ability to deliver the decisions on time.-Employing this innovative software to conduct the verification process produced clear and verified results in record time. The dedication of all actors of the trilateral partnership and the relentless efforts of the technical experts met the timeline and expanded transparency for all concerned parties.-“It was a titanic task to complete with very limited timeframe and resources and also scrutinized by everyone involved in this process to finish it on time. The signature verification software sped up the process, enabling staff to efficiently cross-check signatures and voter ID numbers.” Dr. Lúcia Ribeiro, President- Constitution Council -The number of signatures collected by each candidate was clearly quantified through the signature verification software. In the process, four of the eight candidates were disqualified by the Constitutional Council for not obtaining the required number of signatures due to duplications, or listed names not being registered voters.-The unique and innovative first-time experience has enhanced the transparency and credibility of the candidate verification process among stakeholders; the process was certified and accepted by all observer groups, political parties and candidates. The Constitutional Council plans to again use the same software in the next election.-The positive outcome also strengthened the capacity of the Constitutional Council and EM University, anchoring a strong partnership among the highest judiciary body and an academic institution to support the sustainability of this activity for future elections.-Electoral authorities around the world are using new technologies to meet a growing demand for improved transparency and credibility of elections and the electoral processes. This successful Mozambican experience of signature verification provides a positive case study that could inform other electoral candidate and supporters verification processes.- - -For more information please contact: -Andres Del Castillo, Chief Technical Advisor,-Election Project- SEAM, UNDP Mozambique-andres.castillo@undp.org- ",[],"Mozambique,Elections,Success Stories,Democratic dialogue and consultation"

On the Eastern border of Thailand, Mon State has been a regular transit point for tens of thousands of Myanmar migrant workers, moving in and out of Thailand. But since May this year that border traffic took a new and dangerous turn. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, the numbers of infected workers returning home from Thailand kept rising, further spreading the virus. -The impact of virus has tested the state’s public healthcare system. Quarantine centers are swamped, medical personnel overworked, and numerous townships and areas have been placed under ‘stay at home’ measures. According to the latest figures from the government, there are nearly 1,800 patients, and 12 fatalities, so far.-Unable to cope with the rising numbers of infected people, state authorities have sought assistance from volunteer organizations. The volunteers – many of them young people – assist in transporting individuals suspected of carrying COVID-19 to quarantine centers, and also help with support services.-It is a taxing job, with long hours and it has taken a toll on volunteers. Worse yet, personal protective equipment (PPE), that is essential to do the job, has been in short supply. Being in contact with infected people at border crossings, and medical facilities has put volunteers and medical personnel at risk, resulting in several of them getting infected and having to go into quarantine themselves.-In December, one volunteer, who had been on the job for several months, passed away after a period of illness. As friends and other volunteers mourned his demise on social media one of them posted: “It is the first time a volunteer has died from COVID-19. We need to help our volunteers so that they could help people more effectively without endangering themselves.” Other comments follow suit.-A few weeks before the volunteer died, the need for PPE’s was dire. In late November, volunteer groups had already contacted the UN Development Programme (UNDP) for assistance.-“Some volunteer groups contacted me to ask for PPEs. They said the situation was grave and the assistance urgently needed,” said Ni Ni Lwin, Head of Office, UNDP Office, Mawlamyine. “The volunteer groups bear the brunt of COVID-19 control efforts throughout the state. So, they need PPEs to protect themselves, and they need them urgently,” he added.-To cope with the situation, Mon State has been working with the UN Development Programme, to try to control the spread of the virus through an Awareness Raising and Hygiene Campaign. The campaign reached out to vulnerable communities in the state – Mawlamyine, Thaton and Kyaikhto. It also provided state medical authorities with nearly 17,000 PPE items such as face masks, face shields, surgical gloves, hand gel etc., as well as 136 medical equipment sets including oxygen plants, walk through temperature scanners and ventilators.-

On sunny days it presents stunning vistas, but during the rainy season it is often beset by devastating weather. The narrow coastal land on which it is situated has always been hammered by heavy storms during the monsoon season, often causing massive flooding that damages homes, infrastructure, farms, and plantations.-“Monsoon is the time we are anxious about; it brings rains to our cultivations but too much of it often brings destruction,” said 26-year-old Ma Nway Nway Thet, a native of Kyaung. Her village, 12 miles east of the town of Ye, is one of the most vulnerable to storms and flooding.-Myanmar is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. It ranks second out of 187 countries in the Global Climate Risk Index of countries affected by extreme weather events, over the past two decades. It is vulnerable to a wide range of hazards, including floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis. Mon State is one of the hardest when natural disasters strike. Over the years, it has been hit by a series of floods but 2018 and 2019 were particularly bad, when the state experienced heavy flooding that destroyed homes and plantations.-Nway Nway Thet remembers well the floods of 2019.--“One day in August, the government announced there would be unusually heavy rains, and we were duly  alerted. It rained on and off for a week, and then the floods came,” said Nway Nway Thet. When the streams overflowed, the whole village fled to the monastery compound on high grounds. A number of houses were washed away. In addition, paddy fields and rubber plantations, the mainstay crops of the region, were all destroyed. “It was the worst flood so far,” she added.  -After that flood, people from her village decided that they would no longer be passive in the face of disasters. So, Nway Nway Thet said they formed a committee that would help with response and recovery efforts, following natural disasters. Getting organized was relatively easy. But, the committee, which includes Red Cross volunteers lacked expertise and knowledge about operating procedures, said Nway Nway Thet.-In August this year, her committee and other disaster risk reduction committees from neighboring communities, in Ye Township, were invited to attend disaster risk management training, that was supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), with funding from the Government of Luxembourg.-Mon State’s Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group (DRRWG) working with UNDP developed the three-day training programme that included response and recovery procedures. The training sessions were held in four of the most flood prone townships: Bilin, Paung, Kyaikmaraw and Ye – that include 122 villages and 39 wards.-“We learned all things necessary to implement before, during, and after a disaster. We learned how to select a camp site, to prepare it according to health requirements, and to effectively and safely manage the camp,” said Nway Nway Thet. “We have been doing these things for years on our own, but only now we have learned the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all these issues. SOPs will save us a lot of troubles in future.”-The DRRWG sessions included search and rescue training, the use of global positioning systems (GPS), relief and rehabilitation, emergency communication and coordination, first aid, and recovery assessment and planning. Emergency response kits were also provided to the trainees.-Gender awareness was an integral part of the training, said Ni Ni Lwin, head of UNDP’s Mawlamyine office.  “We worked with our colleagues from the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) to share knowledge on gender equality and other related issues. Our goal during the training sessions was to raise gender awareness among rural communities.”-It has for Nway Nway Thet and her team.

Close to five years ago, tragedy struck Daw Myaing Myaing Than and her family. Back then they were not aware of rural planning and gave it little thought about how it would affect their lives.-Two years later, Daw Myaing’s son-in-law, then 25, was bitten by a snake. Again, due to the poor infrastructure, he got there too late. Daw Myaing recounted sadly: “He was carried to the creek, an hour’s walk away. From there, for two hours, a boat took them along an irrigation ditch, leading them to a small jetty near the town. With another hour-long journey to the hospital by motorbike, he did not reach the hospital in time.”-Daw Myaing’s village Aung Kan Thar lies just nine miles from Thaton. But, for decades, there was no road linking the village and the town. To travel to Thahton, villagers had to take a boat along an irrigation ditch or journey through several villages, both routes taking three to four hours. Daw Myaing says, “in those days, we went to town only when it was absolutely necessary. The lack of a good road left our village underdeveloped. We lived in a sort of secluded world, wishing we had a good road to nearby villages and Thahton. While we were quite near in distance, we were left behind.” More than 5,000 residents of Aung Kan Thar and nearby villages had the same wish.-So, in 2017, when Thaton township authorities began working with UNDP on Township Planning, U Chit Aung, the village administrator from Aung Kan Thar, was an eager participant.-
During the discussions, U Chit Aung proposed a community road connecting Aung Kan Thar and two nearby villages. “My proposal aimed to address the challenges we face in accessing basic services like education and healthcare in our village. Teachers did not stay long in our village, and when we got sick we lacked proper healthcare services. Without a road, we also had no means of quickly evacuating people during natural disasters. When cyclones or floods impacted our village, the necessary goods and services needed to relieve the situation would not arrive fast enough.”-A four-mile-long community road, connecting Aung Kan Thar, Htain Pin and Thone Eain Su villages with Thahton, was made a priority for the township. The project funded by the Government of Switzerland, began construction this January and was completed in March.  -“Now we can reach Thaton in two hours, day and night. The road has brought opportunities for development to our village,” says U Chit Aung. “We now plan to request authorities to use the road to extend electricity to our village.”-“Before, most children’s education ended at 8th grade, now our children can attend higher grades in other places, including in Thaton. Transportation costs have fallen, meaning village shops offer much cheaper prices for basic commodities,” he added.-The nearest community health center is now just a fifteen-minute ride by motorcycle. Accessing basic services has eased considerably and there are now increased opportunities for businesses to grow.-
Ko Ye Htet, a native of Aung Kan Thar, used to work as a seasonal laborer. With the completion of community road, he decided to leave his laborer days behind. He added a side carriage to his motorcycle,  which he now operates as a motorcycle taxi.-“Before the road was built, there would be many days where I had no work. As a result, I would often have to borrow money with very high interest rates to pay for food and services. When the road was built, I began to carry passengers and goods to local villages. As a result, my income has increased considerably. I now earn between 6,000 and 10,000 Kyat every day and I do not have to borrow money for food.” Ko Ye Htet is not alone, many likeminded entrepreneurs are using the road to develop new business opportunities. Now there are 15 trishaws, more than 20 tri-motorcycles, as well as 6 light trucks operating along the road.-Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the community road has become even more vital, with Mon State being the transit point for repatriated migrant workers from Thailand.  Government assistance, including rice, cooking oil and beans, have reached villages, in time; and Aung Kan Thar and other communities can now easily access reproductive health care services for pregnant women and children under five years of age. “It’s all because of this road,” said U Chit Aung.-The Township Democratic Local Governance project aims to support 15 township administrators, 10 in Mon State and five in Bago Region, to provide efficient and effective basic services in an inclusive, accountable and transparent manner, by giving townships much more control over financial expenditures to implement  infrastructure projects. Additionally, through providing technical assistance, the capacities to utilize grants effectively and inclusively within townships have been strengthened. The project has been positioned to support the effective decentralisation of decision making.-Ultimately, the project aims to ensure investment decisions in participating townships are informed by, and more accountable to, a broader and more inclusive range of stakeholders. In doing so, interventions promote and help underpin a stable and peaceful political settlement promoted through local engagement and a stronger social contract between the State and the people.",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,Governance and peacebuilding,Myanmar,Success Stories"

The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded everyone of the need to stip action by communities, private sector and government everywhere to conserve and protect nature and secure the environmental commons. While everyone agrees with this noble objective, finding practical and innovative development solutions to complex every day challenges requires ideation and extraordinary commitment to translate the ideas into action as well as building a catalytic enabling platform to seed, nurture and promote new ideas. Kyaw Zin Hted, one of the winners of the 2019 Hackathon organized by UNDP and Ooredoo Myanmar in the Climate Change thematic category exemplifies this approach. Hted with his innovative idea to develop an app called the Sein Platform has earnestly set out to encourage people, especially youth, to help conserve nature through individual or group actions and synchronizing them to become a movement for nature conservation and climate.-The idea for the innovative app came to Kyaw Zin Hted during a visit to relatives in the countryside some years ago. Along the route, he remembered passing numerous roadside dumps and ponds filled with used plastic bags all the way to the village . it was as a stark reminder of the challenge of increasing plastic pollution. Once buried under the soil, plastics are hard to break down and could remain as solid waste up to 1,000 years. “Over time, cumulatively, these plastic bags degrade soil and make land infertile and unfit for production. In water, they split into tiny pieces and clog waterway and contaminating the environment” Kyaw Zin Hted said.-An undergraduate studying mining at Yangon Institute of Technology, Kyaw Zin Hted has been reading and studying the impact of human technologies on nature, both as an academic study and applying the same to real world challenges, which is his passion. After a trip to the village, he became deeply interested in waste and its sustainable management. In Kyaw Zin’s own words, “ I read numerous documents at the (university) library as well as online about waste management, and how it affects the environment and undermine conservation efforts which could otherwise reduce potential climate change impacts.” He felt compelled to do more. The breakthrough opportunity for him arrived on the scene with the announcement of the 2019 Hackathon, for which he ideated and subsequently created the Sein application as one of the winning apps.-
Kyaw Zin Hted intends to develop an application for the Sein Platform that can be downloaded freely in Google Play Store to mobile phones, making it more accessible. He has already approached the Forest Department which has agreed to provide various seedlings free of charge. And there is more: “We have plans to expand it into a social entrepreneurship and use innovative ways to solve community-based issues and challenges. To promote the campaign, we will reward participants’ action for nature activities with a point system. The acquired points can be rewarded with , say mobile phone top-up cards. We are talking with businesses like Ooredoo Myanmar to participate in our platform/ campaign. We will charge fees for managing their Corporate Social Responsibility campaigns. In this way, the platform will be sustained.”-Looking ahead, Kyaw Zin Hted is optimistic. He says, he foresees the youth taking a leading role in biodiversity conservation and in the fight against climate change. He said, “I appreciate UNDP and its partner organizations for giving the youth the opportunity to voice our ideas and thoughts. The Innovation Hub for SDGs gives us a wider network to develop and implement our ideas.” Referring to the Sein Platform, he added, “ It is the first step, small but easily manageable. We will start this way.”-The Innovation Hub for SDGs is a community space for youths and tech entrepreneurs to showcase innovative ideas to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through digital innovation. It is supported by UNDP and Ooredoo Myanmar.-The Hackathon is a special initiative of UNDP and Ooredoo Myanmar to promote and scale up digital innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the youth in Myanmar.",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,Governance and peacebuilding,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Myanmar,Sustainable development,Success Stories"

She was forced to flee her community Kirikasamma because of the over decade long conflict that resulted in frequent insecurity and destruction across the region. -Hauwa reflects on her experience: -“We left Kirikasamma because our house was burnt to the ground during one of the attacks” she recalled. “As we were trying to leave to Damboa town, we were ambushed again, and my husband suffered a heart attack and regrettably passed away”.-After experiencing the devastating loss of her husband while navigating a challenging journey to seek refuge, Hauwa and her children finally arrived to Damboa town and were allocated a space in the camp. - -Hauwa and her children lived in a small space made with raffia and tampoline, relying mostly on humanitarian aid and support from the local community for food and other day to day needs. The living conditions in the camp have been extremely challenging, with little access to basic amenities as well as frequent flooding and congestion that often cause outbreaks of malaria and cholera. The wellbeing of Hauwa and her children is also limited, with little privacy from others and protection from harsh weather conditions and security threats.-Hauwa explained the conditions of life in camp:-“Life is hard here. We don’t have water or electricity; my children suffer continuously from serious illnesses” she explained. “During the rainy season, the camp becomes flooded, and we live in difficult conditions because the roof of our shelter leaks and our belongings are constantly wet and damp”-Hauwa’s teenage daughter Amina, shares her own experience living in the camp: -“We are grateful to have a place to lay our heads after our house was destroyed, but at the same time, it is not comfortable” Amina shared.  “For example, myself and other young girls normally shower in a remote corner of the camp we created for ourselves just so we can get some privacy but we are often scared for our safety when we do.”-Although going back home to Kirikasamma is not an option just yet for Hauwa and her family, having a decent living space to call home would help ignite a sense of hope that things will return to normal soon.-
- -To respond to these immediate needs of the community, the Nigerian Government, with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and generous contributions from the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, launched stabilization activities aimed to help communities across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States build back better. -Stabilization activities aim to help restore access to basic services, increase security and enable livelihood opportunities for communities that have been impacted and displaced by conflict.-In 2019, Damboa town was selected as one of the communities to receive stabilization support. Included in one of the interventions is the construction of 500 two-bedroom housing units. This is a critical need for both former residents, as well as displaced people who cannot yet return home. It will enable impacted people, like Hauwa, to have a place to live in dignity and begin a new journey towards recovery. -Hauwa and her family were selected as one of the recipients of the new housing units in Damboa. Walking around and admiring her new home, Amina her daughter, was happy to have a functioning and safe space that her family could call their own. As she unpacked her books, she shared:-“I am so happy about our new home. It is very close to my school, and now I no longer have to walk long distances to get to school, which makes me feel safer” she said.” -For Hauwa, this is the first step in being able to restart her life again. As there is still much to be done in the region, stabilization efforts act as a starting point in achieving stability and recovery in the years to come.-As Hauwa proudly stood in her new home, she smiled, “Having a place to call home brings peace and stability, it’s the first step to my family’s recovery”.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 03']","Nigeria,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Featured,Crisis response,News,Success Stories"

She joined the school in 2019 in hopes of earning an education so that one day she can achieve her lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.-Established in 1991, GSSS Uba has been providing quality education to students within Adamawa State, but like most schools in north-east Nigeria, it was destroyed by the decade long conflict that has impacted the region. Students have been forced out of school for months, leaving many without access to education, causing devastating impact on the Uba Hong community.-As peace has slowly started to return to the town, usual activities have begun to increase and GSSS Uba was able to open its doors to students once again. Although it was students and teachers were eager to reopen, the massive destruction from the conflict left conditions that were not conducive for a safe and supportive learning environment.-Ruth was excited to return to school to start pursuing her dream, but the conditions made it difficult for both her and GSSS Uba classmates. She reflected:-“When we returned to school, we had no choice but to continue learning under unpleasant conditions” she said. “During the rainy season we would be forced to find shelter elsewhere due to the depilated roofs, the classrooms were congested, toilets were unhealthy for use, and students fell ill all the time”.-
- -Despite these conditions, the students and teachers did not lose hope. Mr. Yusuf Sharibu, the principal of the school, shared that despite the challenges, the GSSS Uba community remained resilient:  -“The destruction of the school was a hard blow to our education system. Despite these immense challenges, we strived to continue learning and working in the destroyed infrastructure. The students and teachers were uncomfortable, but we had no choice than to continue these critical learning activities”, he said-Aligned with its goal to improve access to quality education in an environment which promotes effective learning outcomes, especially in conflict affected communities, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with support from the Government of Japan successfully completed the renovation of GSSS Uba. The renovation of GSSS Uba means more than fixing infrastructure – it means the delivery of inclusive and quality education while helping to promote sustainable learning opportunities for all.- -Included in the improvement to the school was the rehabilitation of the existing classrooms, library, dormitories, administration block buildings and the provision of a new solar powered water borehole. All renovated buildings were fully furnished and provided with solar power to further enhance the capacities of both the students and teachers. -“Everyone is happy with the renovation; the performance of both the students and teachers have improved greatly” said Mr. Sharibu. “We now have so many students enrolling - about 800 students, 30 teachers and counting!”-The rehabilitation of the school has helped to improve student’s health and safety as well as allowed them more time to focus on their studies.-“My classmates and I now feel more secure when going to school. I no longer have to miss class because of regular health issues, I have more time to spend learning because the facilities work, and my classmates and I are now able to focus on our studies more because we feel safer” Ruth shared. -
-
- -The government of Japan and UNDP have been partnering together to support the recovery of conflict affected communities in north-east Nigeria by restoring and providing access to quality public services such as education, health, water and sanitation to enable their transition to sustainable living and peace.-

Although this process is helping with the return of individuals to their respective homes, the difficulty, trauma and impact of the longstanding conflict has affected many. This development has often challenged the acceptance of returnees by some community members, as some still feel uneasy with their return. -The Peace through Sports Programme is helping people rebuild intercommunal trust, heal from the effects of the conflict, and cultivate tolerance which are all critical components of achieving social cohesion.-Lawan reflected that at first, the returns caused added strife and internal crisis within the community:-“When former NSAGs started returning to Bama, I felt that they didn’t have the right to live in the same community as us and so many others felt the same way” he said. “We refused to have any contact with such individuals”.-With the introduction of football activities in Bama, the community has continued to slowly see a change in perception, helping to build unity and mutual trust among its residents. This has proved the importance of using sports as a tool to create a sense of shared identity and companionship among groups that were once inclined to treat each other with violence and hostility. -
- -Lawan shares that through the football league, his friends and others now have a reason to connect, “We have learned how to engage very well with the surrendered NSAG because we are now teammates that play football together. It has made me realize that they too aren’t so different after all”. -For Lawan, the level of trust and unity that has been formed among residents in the community since the inception of the programme is proof that sports indeed bring people together and can help to promote peace and communal living. -To date, over 15 football teams have been formed across three locations in Borno State, providing a community platform for peace and stability, as well as acting as an important tool to prevent other community members from joining in violent extremist activities in the region. -As he put on his football jersey and prepared for the next game, Yara smiled and shared, “We never thought we could relate so well, but it is happening, and we are happy.

Majority of the water supply in Tofa and Doka came from nearby communities and water vendors, and occasionally from the community leaders when available. This often resulted in conflict between communities who also depend heavily on water for their livelihoods. To address this growing challenge, the Women Farmers Advancement Network (WOFAN), with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), assisted by drilling 2 water solar boreholes with 500,000 litres capacity for both communities. -
-
- -UNDP is working with WOFAN through the Small Grants Project (SGP) to help both communities adapt to climate change, improve their water management and promote sustainable livelihoods. The two communities are the biggest towns in Tofa Local Government Area in Kano State, contributing about 70% of the estimated population of 116,292 in that local government (NBS, 2021).-Boreholes are used to provide safe and clean water from underground and has provided long-term access to hundreds of households within these two communities. The boreholes are solar powered and have a total of 20 outlets each, with 10 outlets for domestic water collection, and another 10 for a mosque to carry out religious obligations. They also assist with irrigation purposes for nearby farms and vegetable gardens, which has also led to reduced dependence on streams and stagnant waters.-These communities have already seen major benefits. For example, with a much shorter walk for water, community members have more time for school, work, and other activities:-
- -“The construction of these boreholes will positively impact years of education by freeing up time that children spend collecting water instead of going to school. It will also reduce the prevalence of disease that can keep them out of school and will contribute to a safe and healthy learning environment”, community leader Garba Wakili said. He also added that it has also reduced the burden of water collection by women and girls over long distances, which has been associated with negative effects on well-being, and a higher risk of gender-based violence. -
- -Through this programme, farmers have also been trained on how to improve rice and groundnut farming, plastic recycling, farm residue briquetting, neem seed production and product commercialization. Two acres of land were provided for cultivating varieties of crops, including vegetable seedlings, tubers, and fruits, using various recyclable materials like tyre, old jute sacs, plastic buckets and calabashes to produce crops that meets family nutritional and medicinal needs of the community. - -
-In addition, youth were also trained at the conservation center in Tofa community on the usage of plastic materials to make drip irrigation which was initially regarded as waste by many in both communities. The training has paved the way for efficient water management and energy conservation, ‘‘We’ve been made to understand that plastics play a major part in our daily lives and the practice of disposing plastics after each use poses a threat to the sustainability our community and environment. Now, we can reuse and recycle these plastics which in turn enables us to generate income that we use to care for ourselves and family” explained Yahaya Mukhtar, a member of the community.-
- -24 groups were supported on savings and thrift schemes. These groups are now saving and providing loans to members to grow their agro-businesses. More market opportunities have also been created through creation of linkages between the groups off-takers and aggregators.-
- -“A lot of positive changes have happened since our community received this borehole, especially for women” shared Umma Ado, women head in Tofa community. “The waterborne and water-related diseases we experienced before have reduced and the trainings held here has helped our community embrace sanitation and hygiene”. -According to Umma, benefits of the project will include improvements in living conditions and public health and will empower girls education and women’s economic activity. “It is my hope that the project will continue to promote community involvement in the management of water and sanitation and include specific measures to enhance women’s participation and voice.”","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 06']","Nigeria,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,In the news,Featured,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Sustainable development,News,Success Stories"

Women and children continue to be the face of the crisis, constituting over 80% of the impacted population and over 85% of new displacements. -The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Support for Early Recovery and Peacebuilding Project in north-east Nigeria, through Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus approach, and generously funded by Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Korea, is aimed at supporting the recovery of these conflict affected communities. This is done through the provision of sustainable livelihood opportunities, revival of essential services and reconstruction of critical infrastructure. -Under the sustainable livelihood aspect of the project, 200 women, youth and men that are returnees who were previously displaced due to the crisis, are engaged in two months of rigorous vocational skill training courses at Mohamet Lawana College of Agriculture (MOLCA) and Ramat Polytechnic Institute in Maiduguri. During the training, they are gaining skills and expertise in poultry production, cattle fattening, tailoring, welding and aluminium fabrication and computer/GSM maintenance. Upon successful graduation, the trainees are provided with a start-up cash grant for the establishment of their businesses, helping them to build back better towards self-sustainability.-Meet some of the beneficiaries from the programme to learn how this training will help communities get back on their feet.- -Rakiya Ibrahim:-Rakiya Ibrahim is a 24-year-old women from Konduga Local Government Area (LGA). Prior to the insurgency, some of Rakiya’s siblings were attending school while others were engaged in various trade that generated income for the family. Rakiya herself specialized in making caps, which her mother then sold in the market. Rakiya and her family were working towards a promising future until the crisis. -“I was a young girl when the crisis started,” Rakiya explained. “The conflict started slowly and gradually spread across Borno state including my LGA. I remember when armed groups would frequently attack our town, and with time, they outnumbered the military and took over our community” Rakiya continued. “People lost their lives, houses, livestock, farmlands, and valuables. We were left with nothing.”-Rakiya was among those nominated by the council chairman of Konduga LGA, to participate in the UNDP vocational skills training supported by Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Korea. “I opted for the poultry management training. So far, I have learned how to brood day-old chicks, formulate and use of various poultry vaccines, as well as produce a schedule for healthy poultry production. I look forward to establishing a model poultry farm and plan on employing people from my community after I graduate” she concluded.- -Usman Mustapha-Usman Mustapha, from Abadam LGA in Borno State, is married with two children. Before the conflict started, his father was a tailor who provided enough support to carter for the family which enabled Usman to focus on his studies. Usman and other community members were living happily until the wake of the insurgency. -Usman reminisces, “Before the crisis, I was fully focused on my education just like my siblings. I aimed to complete graduation and was preparing to work in a public office job. Unfortunately, due to the conflict my dreams were cut short”. -After the insurgents came to Usman’s town, majority of the community residents migrated to IDP camps due to fear of more attacks. Usman’s family fled to Niger Republic and later returned to Maiduguri town. In later attacks in the village, houses, markets, shops and places of worship were destroyed. Farmlands also became restricted form cultivation.-“I received an opportunity to participate in the vocational skill training programme by UNDP with generous funding from Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Korea. I opted for tailoring, and I have learnt how to take measurements, cut and sew materials just in the first month of training programme. I am enjoying the training, and I am sure that I will be able to start my business as professional tailor upon graduation.” Usman Concluded. - ",['Icon of SDG 08'],"Nigeria,In the news,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Featured,News,Sustainable development,Success Stories,Jobs and livelihoods"

When the insurgency began in 2009, Mohammed’s shop was one of the properties that was destroyed. He had to flee the town without warning for his safety.-The crisis in north-east Nigeria has adversely affected many: lives have been lost, jobs and means of livelihoods erased, schools and health centres and markets destroyed, limited access to education and healthcare, leaving millions of people displaced. -Mohammed shared:-“I was doing well as a motorcycle repairer. Even when I was young, I had people working under me; I ran the business and paid salaries. Then the crisis hit. I lost everything: my shop and my equipment. When they attacked, I was in my shop, working on a motorcycle and we had to drop everything and run for safety”- -A number of locations that were once hit hard by the conflict in the north-east are now seeing the gradual return of peace, including Banki. Mohammed and other community members are coming back home and opportunities for running successful businesses have significantly improved.-When Mohammed arrived back in Banki, he found the whole town had been destroyed. People were relying on humanitarian aid to survive - there were no other options.-Despite these challenges, Mohammed wanted to start again. He was able to find that new start in the Support to Reconciliation and Reintegration Project, which is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and funded by the European Union. It helps to build preparedness of the local population to effectively engage in community-based healing and reconciliation, recognizing the link between sustainable livelihoods and transformation from conflict. It focuses on the most vulnerable members of the community, both women and men, and supports skill building while strengthening dialogue between community members and those that are reintegrating. - -The initiative builds on the new realities in the communities. Mohammed is no longer able to work on motorcycles as this means of transportation is not allowed in these locations, but many people in the community are learning new skills and applying them offers renewed opportunities. The initiative has used this process of dialogue and healing to engage 60 women and 39 men in Banki. They each have been supported to identify means of livelihood, aligned with the most viable options in these locations, like receiving basic skills, basic equipment, and support to organize into community cooperatives which now enables them to run their own businesses. Mohammed is one of them, and he has been able to switch from repairing motorcycles to making shoes:-“I chose to learn shoe-making as a new way to support myself. I was trained for 4 weeks, then I could make shoes of any kind!”-Mohammed now wants to give back, by teaching other community members interested in learning from him. He has big plans for opening a shoe factory in Banki, giving jobs to young people thereby helping his community to build back better.

Movement of populations, internal and international displacement across borders have fractured community mechanisms including on dispute resolution. Nonetheless, there is optimism in the face of crisis. Communities recovering from conflict, like those living in Bama town, Borno State, are looking to return and rebuild a better life. -Bama Local Government Area, bordering Cameroon, was once a thriving cross border commercial hub and an important trade route between Cameroon, Nigeria and Chad until it was hit hard by the conflict in the north-east Nigeria. As the military has regained control and the town begins to recover from the devastating conflict, people of different backgrounds have begun to gradually return.-But with many different cultures and views, how can a community recovering from conflict be united once again to live in peace and collectively rebuild?-To promote community cohesion in Bama, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) under the Support to Reconciliation and Reintegration initiative funded by European Union, is strengthening local infrastructures for peace to contribute to effective community transitions from conflict. In Bama, a community-based social cohesion platform was established collaboratively between the State Government and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and it serves in building social unity and local peace.- -The committee works to give a voice and represent views of all community members. Made up of traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth, women, head of IDP camps and other critical peace actors, its main goal is to ensure everyone feels represented and heard, while building unity.-Such platforms in communities open dialogue spaces, within these conversations they build social cohesion, where healing from the trauma of the conflict is being promoted, local disputes, including inter and intra communal are being resolved, difficult dialogues on sensitive topics such as reintegration are beginning to happen.  -Hajja Ali, is a member of Bama’s community platform and plays a critical role in representing the voices and concerns of women and girls: “This platform is providing an avenue where women and girls can voice their issues without holding back. When they bring their issues to me, I carry it to the platform and adequate solutions can be provided”.-As women and girls are often hit hardest in conflict, Hajja uses the platform to address critical issues like security and gender-based violence. Her participation helps to support and expand spaces for women to participate in local decision-making structures that promote peace and stability.-The creation and continuous capacity building of the platform has been a needed development in the town, helping to promote cooperation in the community. Before the platform was established, the community of Bama witnessed many disparities between different groups which has often led to internal conflict.-Hajja reflected, “Personally, I go about the community telling people the importance of living in peace, because dwelling in disunity will delay our development. I’m grateful for this platform, it has really helped all members exchange ideas and through that recommendations which are useful to the community are generated”. -Community cohesion lies at the heart of what makes a safe and strong community. Promoting it through the creation of strong community networks, based on principles of trust and respect for local diversity, nurtures a sense of belonging and confidence inpeople.-This EU supported project enhances stability through the provision of alternatives to violence and enhanced social cohesion and is implemented as a partnership between the UNDP, IOM and UNICEF in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States.",[],"Featured,Nigeria,Crisis response,News,Success Stories"

She was able to provide for her family of four children on her own and was proud to be a role model for women and girls in her community.-When the conflict in the Lake Chad Basin started, Falmata’s town was frequently attacked. Lives were lost, properties destroyed and means to generating income were halted. Thousands of people were displaced, and most of Banki was left in ruins. -Falmata recalls what happened: “I was at home. The insurgents entered the town, destroying properties and using extreme violence towards the community. Everyone tried to run to safety. I carried my kids and we fled to Cameroon, with just the clothes on our backs”.-Falmata witnessed horrific violence, especially to young girls. Her first son and some relatives were abducted by insurgents. To this day, she still doesn’t know what happened to them.-These direct human tragedies are awful enough, but the cost of conflict also includes the compounding effects of lost opportunities. The once-bustling Banki and this area of north-eastern Nigeria have had a ghastly set-back whose effects will be felt for decades to come. - - -Where to start when trying to rebuild?-The Nigerian Government with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and generous contributions from the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom are implementing stabilization activities in an effort to help communities in north-eastern Nigeria build back better. These interventions are providing timely support, with the aim of achieving the stabilization of conflict affected communities, by restoring effective security, improving the delivery of basic services and livelihoods and the revival of the local economy.-In Banki, these measures include the rehabilitation of security facilities, construction of a protection wall, provision of livelihood opportunities through the cash for work activities, provision of business start-up grants, rehabilitation of markets and the construction of learning spaces and children’s recreational centre. -These efforts are working. Banki is beginning to become safer, and the community is starting to return. Falmata and her family have now returned and are living in the IDP camp. Falmata explains what she faced: “When I returned, the town was in ruins. I ran to see my old properties; everything had been burnt to the ground. I was devasted. I did not know where to begin, but I had to be strong and try to provide for my kids.” -Falmata feels safer in the IDP camp, with its new perimeter wall that protects the town from the insurgents. Before the wall, Falmata and her family would sleep in the empty market stalls as they felt safer there than in their own homes. Now, they sleep at home, even feeling safe enough to go out and get water and food even when it gets dark.-She also is a proud member of a new community-level stabilisation committee that gives a voice to women and brings their wisdom to further stabilization work: “Women and girls are hit really hard by conflict. My role is to present their concerns and issues to the committee, where good solutions and recommendations then happen. The committee helps us look out for each other and helps us to highlight the important security issues women and girls face. We’re now working together to rebuild a strong and stable community”.-The Regional Stabilization Facility intervention is laying a long-term recovery path for conflict affected areas. Banki a town once vacated due to insurgency is gradually flowing with human activities once again. As there is still much to be done, the stabilization effort is a starting point in achieving total stability and recovery in years to come. - ",['Icon of SDG 01'],"Nigeria,Goal 1  No poverty,In the news,Orientation,Crisis response,Featured,News,Success Stories,Newsletter"

This next generation of building materials idea was then developed further to become their graduation thesis.-“It started when we met at the university competition in Gaza. We were exploring the possibilities of recycling and turning waste into environmentally friendly products. We started with organic waste, but it was difficult and beyond our abilities. We then decided to try waste glass. It was feasible and produced in large quantities in Gaza,” Mohammed said.-The Gaza Strip produces 45 tons of glass waste on daily basis from the glass factories, food, and bottles. The possibility presented itself and the team saw the need and the opportunity to introduce stone cycling. They decided to work on the glass waste and process it to have a product that resembles the famed Jerusalem bricks that are used for external and internal construction and beautification.-Once the team started examining the How behind turning the idea from research into a product, they became aware of the START initiative that is implemented by UNDP as part of the Path to Economic Recovery and Empowerment: Facilitating Decent Jobs in the Gaza Strip project.-With funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), and in partnership with the University College of Applied Sciences Technology Incubator (UCASTI), UNDP is supporting the establishment of start-ups. Since 2020, 300 young Palestinians from Gaza were trained through the START initiative and 64 start-ups were incubated including Eco-Stone.

She was married twice and was subjected to countless violations during her two marriages. “I ended up alone, sad, trying to regain some of what I lost over the past 32 years of my life,” Alaa said.-“I was married to my first husband and travelled to Saudi Arabia to live there when I was only 17. I did not finish my education and had no resources,” Alaa explains. “He was a good man. We had three children, but his personality was not strong enough to protect me from his controlling family. “I spent 12 years of my life there with no sense of hope – just inferiority and constant psychological violations”. Alaa made the decision to leave Saudi Arabia and go back to Gaza based on a promise by her husband to have her children visit her every summer and talk to them on daily basis.-Alaa tried everything possible to talk to them, she even travelled back to Saudi Arabia to meet them and perform Umra.

Eleven years of financial, physical, and emotional consumption and abuse. He destroyed everything I built. I was alone, depressed, and bankrupt when I decided to ask for a divorce.

Her love for nature was rooted in her newly established business - Flora.-Azza took her first steps to start the business. She studied the market and received a small grant from a local organization to supply the roof with the equipment needed for her plantation business. “I experimented a lot at the beginning.

My homegrown organic Moringa was in demand because of its health benefits,” said Azza. “When studying the market, I noticed that more people are changing their eating habits into healthy ones.

Amer loved his family home, but the poor infrastructure required them to manually empty the sewage cesspit at regular intervals. “The cesspit was very old and not well built. It constantly required us to empty it. The process did not only affect our health and well-being, but was also very exhausting financially”.-Amer is one of the villagers that benefited from the Transboundary Wastewater Management project, implemented by UNDP with support from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The US$6.7 million project targeted six communities in Baqa Al-Sharqieh, Zeita and Nazlat municipalities, benefiting approximately 18,000 people. The communities targeted used cesspits and dumped wastewater into Wadi Abu Nar and surrounding areas, posing significant public health risks and constituting a threat to the shared water aquifer.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Netherlands ,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Water and sanitation,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Sustainable development,Success Stories,English,Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People"

Under the risk of a Covid-19 outbreak, the young men and women working in Palm Media are raising awareness and combating misinformation within the community in response to the pandemic.-“Palm Media was established in 2018” said its founding member Yehia Zain Eldeen. “ We have TV, news and film production agencies. My experience has led me to the idea of establishing a company specialized in the production of digital content in Gaza. We started off with one room and two partners, but now we are renting a flat and have ten employees”.   -After its establishment, the company was incubated through the START incubation programme for creative entrepreneurs who want to establish successful companies. START is being implemented in partnership with the University College of Applied Sciences Incubator (UCASTI) with funds from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Palm Media is one of 18 start-ups incubated during the START project between 2018-2019.-“With US$3,500 we were able to buy a new camera that would facilitate livestreaming. The support provided increased our capital from only US$6,000 to US$30,000 and enabled us to expand our business further”, said Yehia. Palm Media’s business depends on creating and covering activities. They provide a full package; content development from scratch, design, livestreaming, social media and photography. Because of increased demand and the need for alternative filming locations in Gaza, they started building their own studio prior to COVID-19 for inhouse livestreaming and programme recordings.-“Our schedule was fully booked for the month of March, but as soon as the state of emergency was declared due to the pandemic, most of the activities were either cancelled or postponed. We were worried that this would threaten the company’s sustainability”, Yehia added.-Most of the organizations transferred their conferences, meetings and events to virtual sessions under the precautionary measures announced in Gaza. Therefore, the company took the lead in providing livestreaming and interactive services in their studio. They also went further by launching their own show – Rosheta (Prescription). The programme aimed at raising awareness among the community on COVID-19, bringing information on symptoms and prevention as well as interviewing medical staff and sharing their expert opinions. Rosheta’s episodes were not only health related. They covered the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and unemployment in Gaza, media’s role during Covid-19, fighting rumours and misinformation and mitigating their negative impact on people.-When preparing for the episodes, the team’s starting point is the identification of the most needed / relevant topics and drafting the content. This is followed by the marketing and digital production departments packaging the materials for audience consumption and finally livestreaming it through the various platforms, with followers reaching almost half a million.-“We could have been sitting down doing nothing in the face of the pandemic, but we wanted to contribute to our community by helping other organizations continue their work and spreading the word not the virus for life to go on in Gaza,” Yehia added.  -In the face of socio-economic hardships in Gaza, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the partnership between UNDP and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation yielded in job opportunities for over 2,620 youth (40% women) and the establishment of 140 start-ups. With three years of continued support and a US$5.7 million investment, 872 youth joined employability projects in health, education, agriculture, administrative support; 300 youth supported the development of a GIS system in ten municipalities (62,000 building mapped); and  538 young men and women joined TVET trainings, including 198 persons with disabilities.

That is how the idea of Cerati came to life”.-Yafa Abdel Rahim is a 23-year-old Palestinian entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of Cerati, a Palestinian start-up that works to connect university students and fresh graduates with companies in search for young talent.-“After launching Cerati, I started connecting my friends and colleagues with Palestinian companies.

That is when I decided to add trainings and learning resources to Cerati, and to also look for programmes and opportunities to develop my own skills”.-According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, youth constitute about 23 percent of the Palestinian population. The unemployment rate among Palestinian youth reached 45 percent in 2019, and approximately 52% among youth graduates.  -In 2018, Yafa participated in the Youth Leadership Programme (YLP). After attending a number of sessions and participating in trainings and the national competition, she was selected to represent Palestinian youth in the regional forum that took place in Tunisia that year. “That experience helped me open a number of doors as it was my first time presenting Cerati to an international audience. It also provided me with lots of connections from around the Arab world, expanded my knowledge on the Sustainable Development Goals and thinking skills and inspired me to use my energy and expertise to support my community and make real change,” said Yafa. After participating in the YLP, Yafa was invited by the UN to participate in the ECOSOC in New York. She became a youth representative in a number of conferences and forums, and her last participation was in the presence of  66 international ministers.-UNDP’s Youth Leadership Programme (YLP) aims to support and provide innovative young women and men changemakers with the needed tools to make a real impact, and to help them face challenges related to their economic, political and social integration in their societies.

-Saudi Arabia is taking a more active role to enact local policies towards a lower-carbon economy. There is a growing push within the Kingdom to develop and apply clean energy technologies and reduce dependence of the domestic economy on oil consumption. This helps conserve critical oil reserves for future export revenues, while also reducing Saudi Arabia carbon footprint, currently one of the world’s highest. This holds the prospect for the Kingdom to shift in the future from the world’s oil capital, to a global leader and pioneer in clean energy technologies.-As global negotiations continue over a new global climate regime, UNDP’s support in this process has been critical, leading new public-private partnerships to support clean energy technologies, low-emission policies, and new measures for energy efficiency.-UNDP plays a key role in assisting Saudi Arabia with the enabling activities necessary to undertake its commitment under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through its Second National Communication (NSC) Programme.-Specifically, UNDP has mobilized partnership between the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to produce a National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Saudi Arabia’s Second National Communication on Climate Change for submission to the UNFCCC Conference of Parties.-Also, UNDP has partnered with the King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology and lead private sector partners such as Saudi Aramco (the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia) and the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) to increase demand side energy efficiencies in key sectors of the national economy.-UNDP’s National Energy Efficiency Programme (NEEP) supports energy auditing in industrial and commercial sectors, utility load management, setting policies and regulations for residential buildings and energy-consuming efficiency in appliances, improving information exchanges for energy efficiency, promoting energy services and private sector investments and utilization of clean energy technologies.-Based the success of both programmes, the future could well see localization of climate responses into local policy and action at the municipal and establishment of National Energy Efficiency Centre to promote further energy efficiency measures nationwide.",[],"Saudi Arabia,Millennium Development Goals,Environment,Sustainable Development Goals,Success Stories,Energy,Renewable energy"

This just tells you that shortage of matter is not an excuse for not excelling in your work,” she added.-As the programme aims at establishing bilateral relations among youth of both countries and exchange experiences between participants, Rayan believes it is important to have an open mind and heart to accept every person and every culture as it is, “opening up to different cultures can be a life changing experience if you allow it to be.”-The delegation had a unique experience visiting a Maasai village, which is a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people inhabiting Kenya and Northern Tanzania. They are among the best-known local populations due to their distinctive customs and dress, which the delegation had the chance to see.-“It was wonderful to see people in their own environment and surroundings. Although I saw a documentary on the Maasai once, but it was different seeing them in person and see how they live,” Rayan says.-She believes her experience with MoFA and UNDP as a participant with the Saudi International Dialogue Forum is amazing. “I'm glad I was part of such a great team of supervisors, participants and fellow Tanzanians. It was such a friendly cooperative environment. I would do it all over again,” she said. -Although the forum ended, continuous dialogue sessions between Saudi and Tanzanian youth are still taking place where these youth came up with creative initiatives, which can be applied bilaterally and globally. These initiatives will be submitted to related entities through MoFA for follow up and youth-led implementation.- ",[],"Sustainable Development Goals,Saudi Arabia,Youth,Gender equality,Success Stories,Human development report"

For over 20 years, she suffered lower self-esteem while experiencing life as a street beggar.-“Sometimes I was found in the market asking people for alms. The act of street begging came with many phycological challenges, yet my livelihood was defined by beggary. And being a mother of three boys and two girls, my children also suffered their share for being raised by a beggar,” she narrated.-Courtesy of the Joint UNDP/FAO Human Security Project, Mariama is now part of a 65-man cooperative in Gbense Chiefdom and is happy to be among the first group of 15 physically challenged persons who have received training on entrepreneurship and a revolving grant of $800 USD from her cooperative through our implementing partner, SEND Sierra Leone.-Several months after she had received her loan from the cooperative, and when asked about her involvement in the Joint Human Security Project, Mariama, with a gleam of smile, said her livelihood is no longer determined by street begging.-With her grants of $ 300 USD from UNDP, Mariama is now a petty trader who sells assorted items such as palm oil, rice, pepper, and charcoal to her neighborhood - restoring her self-esteem by converting her dwelling into a single bedroom and a business centre.  Her new business goal is to expand her business to the commercial center of Koidu City.-Sahr Brima is a motorcycle mechanic in Manjama, one of the hundreds of young people and part of a 10-member cooperative in Soa Chiefdom who also received support under the Joint Human Security Project. Like Mariama Brima in Gbense Chiefdom, Sarh Brima also received training on entrepreneurship and a revolving grant to expand his business and train other youth, developing a viable ecosystem of young people in a chiefdom once known for civil conflicts and social unrest.
-A few months later, Sahr is now repaying his second loan of $300 to the cooperative after initially accessing his first grant of $ 350 and repaying with 10% interest in six months.-Today Brima is a trainer to four other young people who aspire to earn marketable skills and create jobs for themselves. He has also expanded and equipped his shop with needed tools to provide customers with regular maintenance and repair services.-Mariama and Sahr are also upbeat to be among 900 Village Savings and Loans Association (VSLA) and cooperative members in Soa, Gbense, and Kamara Chiefdoms trained on the establishment of VSLA groups and alternative livelihood options, including relevant techniques needed to provide adequate and continuous leadership over a community loan scheme.-Between November 2021 and May 2022, all 30 VSLA groups in the three chiefdoms have generated $ 15,543 United States Dollars as weekly savings and $12,345 United States Dollars as a social fund. Meanwhile, a total interest of $ 4,444 United States Dollars has also been generated from the revolving grants from all three cooperatives.-In 2020, UNDP and UNFAO in Sierra Leone were awarded funds by the United Nations Human Security Trust to strengthen the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in three remote and conflict-prone chiefdoms of Soa, Gbense & Kamara in Kono District. The Human Security Approach is used to address multi-faced, multidimensional development challenges and vulnerabilities to improve human wellbeing across various sectors in the target communities.-Through our implementing partner, SEND Sierra Leone established thirty VSLA groups and three cooperatives, one cooperative per chiefdom- each with twelve skilled groups, all efforts to promote employment opportunities for women and youth in Kono District, strengthening human security for local economic development.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Africa,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,FAO,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,UNDP,Success Stories,Sierra Leone,English"

His penchant for working in the formal job market began to spiral down quickly as he wandered.-Conteh’s exposure to the job market challenge was not entirely bad. He used his free time to study consumer behavior and maximize markets’ opportunities by deciding to invest his meager resources in an entrepreneurship that created employment for himself and other young people who were equally unemployed and lived below the poverty line.-Conteh had started experimenting and developing his business ideas from a 10-hectare family cashew farm in Bo District, Southern Sierra Leone.-“For six months, I was just experimenting with seedlings of different cashew varieties to understand what works best,” he stated.-Six months after he was identified through UNDP Accelerator Lab’s nationwide grassroots solutions mapping exercise as a high potential innovator, enrolled in a 6-month (July-December 2021) Design and Entrepreneurship Training Programme to build capacity, Ibrahim has developed his passion for changing the narrative of what seems to be a culture of growing and not processing value-added cashew nuts in Africa.-With his newly earned skills from the training courses completed at the Institute of Public Administration Management (IPAM)-University of Sierra Leone and Limkokwing University, Ibrahim is now empowered to own a local cashew nut brand (We Roasted Cashew Nuts) and a registered business company named ‘We Cashew Sierra Leone Ltd.’-“The value for my cashew nut product has doubled the normal value and is far-reaching because I now have the skills to process what is growing locally. That is why I prefer to deshell, package, and brand my cashew nut product before distribution in the market,” he added.-Ibrahim and a team of 10 casual workers buy cashew from local farmers and use their hands to crack the shell, and the testa, peel the kernel that is baked or roasted in salted and non-salted flavors and packaged into branded sachet before distribution into the market. According to Conteh, added value to cashew nuts translates to higher price and profit margin, thereby attracting young people to trade his product and make a decent living, while ensuring zero poverty in Africa, which is the largest producer of cashew nuts.-UNDP is happy to learn that Ibrahim Conteh’s product has made it to the shelves of five big supermarkets in the country’s two biggest cities, including Monoprix, Choithram, and Freetown supermarkets in the capital city.-With a team of casual workers, ‘We Cashew Sierra Leone Ltd.’ has trained five marketers to sell its products along major streets in Freetown and Bo cities.-In a branded functional packaging, ‘We Roasted Cashew Nuts’ has defied many odds and positioned itself by simply adding value to a home-grown product, optimizing unique-selling points in a growing competitive market with an emerging potential to dominate the market.-‘We Cashew Sierra Leone Ltd.’ has secured 150 hectares of land in Yele, Tonkolili District, where Ibrahim and the team want to establish the company’s first cashew farm, providing job opportunities to more young people.-From a business idea borne out of his experience of being unemployed, a startup capital of $350, Ibrahim has set a new target of $10,000, which he hopes to generate in two years from sales and grants opportunities so that he can start his company’s cashew farm that mass produces every three years.-“My newly registered company needs equipment such as nutcracker, cashew kernel peeling machine, baker, cashew nut drying machine, peanut processing machine, and oil extraction machine to scale up,” he furthered.-Conteh’s short-term employment target is to recruit at least one hundred casual workers deployed in different parts of the country to market ‘We Roasted Cashew Nut’ while making a good living for themselves and their families.-‘We Roasted Cashew Nut’ is packaged and branded in 100g, 150g, 250g, and 300g.-Ibrahim is excited to partner with other local businesses.

These two districts were not a place you wanted to be, owing to social unrest, and seeming ashes of fear within and between communities.-“Two and half years after UNDP supported Multi-Stakeholder Platforms launched in Moyamba and Pujehun districts, women, youth, and communities are building bridges of peace and fostering social cohesion. More women have gained access to farmlands for vegetable gardening and rice farming through Grievance Redress Committees,” says Alhaji Mohamed Bawoh, Chairman of Sahn Malen Grievance Redress Committee during the Exit Meeting held in Bo District on 29th March 2022.-Today, the Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (MSPs) and Grievance Redress Committee (GRCs) have brought empathy within and between communities in Malen and Makpele chiefdoms of Pujehun District, and Lower Banta and Upper Banta Chiefdoms in Moyamba. This has established a structure that is now trusted for addressing local conflicts, grievances and empowered grassroots women and youth to dialogue on issues and concerns instead of erecting barricades and causing mayhem and unrest in the community.-For these two districts that share common socio-economic activities, these structures are evidently helping communities and the local leadership (including chiefdom authorities, Section Chiefs, Ward councilors, women, youth, and council stakeholders) to unite, learn and reflect more about peaceful co-existence in their daily engagements.-“Youth involvement in the GRCs and MSPs has empowered me to help others participate and understand why peace matters,” said Vandy B. Kamara, a youth, and the Secretary of Makpele Grievance Redress Committee, Pujehun District. -For Vandy, his participation in the monthly GRC meetings feels like having a support group that listens to the concerns of youth and finds local solutions. “Youth were always at the forefront in erecting road and rail blocks. I don’t know how I could have responded further to the many challenges we had in my Chiefdom if not for my support group,” he posited with the feeling of hope and success as he beamed with a smile.-The active involvement of youth in the GRCs in all four chiefdoms provided a glimpse of their role in the unrest between communities and large-scale investment companies. However, “No one has humbled, taught, or inspired me out of social conflicts and unrests more than the GRC. I am in awe of how youth were brought together with other people that we clashed with- that is what I called an art of peace,” Vandy concluded.-Throughout this intervention, UNDP was particularly concerned about the role of women in mitigating resource-based conflict and delivering key results that contribute to peace and promote social cohesion in all four chiefdoms in Moyamba and Pujehun districts. Forty-five (45) out of one hundred and thirty (130) members of Section Grievance Redress Committees (SGRCs) in Pujehun are women, while Moyamba District has forty-four (44) women out of the one hundred and forty (140) SGRC members.-Over the project’s duration, these women were empowered on governance issues and legal frameworks on human rights, gender, and land rights in Moyamba and Pujehun districts. -“With a set of new skills in advocacy, I was able to mobilize other women to convince the Paramount Chief to lift a ban on female cultural activities which were prohibited because of the social unrest in the Chiefdom,” said Haja Adama Senge, Mammy Queen of Malen Chiefdom and member of the Chiefdom Grievance Redress Committee.-For the Mammy Queen, learned conflict resolution skills have also helped them solve household problems with empathy and understanding, creating another fount of community connection.  -Today, communities in the two districts enjoy improved relations with companies, with no strikes or roadblocks reported since project inception.-Our intervention in Moyamba and Pujehun districts was guided by the assumption that resources-based conflict can only be addressed through the combined effort of many different groups, agencies, and sectors. Central to this outlook was to ensure that communities and stakeholders (including, Paramount and Regent chiefs, Town chiefs, women and youth leaders, members of parliament, civil society ̧, companies and councils’ representatives) are able to work together on a common objective. This multi-stakeholder approach has enhanced local representation, inclusivity, and transparency, contributing to the broader ownership and sustainability of the conflict resolution strategies.-The two districts have found a model of best practices for resolving localized resources-based conflicts in rural communities. Through the Office of the Vice President, with support from implementing partner - Fambul Tok, a “One Fambul Framework” is identified, and a planning process is underway to ensure the establishment of grievance mechanisms in every district.-Courtesy of the UN Peace Building Fund and through the Government of Sierra Leone, UNDP and WFP launched the “Mitigating Localized Resources-Based Conflicts and Increasing Community Resilience” project in 2019 in Pujehun and Moyamba districts. Prior to this project, findings showed that the two districts were characterized by violent social unrest, land conflicts, and overall deteriorating relationships between communities and multinational companies investing in the large-scale agriculture and mining sectors in these communities. The project thus seeks to promote peace and social cohesion in these areas through a combination of peace dialogues, through grievance redress committees and community policing, and by supporting sustainable agriculture as well as the creation of income-generating opportunities for the people.","['Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","WFP,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Success Stories,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

This will be achieved by strengthening the existing regulatory framework on land acquisition and operationalizing this through the strengthening of national, district, chiefdom and community-level mediation and dialogue infrastructure. Support will be provided to affected communities to strengthen agricultural and alternative livelihood sources, including agricultural asset creation activities that empower women and youth with inputs and skills, and gender-transformative technical and vocational training to enable local women and youth to benefit from company employment opportunities. To build the capacity of local institutions, the project will provide support to the Government of Sierra Leone to strengthen policy frameworks, coordination and reporting on the Sierra Leone Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (SLEITI) and Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) for enhanced community and businesses partnerships. The professionalism and integrity of the security sector will be enhanced through training in conflict mediation, human rights and sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to strengthening police and community partnerships. The capacity of targeted private-sector company staff in human rights and gender approaches and livelihood programming will be enhanced.-Background-The large- scale acquisition of land in Sierra Leone by private sector mining and oil palm companies has resulted in the significant loss of farming land for the local population who rely on agricultural production as their main source of income and livelihood. Communities in Pujehun and Moyamba districts in the Southern province have been significantly affected.-In Malen and Makpele chiefdoms in Pujehun District, the palm oil companies of Socfin, a company from Luxemburg and a subsidiary of the French Bolloré group, and Natural Habitat, a Dutch company, together occupy 14,669 hectares of prime farming land. In Moyamba district, the Australian owned rutile mining company Sierra Rutile - the second largest rutile company in the world - has a mining lease at over 56,000 hectares spanning across the three chiefdoms of Bagruwa, and Lower and Upper Banta. In Dasse and Lower and Upper Banta chiefdoms in the same district, the Romanian bauxite (aluminium ore) mining company Vimetco operates a 32,100-hectare mining lease. Rutile and bauxite mining is highly environmentally destructive, contributing to the contamination of water resources, flooding and damaging of lowlands that communities use for agriculture.-The land acquisitions and operations of the four companies have had critical impact on the livelihood of surrounding communities who rely on agricultural production as their livelihood. Most households in Pujehun and Moyamba districts (74 percent and 65 percent respectively) are engaged in farming activities. Farming households require access to large tracts of land as agricultural production in Sierra Leone is characterized by low yields. With companies in Pujehun and Moyamba districts now occupying a considerable share of available arable land, vulnerable farming households are now deprived of access to their primary livelihood. With no alternative livelihoods for communities to support their households, land dispossession by private sector companies has led to intensified food insecurity, vulnerability and conflict.-Communities are increasingly resorting to violence to express their dissatisfaction and seek for redress. In January 2019, clashes between communities and security forces in Pujehun district resulted in two protestors shot dead, 2,500 people displaced, and the Local Member of Parliament and members of the landowner association being arrested, who have subsequently been released on bail. Displaced people took refuge in neighbouring chiefdoms, creating spill-over effects and putting additional pressure on vulnerable host chiefdoms. In Moyamba district, 2018 strike actions (October and December) by Sierra Rutile staff were met by heavy handed responses by security forces. Following these events, the Government formed a technical team that delivered a report with recommendations to the President and Vice-President, In January 2019, nine Sierra Rutile workers were kidnapped by a local secret society and forcefully initiated into their rituals, prompting the Government to ban all secret society activities in the country. This measure, in turn, contributed to triggering the January 2019 violence at Socfin’s estate in Malen Chiefdom, Pujehun District, when security personnel intervened to prevent a forceful initiation, provoking the reaction of villagers and youth who launched an attack against Socfin installations. The use of alleged force by security personnel has been considered as one of the causes of escalation of the conflicts.-Major Achievements:- ",[],"Projects,Sierra Leone,Success Stories,English"

Women in these mining communities also complained about issues related to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), which are mostly rampant because of increased economic activities.-In 2021, UNDP trained and established in the Simiria Chiefdom a Multi-Stakeholder Platform comprising of local, traditional stakeholders, women’s groups, and civil society on the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as on issues related to sexual and gender-based violence. Two months after the training, Mary and seven other women from Tonkolili District representing eight sections in the MSP have now identified themselves as the ‘voices’ of other women in their chiefdom’s Multi-Stakeholder Platform.-They now feel empowered to raise their voices on business and human rights, including the operations of mining companies in their chiefdom, domestic and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), which are issues affecting girls and women as a result of the economic bomb from mining.-These women have moved steps further with their newly acquired skills to embark on community advocacy campaigns to cushion deprivation from basic socio-economic needs.-“Our freedom to express ourselves and right to participate in chiefdom decision-making processes have been enhanced, roads that were neglected for almost five years have been graded, and referral system for survivors of SGBV established,” Mary stated.-Meanwhile, other women in the various constituents have embraced the unwavering leadership of Mary and other female folks in the MSP with positive sentiments. During UNDP’s recent monitoring mission to Tonkolili District, participants and partners expressed upbeat over the new wave of active female involvement in decision-making.   -Mining communities are usually vested with different interests - communities want development and decent jobs and protection of their families; companies want to profit, whereas governments want to create employment for their citizens.- “I am positive that amid all these vested interests, my chiefdom and chiefdom structures have become more responsive to SGBV and human rights issues emanating from a mining prone chiefdom where these concerns have been neglected or marginalized for many years”, said Kadie M. Macauley, another female member of Simiria Chiefdom’s Multi-Stakeholder Platform. -Through our implementing partner, the Community Action for Human Security (CAHsec), Simiria Chiefdom Multi-Stakeholder Platform is an approach that is involving all its chiefdom authorities, including section chiefs, ward councilors, women, youth, and council stakeholders to collectively identify and respond to land governance issues and all matters thereby “leaving no one behind”. This initiative fosters effective stakeholders’ engagement in land tenure and deal negotiations, and sensitizes communities on the operations of mining companies.-In Sierra Leone, like in other African countries, many women are disadvantaged in their access to land and other natural resources. Although national laws dictate that women and men have equal access to land, customary land governance systems often do not allow women to take part in decision-making processes.-Thanks to the MSP, Simiria Chiefdom stakeholders have recognized the current need to translate down to the community context and engendered answers to emerging issues on human rights while doing business in mining communities.-Courtesy of the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, the MSP model was piloted in Moyamba and Pujehun Districts where Grievance Redress Committees (GRCs) were formed and provided opportunities to discuss grievances, seeking stakeholders’ views on how localized resource-based conflict can be resolved locally to minimize tensions. This model seeks to promote peace and social cohesion in these areas through a combination of peace dialogues.

Her customers would never bite their fingers in her makeshift house and tailoring shop. However, a sustained lack of customers during the pandemic crumpled her shop to closure in the face of all odds. This forced her to sell locally produced ‘ginger beer’, a sweetened and usually non-alcoholic beverage, alas, to endure her business shut down and provide for herself.-“I suffered financially but also from lower self-esteem after the business change from being a seamstress to a ginger beer seller,” says Hassanatu.-31-year-old Jacob John is a final year student at the University of Sierra Leone and the owner of Tritech Digital Hub, which he had established to provide printing and photocopy services to schools located in the surrounding communities. Like Hassanatu, Jacob’s business was shut down for three months, the same period when schools were closed. The office space hosting his company was rented through a cooperative. Amidst no coping mechanism, his ability to pay the company’s rent dwindled. Volunteers working at his company were asked to stay home because the company could no longer provide stipends for them.-2020 saw the massive disruption of livelihood opportunities, and many small businesses were not empowered to withstand the shocks of the pandemic. By mid-2021, thousands of small businesses owned by young people were either closed or seriously impacted by Covid-19, leaving them unemployed.  -In response, UNDP Sierra Leone, through its partners Restless Development and Institute of Development and Humanitarian Assistance-IDHA, implemented a quick impact project entitled ‘Stabilization and livelihoods enhancement for COVID-19 affected vulnerable communities in Sierra Leone.’-Aimed at supporting youth businesses which closed or significantly scaled down to restart their operations, the quick impact project provided grants to over 1,000 youth-owned businesses in Western Area Rural and Urban Districts, created alternative livelihoods options coupled with training in entrepreneurship and financial literacy.-Several months later, when asked about UNDP’s quick response to the plight of youth, Jacob, with a ray of smile said,-“Thanks to UNDP, my shop has been renovated and my business has grown from just printing and photocopying services to include stationeries and paid-for marketing services. I have also bought a new colored printer which now earns me an additional $15 weekly.”-Now Jacob has employed 1 full-time staff and 5 volunteers, gradually cascading his new skills to his new team of urban youth.-After receiving her grant like Jacob, Hassanatu’s tailoring shop is open again, restoring her self-esteem in her community with a brand-new sewing machine. Her business worth grew from $ 400 to $ 800 in less than two months, and she employed one staff and paid a rent advance for one year.  Hassanatu considers herself lucky to have received new business skills together with a grant. Her new business goal is to have a tailoring shop in the central business area of Freetown City, beating the pandemic with an alternative livelihood. -This initiative complements the Government of Sierra Leone Response Plan and Quick Action Economic Recovery Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Youth Affairs, UNCDF, National Commission for Social Action (NACSA), Ministry of Social Welfare, Freetown City Council, and APEX Bank Sierra Leone.

With the rising unemployment and under-employment, lack of skills and livelihoods, many young people in Sierra Leone have turned in gangs and cliques that engage in violence, substance abuse, crime, and other vices. Junisa Johnny and Isha Songo from Nongowa Chiefdom in Kenema District together with Santigie B. Koroma from Yoni Chiefdom, and Mohamed B.S Koroma and Abdul L. Bangura from Tonkolili District teamed up and put together lyrics for their Krio tune entitled ‘youth-at-risk.’-Since October 2020, a joint UN project has been working to empower over 418 youth-at-risk in Kenema and Tonkolili districts, including 194 females, to become ambassadors for sustained peace, community resilience and social cohesion. The initiative is implemented by UNDP along with two other UN agencies, government partners and civil society to promote the reintegration of youth-at-risk into their communities and inclusion in decision-making. It provides increased possibilities for their voices to be heard and increases their civic engagement by treating them as social partners; secure sustainable livelihoods, and access prevention and protection services, including counselling on gender-based violence and harmful practices (such as early marriages, drug, alcohol, and substance abuse). One important result of these interventions is the formation of the youth-at-risk Music Band.-Working together, the team that has one female member in the Musical Band composed and recorded the song lyrics to encourage other young people to change their behaviour and transform. -This first composition has been unanimously adopted by young people themselves as the project anthem. The song was also performed at the first ever National Youth Summit in Sierra Leone held early November 2021 in Magburaka Town, Tonkolili District, and received a standing ovation from delegates and guests in the audience.-Through themselves and other project beneficiaries, the band wants to spread a message of hope to youth-at-risk and show that it is possible to transform and meaningfully participate in community and national activities.-“Our song aims to educate other youth-at-risk on what we are learning from the UN project about civic rights and responsibilities. We also want to let stakeholders understand our problems and how we can solve them together,” said Isha Songo, the only female member of the band. -Prior to the launch of the youth-at-risk Project, the band members spent time engaging in activities that created disharmony, leaving them opposed to each other and not able to identify their musical talent. Today, the band members have found a useful way of improving their communities through music. They work on developing and practicing songs. As one of the 194 female beneficiaries of the project and only lady in the band, Ms. Songo wants to be a role model and encourage other girls to make the best of their lives.-“I urge my sisters to change their attitudes and stop using drugs and engaging in prostitution,” Ms. Songo added.-The Band has become a positive influence on project beneficiaries and other youth in the two districts.  At the National Youth Summit, the band’s message was able to reach over 1000 youth who attended the two-day conference from all over the country.  This initial success is the result of ongoing awareness training in civic education, gender-based violence and harmful practices, capacity building of local youth structures, and skills training in agriculture and livelihoods.
-A key focus of UNDP’s work is support for the empowerment of youth and conflict prevention. Working with FAO, UNFPA and national institutions led by the Ministry of Youth Affairs, UNDP contributes to inclusive decision-making and institutional capacity building at the national and local levels.  Through our project entitled “Empowering youth-at-risk as resources for sustaining peace and community resilience in Tonkolili and Kenema districts”, UNDP is working with communities to prevent conflict and promote social cohesion. This is realized through collaboration with four national partners:  Ministry of Youth Affairs; Ministry of Health and Sanitation; National Council for Civic Education (NaCCED); and National Youth Commission (NAYCOM). The project is funded by the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) for two years and works to help improve the lives of vulnerable youth in four chiefdoms in Kenema and Tonkolili districts.-With youth gaining consciousness from these project activities, one can only say that there is light at the end of the tunnel for deprived, marginalised and socially excluded young people in Sierra Leone - the shared objective of the PBF, UN Agencies, the Government and people of Sierra Leone.","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,English,Success Stories"

This theme couldn’t be better suited to the current situation we find ourselves in the world today with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This year UNDP has also introduced a new dimension of inclusivity into the competition for young people with solutions for Assistive Technologies, mainly to support people with disabilities (PWDs). This affirms the inclusive nature of the Social Good Summit.-There were three categories of challenges this year:
-1.              Youth Innovation Competition in Agriculture focuses on innovative solutions to improve agricultural productivity and food systems, while considering the protection of the environment at large. The Awards are gender-based, with a male and female winner and runner-up selected. The winning prize is LE20,000,000, while the runner-up prize (Male and Female categories) is LE10,000,000.-2.              Youth Assistive Technologies for People with Disabilities Innovation Competition focuses on solutions that help or enable people living with disabilities to fulfil their potential. There are Winner and Runner-up Award Prizes given. The winning prize of LE20,000,000; Runner-up prize of LE10,000,000.-3.              Youth Impact Competition seeks to identify young people doing something in their community that has made a difference and a positive impact on people’s lives. This Award aims to identify five successful young people from each region (North, North-West, South, East & West) who will be granted the title of ‘Youth Ambassadors” for 2021. The winning prize for each Ambassador will be LE10,000,000.-Meet the six winners of the Youth Innovation Competition in Agriculture:-Male Star Prize Winner-1.      Benjamin Bockarie (Southern Region)-Male Runner-Up-2.      Yao Aiahson Botton (Eastern Region)-Yao Aiahson Botton’s idea is to produce organic chemical fertilizer from rabbit urine to boost agricultural productivity. This locally produced organic fertilizer will reduce the demand for expensive imported chemical fertilizer.
-Female Runner-Up-4.      Susan S. Sesay (Northern Region)-Susan S. Sesay’s proposed solutions are to produce fresh, nutritious juice, pasteurized juice, and jam using our local fruits and vegetables and create meaningful employment for young women in the process. This will also reduce the wastage of seasonal fruits and vegetables in our communities. The reason for this solution is that agriculture and rural development are two of the best available driving forces for eliminating hunger and poverty and addressing the negative socio-economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this proposed solution would be to engage more youth and women in the agriculture and food system, which will reduce rural-urban migration and stop illegal and distressful international migration in search of a decent standard of living.
-The two prize winners of the Youth Assistive Technologies for People with Disabilities Innovation Competition:-Star Prize Winner-1.      Emmanuel Saati -Emmanuel Saati’s innovation Smart Blind Stick provides blind people with detection and localization of objects to offer those people a sense of the external environment using functions of sensors. The sensors also aid the user with the mobility task based on the objects' dimensions, range, and height. The assistant technology provides fast processing for the exchanged information between a blind person and sensors. For example, the system can detect the obstacle that is 4m in front of a blind person in 30sec.","['Icon of SDG 0', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Sustainable Development Goals,Success Stories,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Mabinty has revived her used-clothing business in her birth town, contributing to the VSLA, and savings from her small “cash box” is offsetting her debt from a high-interest microcredit scheme that almost landed her behind bars before she fled.-Covid-19 negatively impacted the lives of citizens in border communities, especially women traders who are largely the main source of income for their families and contribute to the economic viability of the borderland communities.-Recognizing the shared threat of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly on to the health and economic security of the people of Mano River Union border communities, UNDP is providing further support in a form of seed grants to women traders in border communities to mitigate future shocks from outbreaks and build a shared and holistic recovery post-Covid-19.
-“In such unprecedented times, there are two essential things we can do to support small businesses- mitigate the direst consequences from most vulnerable populations to help slow and reduce the impact of the pandemic, and to give women the tools to realize their potential to run businesses; broadening avenues to contribute to community welfare and economic growth,” said Kadiatu Bachalle Taylor, UNDP’s Gender Analyst.-Tailoring these approaches to specific community circumstances could help save thousands of livelihoods in poor communities and strengthen economies against future shocks while enhancing security and social safety nets, Kadiatu added. -Yata Jagwa has lived in Sulima, Pujehun District for 25 years as a successful fish monger. Over the years, Yata’s fish business grown from Sulima market to Kailahun District in the south, to neighboring Liberia. Her success of doing business was short-lived by the outbreak of Covid-19, inter-district lockdowns and government restrictions on cross border trade. Like any other business, her fish business went through trials and couldn’t withstand the shocks. Yata was left bewildered and despaired. Three months after she had received her $140 grant from UNDP, Yata’s business is up and running again, and this time, backed with trainings on the formation of VSLA groups and sustainable alternative livelihood options including relevant financial management techniques needed to be part of a community loan scheme. Additionally, UNDP has procured 25 solar refrigerators for women fishmongers in Yata’s chiefdom, and vegetable producers in Kambia District to be managed as cooperatives so that these women (fishmongers and vegetable producers) are able to preserve and add value to their fish and vegetable products.-Prone to foreign boats and foreign fishing crew who travelled to fish, UNDP’s intervention to Sulima will benefit its seashores with the installation of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a community need to augment joint-border security and to ease trade. To enhance Personal security of women traders in borderland communities, all 500 women traders will be equipped with solar lamps to enable them (women) trade even at sunsets.   -Influencing negative masculinity-In about 170 countries where UNDP works, we believe that small businesses are the engine that will drive national economies to “build back stronger” during and post Covid-19. Our quick impact intervention in Pujehun and Kambia Districts is also targeting 100 male youth to transform negative masculinity while recognizing the silver linings of men’s involvement to promote equal access and control to resources and improved business environment.-Thanks to funding from the Africa Borderland Initiative and to our Implementing Partner, SEND Sierra Leone.- ","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Success Stories,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

With other dropouts in his birth-district of Kenema, he joined a clique- perpetuating act of gangsterism in the township, and his life continued to spiral downwards.  “Life was all about clique and gangsterism,” Foday affirmed. 34-year-old Daniel Gbani from Tonkolili District lost both parent in 2012 shortly after he had sat to the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), got 7 credits and was ready for enrolment into the University of Sierra Leone (USL). The demise of his parents filled Gbani’s mind with frustration together with very limited opportunity for rural youth, casting a slue to his passion. Unlike Joseph Foday, Gbani moved into volunteerism with the hope of seeking employment after certain period. He volunteered with many institutions in his hometown, but his lack of employable skills left him unemployed. Gbani opted out of volunteerism and started hanging out with ‘ghetto’ boys. Joseph and Gbani live in different regions of the country but have faced similar challenges as youth.-Today, both Joseph and Gbani are part of 60 youth which includes 34 males and 26 females enrolled in UNDP’s funded skills training program (welding department) at the Ernest Bai Koroma University in Northern Sierra Leone.-“I am almost two months old into this training program and now I have realized that I can solve my own problems without involving into gangsterism or any act of violence,” says Joseph, “and I hope to use my welding skills to mentor other young people in my district to help turn their lives around.”-Joseph’s attitude and self-esteem have also greatly improved. With a set a start-up kits which will be provided to the trainees at the end of the course, Joseph is already planning to transform youth gangsterism with his workshop which he intends to establish in his hometown and expand to other districts.-Gbani didn’t leave his passion behind either, UNDP’s latest opportunity to these set of rural youth has motivated Gbani to be a fast learner in the welding program. Gbani is also working hard for what he describes a ‘life-changing experience’ and wants to be an ambassador to other youth in Tonkolili District and beyond. “This training has made me understand the value of life with an employable skill, and given me a sense of purpose,” says Gbani, with a mixed feeling of pain and a sense of hope.-Aminata Bangura, unlike Joseph and Gbani who came from other districts, lives stone throw away from the EBK University where she is enrolled into the soap-making program. As a youth and single parent, she does not feel fulfilled with her current way of survival through petty trading.  She finds inspiration everywhere, but her mind operates on a burning desire to make something, which the UNDP training program has offered. Her primary desire to be part of the soapmaking program is to be able to give a better life to her two young boys while making other people happy through her new skills. -Unemployed graduate youth are not left behind either  -Blessed with a youthful population, with 7 in 10 citizens being below the age of 35, the impact is not only on young people who do not have qualifications, but increasingly, unemployment is common amongst those with diplomas and graduate level qualifications. -31-year-old Esther Mobombor graduated in 2019 with a certificate in Social Work and she comes from Kono District to be part of gara-tie-dying program. For Esther, she opted into the UNDP supported skill training program because her college certificate could not get her a job and now, she wants to learn and do something with her hands, gara-tie-dying being her best fit, which she also believes will give her more voice to raise her 3 children despite her youthfulness. With her new marketing skills, Esther dreams to establish her own gara-tie-dying enterprises to make money and to train other female youth in her district. -Increasingly, employers and policymakers are placing greater emphasis on the development of life and employability skills as a way to prepare young people for success in today’s rapidly changing and globalized world. Building on those competencies helps young people to be motivated, reliable, and confident decision-makers, who are able to overcome adversity and realize their full potentials.-With funds from UNDP Funding Window, the ‘Strengthening Youth meaningful participation in Decision making structures in Sierra Leone’ project was launched in 2020, an initiative that seeks to address the challenges, including capacity gaps, of government and civil society actors, in formulating, implementing and partnering for youth and gender-friendly policies that ensure meaningful youth engagement and contribution in decision-making processes at all levels as well as ensuring the meaningful engagement of youth in skills training and income generating activities.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Asset Properties,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Gender equality,Success Stories"

TVWS harnesses unused spectrum between T.V broadcast bands that can be utilised to provide broadband without interference to the broadcasters. Through this initiative, the SMMEs are providing affordable digital connectivity via wi-fi hotspots to individuals, schools, clinics, taxi ranks, digital hubs, and other public facilities in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern and Western Cape, and the Free State. This initiative forms part of UNDP’s ongoing efforts to advance inclusive growth through entrepreneurship/youth development programmes and extending connectivity to remote areas and vulnerable populations to tackle the digital divide that prevents societies from harnessing the full benefits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can deliver. Songezo Mhambi, CEO of Mdantsane Mobile, is one of the beneficiaries of the UNDP-CSIR initiative and his company is already serving the community in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape. Mdantsane Mobile was established by Songezo in 2019 as a community Wi-Fi network operating from his grandmother’s backroom, selling handwritten Wi-Fi vouchers to neighbours. Songezo shared his story of success as a young entrepreneur thriving in rural Mdantsane.- -Q: Why do you do what you do?-A: I’m not only concerned with just Mdantsane or South Africa being left behind in development, but the entire African continent missing out on yet another industrial revolution as we’ve done in the first three revolutions. I believe the 4th industrial revolution should be Africa’s opportunity to showcase that we have the will and the ability to also play a leading role in the world.- -Q: Why do you think it’s important for citizens residing in townships and villages to have access to reliable internet? What are the current challenges and how is Mdantsane Mobile filling the gap?-A: These are the citizens who are normally deprived of accessing several resources, including exposure to valuable information. That is why internet access is vital to remote areas citizens to have access to all the critical information at their fingertips. As municipalities continue to adopt digitization, residents will begin to manage all their municipal services online, including library material and other things. Even E-commerce is gaining prominence, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. This access and relative opportunities should not only be exclusive to citizens living in urban areas; should the citizen in rural areas and townships be able to access affordable internet, they are likely to benefit way more from doing most day-to-day tasks and running errands virtually online.  - -Q: What kind of support did you receive from UNDP-CSIR?-A: Through the UNDP-CSIR intervention, we were provided with 15 high-performance outdoor Wi-Fi client stations/hotspots equipment. Included was 12 months’ worth of operating capital support for the project. The CSIR also holds some training seminars to assist all participating SMMEs around the areas of business management and technical training around TV White Space technology. -Q: How has your business grown since the introduction to UNDP/CSIR?-A: The 15 hotspots add to the already existing public Wi-Fi network we had been building and has expanded the public wi-fi coverage by 3 times. This means we can reach more subscribers in Mdantsane. This is critical as 70% of Mdantsane’s s close to 200 000 residents had been found to not have adequate access to the internet in the 2011 census report.-Q: Do you think this model is sustainable for your community and what about affordability, with most townships/villages populated with citizens who live below the poverty line, can they afford it?-A: Yes, it is highly sustainable. We cater for a wide range of subscribers. We have prepaid subscribers who make use of our Wi-Fi vouchers which retail from as little as R25 for 1,5GB including R100 for 10GB. Prepaid subscribers can also share data with friends by linking more dives to connect from the same voucher.-We also have our fixed home Wi-Fi which starts at R499 per month for 10 MBPS Uncapped internet. Households pay a once-off installation fee of R999 to be activated and have an internet outdoor dish and indoor Wi-Fi router installed in their home. Other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) charge more than R 2,000 for the installation fee of fixed wireless internet and R 999 for 10 MBPS Uncapped internet per month.-Q: How do you see the internet penetration transforming your community? Any examples of impact?-A: Schools in the area had been struggling with connectivity for years right up to the lack of telephone systems. The internet also presents an opportunity to move the schools’ administration to VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) which requires reliable internet access for the telephone to work. Residents will have more, faster access to valuable information and the ability to search and apply for employment online. Municipal services are beginning to move online with residents being able and encouraged to attend to their municipal account affairs electronically. School pupils are also adopting e-learning along with their educators and, internet access is vital to ensure this digital transition runs moves smoothly so Mdantsane and other townships don’t get left behind in the 4th industrial revolution.-Fast facts about Mdantsane Mobile- -How many people do you employ and how many of them are women?-9 (Nine) employees and 5 (Five) young women.-What are your plans for the future?-We are looking to expand to the rest of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality while deploying small network cells in other provinces to begin building our national footprint.  We are also looking to establish our presence in all major data centres in the next few months from Johannesburg, Durban, to Cape Town. In order to begin peering with other ISPs and content providers who are co-locating at the main data centres.-Who are the greatest consumers?-School children are the biggest users of the prepaid voucher service.

In the context of youth – education, employment and environment – are three of the fifteen fields of action that are considered priority areas by the UN and the international community. While youth empowerment is a global endeavour, the challenges faced by youth in South Africa prevail. As identified by the South African Government, there are several ongoing challenges relating to youth that need immediate action to unleash the full potential of youth in achieving prosperity. These challenges include access to quality of education, job creation, and livelihood opportunities, that are hindering the contribution of youth  in shaping a thriving and sustainable future for South Africa.- -The observation of the UN International Youth Day on 12 August encourages the acknowledgment of the aforementioned issues and the creation of potential solutions. The UNDP maintains an active involvement in devising opportunities for the youth that not only empower them with skills and employment, but also achieves the concurrent goal of promoting an environmentally sustainable economy for the nation too. This year’s international Youth Day is celebrated under the theme “Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health”, as such underpinning the criticality of meaningful participation of young people in climate action, environmental governance and in the economy.- -UNDP and its partners have been supporting the Government of South Africa through empowerment initiatives that create new opportunities to address the triple challenge of poverty, income inequality, and unemployment. These interventions promote better governance, inclusive growth, energy access, climate resilience, and sustainable development. Some examples are the recent collaboration with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) aimed to intensify efforts to reduce youth unemployment, the Technical Vocational Education and Training project to upskill youth with skills relevant to the automotive industry, the and implementation of a Digital Climate, Robotics and STEM project for high-school learners aimed at addressing issues related to climate-related Sustainable Development Goals. Below is an example of an UNDP-led youth intervention in a green sector, namely in the wind energy sector.- -The future of wind energy – experiences from young wind energy technicians-The South African Wind Energy Programme (SAWEP) Phase two is a UNDP-supported multi-year technical assistance project promoting the large-scale commercialisation of wind energy, implemented by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) in close collaboration with the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) and a range of other partners.   Since its inception in 2016 the project has supported policy development and implementation, as well as real impact on the ground in the space of wind energy development in the country.- -The South Africa energy sector largely constitutes of fossil fuels (mainly coal) which has led to country being top 14 greenhouse gas emitter in the world,  and the country is also faced by capacity and supply constraints (mitigated by the so-called load shedding). Even if South Africa has amongst the highest rate of energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa, 9% of the population still remain without access reliable, affordable and sustainable energy – a gap which the SDG 7 goal aims to close by 2030. South Africa is a prime country for renewable energy, especially from solar and wind resources. At the same time, the coal sector employs a large number of people. Therefore, a transition to a low-carbon society with increased use of renewable energy must be just and inclusive, with employment and training opportunities at the core of any strategy, which is recognised by the UNDP and embedded in South Africa’s development priorities. It is therefore key to support education, training and skilling opportunities in renewable energy, a mission which UNDP and its partners have been championing under SAWEP.- -In empowering youth in the green economy in South Africa – in the wind energy sector - UNDP has  teamed up with the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC), a specialised wind training facility under the Department of Higher Education & Training (DHET), residing at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). This support has led to a first cohort of internationally accredited Wind Turbine Energy Technicians (WTST) consisting of 24 young graduates (40% women) from around the country successfully trained through a seven-months accredited programme and absorbed by the South African wind energy market. The WTST qualification is a globally sought-after skill which trains a highly specialised technician to be able to work on a wind turbine undertaking construction, commissioning, maintenance, service, fault-finding and repairs.- -“This support has definitely made a long-term impact in South Africa in terms of the delivery of much needed local technicians for employment in the South African Wind industry as well as the empowerment of individuals to make them marketable for employment and thus contributing towards the ongoing fight against unemployment. The biggest impact is arguably the contribution to reduce South Africa’s ongoing energy constraints as well as combatting Global Warming, said Henk Volschenk, SARETEC Training Supervisor.”- -We interviewed three of the fantastic wind energy technicians, to learn more about their views of the wind technician field and wind energy sector:- -What made you choose to become a wind technician, and what is the best thing about being a wind technician?-“When I visited a wind farm in Molteno, I had an interest in the challenges wind technician face, challenges of working at 100 feet in the air, facing not only electrical challenges but also mechanical, hydraulics and computer skills. As someone who likes challenging herself those challenges appeared joyful to me.“ - Pumeza Tshomela-“At first I was having little information but I wanted to be a part of a big change in energy producing, when I started the training I knew this is where I want to be, the best thing is I am proudly to be one of the female wind technicians.” - Bongiwe Mthethwa-What do you think about the future for renewable energy in South Africa?-“The future is very bright, renewable produce clean energy which is good for environment and it is a solution for energy that is needed in our daily bases.” - Bongiwe Mthethwa-“The future of renewable energy in South Africa is yet to grow and become the most valued source of energy and provide an income in many households.” - Pumeza Tshomela-What advice would you give to other young people that would like to work in the sustainable energy space?-“Work hard and if you planning to go into the wind industry you won't go wrong because it's the future.” - Azra Witbooi-“Sustainable energy is growing fast in our country, if you are a person that's not afraid of heights, challenges and have interest in technical skills this is a career for you.” - Pumeza Tshomela-With more countries, companies, organisations and households turning to renewable energy options as a way to both ensure a reliable and affordable energy supply, and to adhere to necessary climate mitigation action, there is no doubt that the future of wind energy is bright. The Wind Atlas for South Africa (WASA), developed under SAWEP has helped the identification of Renewable Energy Development Zones in South Africa, which in turn supports the implementation of the Integrated Resource Plan 2019 which plans for at least 14.4 GW of new wind and 6 GW of new solar PV capacity by 2030 for South Africa to meet national and international climate targets and net-zero emissions by 2050 as per South Africa’s Low-Emissions Development Strategy.-It is estimated that South Africa will have to train around 1,700 wind technicians over the next years to meet the increasing demand for workers as per South Africa’s current commitments to renewable energy. As the UNDP we are proud to have been working with a great institution like SARETEC under SAWEP, which makes it possible for young aspiring South African’s to create a long-lasting career in a bright green sector, and to share this experience with their families, communities and peers. Institutions like SARETEC are also key in supplying the increasing need of wind energy technicians, and thereby enabling the transition to a sustainable and climate resilient future. Not only in South Africa, but with the opportunity to share knowledge to the continent and the Global South. -Article written by Tove Nordberg and Char Deslandes, UNDP","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,partnerships,Success Stories,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,South Africa,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 13  Climate action,Press release,Topics,English"

This year, the nation celebrates Women’s Month under the theme, “Generation Equality”: Realizing Women’s Rights for an Equal Future”. Empowering women and girls is a common feature in the ongoing work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) towards achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both in South Africa and globally, UNDP efforts have been towards demonstrating commitment to the United Nations (UN) Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most visionary agenda for women’s rights and empowerment everywhere. South Africa is a co-leader of the Generation Equality Forum’s Action Coalition on Economic Justice and Rights, and as such, South Africa is showing strong commitment to contribute to accelerating global efforts to achieve gender equality by 2030, especially advocating for decent work for women and gender-responsive and financially inclusive economies.- -This year we have not only been entering #GenerationEquality, but also #GenerationRestoration: the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration launched on World Environment Day in June 2021. In the same way as gender equality and women’s empowerment is essential to a sustainable world, so is a healthy planet. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration aims to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean. It can help to end poverty, combat climate change and prevent a mass extinction. Restoring our planet will only succeed if everyone plays a part, and in this work, women, youth and vulnerable groups have a special role. This piece elaborates the special role of female-identifying youth in the environment sector, by highlighting three young professionals in South Africa that UNDP has had the privilege to interview and share their views on the future of work in the green economy.- -Gender, Youth and Climate Change-Gender equality, youth unemployment and climate change are all critical development challenges in South Africa. Research predicts that southern Africa is one of the regions hit the hardest by climate change, and in fact South Africa is already experiencing changes that are affecting agricultural and water systems, hence food insecurity, causing environmental degradation and air pollution. All these affect the quality of health, long-term prosperity and security. The issues of gender, age, socio-economic status and climate change are undeniably intersectional.- -Tackling these challenges in tandem, namely through a just transition to an environmentally sustainable society, necessitates a nuanced approach. Climate change has a greater impact on the world’s poorest, vulnerable and most reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods - a burden which in many countries falls on women. Women’s unequal participation in decision-making processes and labour markets also prevent women from fully contributing to climate-related planning, policy-making and implementation. Yet, women play a critical role in responding to climate change at household, community, local as well as at the national and international political level.- -In South Africa, UNDP works with the government and other partners on a range of initiatives aimed at empowering women and youth. Some examples are a recent collaboration with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) aimed to intensify efforts to reduce youth unemployment; implementation of a digital Climate, Robotics and STEM project for high-school learners aimed at addressing issues related to climate-related SDGs; 24 young wind energy technicians (40% women) trained through the cooperation with the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC); and 33 youth ambassadors trained in good community governance practices around Kruger National Park in cooperation with South African National Parks. Another example is the mobilisation of resources from the UNDP Climate Promise for a South Africa based initiative aimed at supporting gender mainstreaming in climate action as a tool for enhanced climate action ambition in relation to ensuring South Africa’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement.- -The SANBI and UNDP Mainstreaming Biodiversity project-Another ongoing example of this commitment is the support to municipalities in developing sustainable and green employment for the nation’s youth in the Mainstreaming Biodiversity into Land-use Regulation and Management at the Municipal Scale project. Simply known as the “Biodiversity and Land Use” (BLU) project, the project is managed by UNDP with funding mobilised from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and is implemented by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and its partners. The BLU project is being implemented in four district municipalities in global biodiversity hotspots and national biodiversity priority areas with very high rates of habitat degradation and conversion, high levels of poverty, and other pressing needs for action: Amathole (Eastern Cape), uMgungundlovu (Kwa-Zulu Natal), and Ehlanzeni (Mpumalanga) District Municipalities are located in the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot; and the Cape Winelands District (Western Cape) Municipality is located between Succulent Karoo and the Cape Floristic Region hotspots. The primary objective is to mitigate multiple threats to biodiversity by working with authorities and landowners to regulate land use and to manage priority biodiversity at the municipal scale. To date, the project has leveraged R325 million for biodiversity activities and contributed to more than 800 jobs.
-    -Another way in which UNDP and SANBI have positively impacted both youth employment and biodiversity conservation efforts is through the work with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEA&DP) in the Western Cape and its Environmental Law Enforcement (ELE) Directorate. Through the BLU project, three interns were trained, who now work as Environmental Officers (EOs) tasked with combating environmental crime that causes threats to biodiversity. This is often done through compliance monitoring and enforcement such as site investigations and inspections, legal assistance, and the establishment and monitoring of rehabilitation programs for alleged offenders.- -UNDP and its partners are keen to share the joys of the initiative, particularly from the perspective of those who experience it first-hand, namely the wonderful young working as EOs. Below will feature the experiences of the three officers; Leigh Kelly, Tashreeqah Sadan and Nokulunga Goqo.- -QUESTION 1: What is your role in the Environmental Crime Unit/ what do you focus on in your work?-Leigh Kelly [26, Mamre, Cape Town, Western Cape]-“I am an Environmental Officer (EO), employed within the DEA&DP, Directorate: ELE, Region 2. Our main function is to investigate matters relating to environmental crimes, in both a reactive and proactive manner, specifically within the Cape Winelands District. We focus primarily on combating the numerous and diverse threats to indigenous vegetation, endangered and critically endangered vegetation through compliance monitoring and enforcement.”- -Tashreeqah Sadan [23, Pelican Heights, Cape Town, Western Cape]- “I am an EO. My main function is to combat environmental crime in both a reactive and proactive manner within the Cape Winelands District Municipality. Focusing specifically on combating the numerous and diverse threats to indigenous vegetation, endangered and critically endangered vegetation within the Cape Winelands District Municipality through compliance monitoring and enforcement. I focus primarily on the administrative enforcement process of NEMA and the SEMA’s[1], i.e. conducting site inspections, drafting pre-notices and notices (Pre-Directive, Pre-Compliance Notice, Compliance & Directive), reviewing representation from Environmental Assessment Practitioners, and attorneys etc.  Representation consists of but is not limited to Rehabilitation Plans.”-Nokulunga Goqo [25, Cape Town, Western Cape]-“I work as an EO for the DEA&DP Directorate: ELE. My main role is to assist Environmental Management Inspectors in combating the numerous and diverse threats to indigenous vegetation, endangered and critically endangered vegetation within the Cape Winelands District Municipality through compliance monitoring and enforcement.”- -QUESTION 2: What made you choose to become an environmental officer, and what is the best thing about your job?-Leigh Kelly “Nature has always been my passion, and I’ve always known that I would want to work within the environmental sector in some way or form. It sounds cliché, but being an EO chose me. Initially I joined the ELE team as a graduate intern employed specifically for the BLU project in collaboration with SANBI. We were granted the opportunity to apply for the EO posts, which I eagerly lunged at, as it was an opportunity to grow within my career. The best thing about my job is being able to partake in site investigations and being in the field, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge, not to mention being able to explore our amazing Cape Winelands landscape whilst doing my job.“-Tashreeqah Sadan “I fell into this career field accidentally. I received a bursary from Cape Peninsula University of Technology which allowed me to study any course offered at the University and Nature Conservation intrigued me. Growing up I had a natural inquisition towards the natural world. I was intrigued by the natural sciences. BBC earth and National Geographic was and still is my favourite tv channels. What I love most about my job is exploring my country and seeing the different and unique biodiversity South Africa has to offer.”-Nokulunga Goqo “Growing up in an industrial development zone of Richards Bay meant I get the first-hand experience on the effects of environmental degradation. As I grew up, I began to realize that the air quality of my hometown was deteriorating at a high rate. As thousands of hectares of Indigenous vegetation got transformed into plantations of exotic species, Rivers, dams, and wetlands that were of important aesthetic value to myself and the community began to dry up. It is then that I decided I wanted to be an EO, so I can actively contribute to aid sustainable development and raise environmental consciousness of the developers as well as the citizens of South Africa. The best part of my job is raising environmental awareness and seeing alleged offenders committing themselves to rehabilitate degraded areas.”-All of the profiled EOs expressed optimism regarding the potential for growth in the environmental sector. Each is confident that new jobs would arise within the booming sector. However, they did note that these new jobs would demand specialised skill sets and therefore may necessitate further education. UNDP is mindful of this, hence why much of our work is not only focused upon job creation but also aims to empower the youth through further education and training. Advice from peers is invaluable, and the advice given by current environmental officers to prospective environmentalists was certainly insightful too. Perseverance, passion, volunteering experience, having like-minded and shared interest communities (perhaps through university but otherwise too) and determination were all qualities that were encouraged by the environmental officers who kindly shared their experiences of the BLU project.- -“I personally think the environmental sector has lots of potential in order to grow. As there’s always more work to be done and especially with the environment under extreme pressure. The passion and dedication is a large contributing factor for all the goals achieved within this field as resources alone does not make a difference.” - Tashreeqah Sadan- -“My advice to young aspiring environmentalists is, in order to succeed within this field, you need to have a real passion for the environment and love what you do. It is not an easy sector and the efforts often feel futile when witnessing the state of our environment. It is ultimately about persevering and knowing that changing people’s perspectives and contributing towards awareness even a little at a time makes a difference and that within itself is rewarding. Keep pushing towards your dream, it will always be worth it.” - Leigh Kelly- -Given the ongoing pandemic and the challenges that preceded it, namely unemployment and the global climate crisis, being able to celebrate beacons of positivity is essential. The BLU project and its successes, therefore, especially being able to hear from the EOs directly is truly inspiring and invigorating. UNDP is committed to continuing to support the government and other actors in this area so that many more generations of Women and Youth may share their experiences and continue to inspire their peers.- -Article written by Char Deslandes & Tove Nordberg, UNDP","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Goal 15  Life on land,South Africa,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Featured,Women's empowerment,Success Stories,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,English"

With the support of the Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, workshops were held in various countries such as Lesotho, Ghana, Malawi, Cape Verde, Rwanda and South Africa.-Following the various discussions and engagement, a need was identified both within the UN Country Team and amongst government officials to use Foresight in a very practical manner, that is to help frame the next UN Strategic Country Framework (SCF) and regional and national medium-term planning.  An important aspect would be alignment of these plans with the SDGs, National and Provincial (sub-national) Plans.-The outcome of these initiatives would ensure that plans will not only be better aligned, but also be part of a joint roadmap towards acieving developmental goals.  An added benefit would be that this will actively stimulate innovation to wards achieving empowered futures.-One of the key deliverables was a provincial level foresight exercise to ground the initiative in real developmental issues.-What follows is a short discussion of the workshop held in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. -EASTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (PDP)-The Province is in the process of reviewing its PDP due to numerous socio-economic challenges. An analysis on departmental Annual Reports and Annual Performance Plans (APP) indicate that government is unable to meet its set targets due to high service delivery demands. In some areas there is also underperformance of up to 42%.  As these areas are linked to national priorities and SDG targets, “business as usual” is not a viable option.-Foresight therefore becomes a crucial tool in stating alternative futures to unlock innovative strategic planning, policy formulation and solution-focussed design methods. Foresighting empowers decision makers and people to have a new way of thinking out of the ordinary by placing the future in the foreground.- -PUBLIC RELIANCE ON GOVERNMENT- - -Most communities and community-based organisations in the lesser-developed parts of South Africa rely on government services or on the secondary economy created by government.  Government decisions therefore have a direct impact on their lives.  Government is not always actively engaging with citizens, communities and the private sector to jointly engage on planning.  The Foresight workshops provided for the opportunity of joint engagement on what an ideal future of the province would look like and then formulating a joint plan of action.  Thus, instead of heavily relying on government, foresighting helped breaks barriers to new ways of thinking where ordinary citizens are playing their role in achieving the SDGs and co-develop solutions.- FORESIGHT AND SCENARIO PLANNING -Our traditional models and assumptions are inefficient and our planning processes do not mirror the true reflection of the realities.  As elsewhere, planning in the province assumes a slowly changing, linear future which can be predicted by relying expert knowledge.  Planners also tend to think that the future is fixed whilst future is very much in the making. Using some of the tools from the GCPSE’s Foresight Manual, the workshop, attended by government, private sector, academia and not-for-profit organisations started building a number of scenarios related to Governance and the Economy.-Guided by one of the experts in the field, Chantel Illbury, looked at areas of under-performance or pressure points (e.g. 85% of the budget spent on social services) and strategic opportunities, both current or in the future (e.g. exploring the Ocean’s Economy with 800 km of coastline and harnessing green energy).-In building the scenarios, the teams considered the:- -The teams focussed on the uncertainties with potential high impact and plotted these towards building the various scenarios.-CONCLUSION-The workshop was the start of a process to rethink local planning and make it future proof.  It centred the development cooperation between the UN and province in a very reciprocal manner.  The province gained from the UNDP expertise and knowledge and the UN CT were given insight into the developmental challenges at grass-roots level.  One of the very positive experiences for delegates was when wildcards were introduced: the solutions that came from the group to mitigate the impact of these wildcards turned out to be viable interventions that can immediately be implemented in the province to address some of the current challenges.-NEXT STEPS-The next phase of this initiative will be three-fold:",[],"Success Stories,Institutional reform"

However, it represents some unique challenges that, if not sufficiently addressed, would lead – at best – to limited impact and – at worst – to harming prospects for peace in the country.-The unprecedented damage, that has structurally undermined local economies and communities’ capacity to cope, the territorial and social fragmentation of the country after 10 years of crisis and violence, and the diminishing space for civil society and communities to participate in autonomous recovery processes, are the main challenges that Syrian people and the international organizations must consider.-To overcome these challenges and to lead the way for more effective early recovery assistance in Syria, UNDP is rolling-out a context sensitive, area-based early recovery programming initiative. The main characteristic of this approach is that it is participatory in nature by empowering diverse communities to jointly lead local recovery processes. Such an approach gives UNDP leverage to build local capacities for peace and prevent local conflict through early recovery assistance, thereby supporting the UN’s Sustaining Peace and Prevention agendas and operationalizing the Humanitarian Development Peace (HDP)  nexus in the country. It also allows UNDP Syria to have a more sustainable impact on local socio-economic recovery, by shifting from a project based to a more integrated programme approach that addresses interlinked early recovery challenges at the local level.-What is Participatory Local Recovery Planning (PLRP)-In a nutshell, the main features of this Participatory Local Recovery Planning (PLRP) process promoted by UNDP Syria are the following:-Context/Conflict Sensitive: PLRP promotes participatory, joint context sensitivity analysis in selected areas which involves communities, UN agencies, INGOs and humanitarian actors. Through this analysis, actors identify main dividers/connectors, risks and mitigation measures, as well as a stakeholder mapping to enhance social cohesion. This further encourages a collaborative approach among the UN Country Team (UNCT) and other humanitarian actors; it enables them to identify and address root causes of the crisis at the local level and contribute to the early recovery process and Leave No One Behind.-Area-based Approach: Area here does not refer only to the where but most importantly to how and by whom the process is carried out. The mobilization of local resources and identification of local solutions through dialogue and collective decision making, and the empowerment of local stakeholders, communities, and local administration are the key factors for an effective and sustainable implementation of early recovery initiatives.-Participatory: local communities, local people remain as the greatest source of the untapped peacebuilding process. The community potential can be utilized by moving from a top-down to a bottom-up approach ensuring we are leaving no one behind. To this end, the described approach ensures an inclusive analysis, raises the voice of traditionally excluded groups (women, youth, elderly, PwD, IDPs), and promotes trust building by creating a platform for dialogue between communities and local authorities/administrations, and among community members, to identify priorities, resources, and local solutions, and most importantly-PLRP Pilots:- -During 2021, UNDP Syria piloted the Participatory Local Recovery Planning approach in the district of Kadi Askar in Aleppo Governorate, and in the Old City of Hama in Hama Governorate, respectively. What has this approach shown us?-Progress in more integrated UNDP programming: We took significant steps towards more integrated UNDP projects in priority areas, in order to have more transformative and sustainable impact on recovery dynamics. We also witnessed progress in facilitating synergies with Area Humanitarian Country Team (AHCT) actors on the ground for joint impact in priority communities.-Greater and collective understanding of risks and opportunities for context sensitive programming: The joint analysis of risks and opportunities helped us to mainstream social cohesion outcomes across all programming in integrated area locations through a better understanding of dividers and connectors in the communities we serve and understand how our programming interacts with these factors.-Increased Local Ownership: Local stakeholders were no longer simply passive recipients and beneficiaries, but actively engaged in defining recovery challenges and solutions. Social responsibility has also been increased by identifying needs, but more importantly the process triggered self-organized initiatives with endogenous resources and solutions to face community challenges. Moreover, local administrations have included the communities’ priorities in their annual work plans with allocated budgets demonstrating the local administration’s buy-in and engagement to provide better service delivery changes and increase community resilience.-Promoted local dialogue: horizontal and vertical social cohesion has been increased by promoting the creation of a safe space and mechanism for exchanging views, examining assumptions, and strengthening relationships, including across social cleavages. Trust was built through local platforms/committees, among the local stakeholders involved, and between communities and local councils. Youth, women, PwDs were talking and raising their concerns to local authorities, often for the first time.-Inclusivity and empowerment of traditionally marginalized groups: inclusivity was promoted by engaging and empowering women, youth, elderly, PwDs, IDPs and other actors who are typically not at the center of policy making. Women’s leadership role was gradually enhanced during the whole processes, and this has been recognized within and by their communities.-The private sector representatives from the community (small entrepreneurs, shop owners, industrial workshops) were also engaged as a crucial asset to untap capacities to support recovery and livelihoods efforts. Not only big private sector actors (Chamber of Commerce etc.) but also small entrepreneurs, small shop owners, industrial workshops etc. from selected areas.-Promotion of community organization and implementation of local solutions mobilizing endogenous resources from the community, private sector and the municipalities without any international external aid, like the rehabilitation and beautification of public parks or rubble removal in the neighborhood. Thus, moving towards more bottom-up approach instead of a top-down.- -PLRP is not a magic potion, it comes with challenges:  -We have observed that people and communities in Syria are willing to increase their participation in local decision-making processes and be part of the solution.  In this regard, the PLRP process is providing a great opportunity not only to enhance community engagement but also to tap into the opportunities to build peace at the local level.-With this approach, the process itself is the main product, the main focus is the promotion of horizontal and vertical social cohesion through dialogue, raising the voices of the communities, and a negotiation process to identify priorities, resources and local context-relevant solutions.-This process is not without its challenges. We need to keep working on generating ownership by building capacities for dialogue and enhancing participatory planning exercises instead of importing plans drafted by external experts at their desks. Also, to achieve gender responsive planning and implementation our efforts should support the generation of disaggregated data and the inclusion of different needs and solutions for women and men in community plans.-Even if the process of local early recovery is the main product, it can’t go without delivering results with local, national, and international support. Implementation of entrenched early recovery initiatives not only will contribute to better service delivery and livelihoods but will also contribute to build trust and give hope to the communities.-Finally, a participatory area-based approach offers humanitarian actors in Syria a common framework through which they can align their interventions with both local priorities and the UN Secretary-General’s Parameters and Principles for Assistance in Syria. In the challenging and complex Syrian landscape, this can make a critical contribution to reducing the fragmentation, duplication and transaction costs of early recovery programs.-This approach might not be the “silver bullet”, but it is certainly a significant and necessary step towards empowering communities and giving them back the ownership of their own recovery process that fits their own needs, dignity and context, and which will eventually lead to enhancing social cohesion and building peace at the local level.-This blog post is the first of a blog series that will feature the work of UNDP Syria on Participatory Local Early Recovery Planning (PLERP). The goal is to share finding, insights, lesson learned, and recommendations gained from the piloting that was done during 2021, and to highlight how UNDP Syria is planning to scale-up this approach in other areas during 2022.","['Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Syrian Arab Republic,Blog post,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,UNDP,Success Stories,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Head of solutions mapping, Accelerator Lab Syria - -Accelerator lab in Syria is working with farmers on their nature-based solutions to address the complex challenge of scarcity of agricultural inputs. Our main question was how we can leverage these local solutions and make the best of what is available instead of importing exogenous solutions? the answer was found in the application of frugal entrepreneurship.- -We worked with positive deviant farmers who have found innovative and sustainable means to produce fodder and compost using locally sourced materials which gave us the opportunity to acquire hands-on experience to learn more about what frugal entrepreneurship is, its applications, and its impact on local sustainable development. We concluded our learnings in the following seven insights that were gained during our journey:- -1.       What is frugal entrepreneurship:-Just like Frugal innovations, frugal entrepreneurship is a new term that is gaining more interest among sustainable development professionals. Although there is still much to explore, but there is some sort of a consensus on what frugal entrepreneurship is which can be defined as: developing affordable products efficiently in resource-constrained environments, responding to the specific needs of underserved “customers” in developing countries and marginalized communities. It is, in our case, services and supplies provided by the same people who need them.-In the past few months, we worked with small holder famers, who have low levels of education, and are living in a resource constrained environment. However, they decided to use whatever resources available locally to produce compost and fodder. With proper mentorship from our side, these farmers became frugal entrepreneurs and started supplying the pressing needs of their communities with affordable Agri-inputs.-2.Inclusive entrepreneurship-Frugal entrepreneurship approach is bringing us closer to achieving the 8th sustainable development goal: Promote decent work and sustainable inclusive economic growth” and the 10th goal: reduce inequalities. Frugal entrepreneurship offers the opportunity to all people regardless of their background to start their own frugal businesses. Moreover, it   can be utilized to reduce inequality and poverty by opining the door to equal opportunities in creating inclusive and well-functioning markets that low-income customers can be part of; such customers who are usually placed at the bottom of the pyramid neglected, forgotten, and underserved in mainstream markets.-Small holder farmers are the most affected by the scarcity of Agri-inputs; however, they are excluded from big markets that mostly target large scale farmers. By making the materials affordable and available on community level, these frugal entrepreneurs are contributing to creating a more inclusive market.- -3.       Is it the same as social enterprises?-Frugal entrepreneurship shares many characteristics with social enterprises; they both generate positive societal and environmental returns e.g., reducing costs, addressing unmet needs, and creating benefits to their underserved community.-The difference between frugal entrepreneurship and social enterprise lays in their triggers. A social enterprise is triggered by social responsibility, a mission that aims to achieve social, economic   goals and to earn revenue at the same time. Frugal entrepreneurship on the other hand, are triggered mostly by unmet needs that entrepreneurs themselves suffer from.- -4.Environmentally friendly entrepreneurship:-Frugal entrepreneurship represents many opportunities for new forms of frugal supply chains in a context of resource-constrained environments. Doing more with less, closed-loop supply chain, preserving the already scarce resources, and contributing to a circular economy are now achievable goals with the application of a frugal supply chain.-Frugal supply chain means that there are less raw materials used in sourcing phase, reincorporation of waste and recycled materials into production cycle, reduced usage of packaging’s clutter, and shorter to no distances traveled for distribution.-When producing the compost and fodder, the farmers who we are working with depend on locally available resources including waste. For instance, one farmer is repurposing old kitchen utensils to sprout barley, that is used as animal feed alternative. Another farmer is feeding organic waste to red worms to make vermicompost. Moreover, these innovative farmers are using minimal packaging materials thus reducing waste generation.-Another proof that frugal entrepreneurship is environmentally friendly can be seen in the way it is helping Syrian farmers to transition to a more regenerative and sustainable farming by making regenerative farming supplies locally available and affordable.- -5.       Empowering local communities:-One important lesson we learned during our work is that working with women and men to expand their frugal businesses that serve their communities is an act of empowerment. By trusting in their expertise and abilities, we are showing these communities that the solutions to the challenges they are facing is sometimes in their own hands. Moreover, supporting frugal entrepreneurs contributes to building a resilient community that is confidant in its indigenous knowledge and local capabilities to achieve sustainably.-6.       Creating networks: Social cohesion-An eco-system for frugal entrepreneurs can be made by connecting and directing entrepreneurs to available resources, potential customers, and to other frugal entrepreneurs with complementary competences.-The network that was created among our targeted farmers helped them in expanding their work and identifying potential interested customers. Furthermore, they recognized the opportunity to learn from each other, so they started to exchange knowledge and expertise.-Such interactions among farmers are bringing the community members closer to each other and strengthening social cohesion.-7.       A Positive contagious behavior:-The frugal entrepreneurs we met are positive deviant farmers; despite being exposed to the same challenges and limitation as other farmers in their communities, they distinguished themselves in a positive way and decided to create solutions from whatever available resources around them. It was great for us to witness how these positive deviant farmers inspired other farmers to start acting instead of just waiting for outside solutions. Many farmers started imitating the frugal entrepreneurs by following their steps in making compost and fodder from organic waste. Moreover, some of them identified potential customers in nearby villages thus scaling up the solutions and contributing to solving part of the scarcity of Agri-input challenge.-These insights were generated by working and engaging directly with farmers. There is still much more to be done and learned about how to support frugal entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, we hope that this blogpost brings us one step closer to understanding the importance of this emerging entrepreneurial approach which is contributing to leaving no one behind.- ","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Syrian Arab Republic,Innovation,Chemicals and waste management,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Food security,Success Stories,Entrepreneurship,Solutions Mapping,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,UNDP,Accelerator Labs,English"

Organisms don’t think of CO2 as a poison. Plants and organisms that make shells, coral, think of it as a building block” - Janine Benyus- -When we set out on our household waste recycling challenge, we had no idea that it would lead us to the development of a new type of entity. Something more than a modified version of countless recycling initiatives around the globe. Yet, the unique circumstances in Syria combined with the determination and willpower of the Accelerator Lab, UNDP Syria country office and UNDP Aleppo area office to provide a fresh perspective on waste resulted in so much more than a 300-day challenge (3 x 100-day cycles). The result was a fundamentally different way to engage economic resources in a post conflict social setting to resolve environmental catastrophes: To look at waste in all its forms as building blocks. Before we continue, however, Let’s start by answering the curious questions building up in your mind as you read the blog:- -What? The Syria Accelerator Lab alongside local partners designed what has become known as the Reverse Shop; a nature inspired outdoor booth focused on the exchange of household waste for physical and virtual incentives. The Reverse Shop is fully solar powered, connects to existing diverse reverse supply chains that were previously inaccessible to households due a problem with the economics of waste collection. Moreover, it adds a layer of sub-segregation that reduces social stigma & health hazards towards vulnerable informal waste pickers. Lastly, it highlights both the negative and positive impacts of individual actions on entire ecosystems.- -Why? Simply put “The major problem in the world is the result of the difference between how nature works, and the way people think” – Gregory Bateson. “Nature runs on sunlight... uses only the energy it needs... fits form to function... recycles everything... rewards cooperation... banks on diversity... demands local expertise... curbs excesses from within... taps the power of limits” - Janine Benyus. “In nature there is no such thing as waste. In nature nothing is wasted; everything is recycled” – David Suzuki. “Waste isn’t waste until we waste it.” - William Adams Jr.- -Where? The Reverse Shop is located at the heart of Aleppo city in one of the main parks surrounded by neighbourhoods of different economic segments. Its proximity to shopping areas and schools means we can track the behavioural insights stemming from a diverse target population.- -When? Our challenge was conducted in 3 phases from April – December 2021. Our behavioural insights testing period will take place from January to March 2022.- -How? It exchanges these products for physical and virtual incentives. This is done through specialized waste collection stations that are gamified in order to engage families with a specific focus on rewarding children for positive sustainable behaviour.
- -“One must do what one can do. No matter how little it is, it is nonetheless a human testimony and human testimonies, as long as they are not based on greed or personal ambition for power, can have unexpected positive effects” – Manfred Max Neef- -Commencing our challenge by shaping a collective understanding of the problem at hand was perhaps our wisest move. Going into a challenge with preconceptions about why previous initiatives did not work can be extremely misleading. After all we did not know whether it was the rollout? The community engagement? The recycling colour scheme being unclear? Or did society simply not want to participate? Read more about these in our previous blogpost.- -From our investigation it turns out there were 2 overarching problems: [1] Even when society participated in coloured bin waste segregation, the waste was dumped into the same collection vehicles leading to a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration amongst the community for disregarding their efforts [2] Given that segregation activities require knowledge and energy, most adults are unable to prioritize the issue over existing post conflict struggles they are faced with.- -That is why our 1st 100 days were spent with waste pickers, waste bin designers, owners of previous recycling initiatives, workers in the reverse supply chain, local non-profits, and UNDP staff to form a comprehensive picture. Our finding: The biggest problem with the waste collection system is the collection point itself (waste bin) which had unfortunately been degraded to an unsegregated biohazard to both the community and to waste collectors.- -Our approaches were also diverse. We visited informal waste disposal sites, waste sorting sites, collection bins, previous UN and UNDP initiatives and even waste upcycling factories. We conducted focus groups with waste collectors, women led households, local NGO’s and previous UNDP staff. Lastly, we concluded our investigation with an interactive workshop around waste that simulated the household trash dumping process to help contextualize the problem. At root, all our insights pointed towards a lack of incentive to sort. Our solution? Gamification & Economification*- -*Gamification: Addition of game-like elements including physical and virtual incentives to the design of initiatives in order to encourage children to participate in recycling and upcycling.- -Economification: Giving economic, social, and environmental market value to a behavioural output that can be used to root out worst behaviours (in this case the biggest polluting ones).- -Yet, without a champion who stands to gain something from their positive behaviour, any initiative is bound to fail or be unsustainable. From our citywide and countrywide survey one thing was clear; mothers currently are the owners of recycling and upcycling in the household. Yet, children were the ideal champion that mothers could positively influence in the household as they learn easily, interact with one another more often and have the spare time.
- -“Keep your thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your words positive because your words become your behaviour. Keep your behaviour positive because your behaviour becomes your habits” – Mahatma Gandhi- -Before rushing to solutions, the 2nd 100 days of our journey led us down an interesting road that focused on indigenous recycling knowledge that has been overshadowed. Ignoring that would have left the community with a sense that their existing positive behaviours are not appreciated. Interestingly, what we found was actually part of a broader cultural mechanism used to deal with useful waste. Read more about these in our previous blogpost.- -Over the course of July, in collaboration with a local youth platform named Syrian Window (Shebak Souri), interactive posts and videos regarding sustainable practices were posted on social media to create awareness and gauge knowledge about these practices. This led to discoveries that added to our collection of insights.- -The amazing world we uncovered was the result of traditional activities as well as some which came to being during economic hardship. For example, households have existing mechanisms in place to deal with certain types of food waste (old bread & eggshells) which can be used in chicken feed. Households keeping old cooking oil aside after using it to avoid polluting drain water. Children making all types of useful products from CD’s. Fathers performing plastic surgery on old chairs to extend their life (Ask us about this!) and so much more!- -What was needed was a way to extend this to virtually any waste and to involve the middle to higher income families in these mechanisms (given our analysis showed that they are the biggest waste producers). The key to this was in viewing it through an opportunity lens. After all, this waste is ending up somewhere. Might as well direct it to the right place in exchange for something rewarding.- -This, arguably, was one of the most important findings that would eventually lead to the selection of the appropriate testing area. In a post crisis context, people were simply unresponsive or potentially even harsh in their criticism against recycling and upcycling initiatives that they sometimes viewed as unnecessary or wasteful. If we were to transform the positive behavioural underpinnings into positive behavioural habits, we had to find a place where the community could simultaneously see the destructive impact of waste on the environment whilst being in the right mental state to engage with our proposed solutions.- - - -“If you're going to perform inception, you need imagination. You need the simplest version of the idea-the one that will grow naturally” - Inception- -Ever take part in a collective design activity and think to yourself... How will we know what to try? Whose idea is right? Which idea will have scaling problems? Should I contribute my crazy idea or is there enough craziness floating around?- -Well... this is just a taste of the problems we faced when trying to gather ideas for solutions to the challenge in the 3rd 100 days. What was noteworthy, however, was the way we resolved this problem: Experimentception.... Yes... Experimentation mixed with the movie Inception. You see in our context there was no way to know for sure which ideas were the right ones. Moreover, the evolution of these ideas into initiatives might bring about unforeseen side effects. The solution? Try everything... the simplest version of everything... multiple times.- -After all, why not solve the waste cooking oil problem by making a vending machine that disposes soap (one of the upcycled products of used cooking oil) and alerts an existing reverse supply chain business to collect the oil once it is economically feasible to do so. Also, why not make the side wall an area for people who want to positively vandalize our machine (which we treasure as art since it adds uniqueness) and build trust by making the internal mechanisms visible to get kids excited about recycling and cleanliness whilst comforting adults with transparency.- -The point of the above? They are very different ideas... They came from tens of people...  They promote different behaviours... Some might even be unnecessary to the success of the overall concept. Yet, by allowing a space for all ideas to be tested, we included as many opinions and perspectives as possible. Moreover, by replicating the same design decision across various experiments one can quickly identify whether it was the experiment or design decision that was problematic. In a sense, it mimicked implementing a genetic algorithm approach to testing design decisions into experimentation. At the end of our collective design, we ended up with 7 coherent concepts which synergized from over 50 ideas [Ask us for more details]:- -Waste Material-Sub-Segregation-Format-Reward Type-Plastic-Bottles - Cap-Vending Machine-Plastic Lego Brick-Plastic-6 Categories-Stationary Bin-Peer Reward-Plastic, Garden, Hazard-Each Bin into 4-Movable Bin-No Reward-Cooking Oil-None-Vending Machine-100g Soap Bar-Paper-Books - Shredded-Vending Machine-Motivational Quote-Chips Bags-None-Vending Machine-1 Minute Cartoon-All Waste-10 Categories-Posters-Knowledge of Impact- - -“No one has ever done anything like this. I know, that's why it's going to work” – The Matrix- -On the 31st of November 2021 we conducted a virtual call to share our journey with the UNDP Accelerator Lab network, UNDP Syria office and our local partners. The call had a hidden surprise in store for the attendees; it included a virtual live walkthrough of the Reverse Shop that online participants could get try out physically.- -Two mentimeter diagrams came out of the session. One was for a vote on which experiment had the biggest chance for success. The plastic bottle and oil recycling machines received the highest vote. Moreover, our design decisions were also put to the test and product incentives as well as giving a space for artistic vandalism received special attention.- -So now for the big question: Will our initiative solve the waste problem once and for all?.. No. What it did do is bring together a team of over 50 people from diverse backgrounds to contribute their insights into the design of a comprehensive initiative that could be the seed for a full-scale solution. More importantly it presents the community with a clear economic, social, and environmental choice: Vicious Cycle or Upcycle?","['Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Syrian Arab Republic,Blog post,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs,English"

We did two challenges on home recycling and Compost practices; data was collected in the process and our story here is about the insights we gained from that data and the journey that led us from one challenge to another.-Phase I: First Challenge-Discussions were happening between the lab members when I joined on what could be our first challenge? In the Syrian context we had many hot topics and picking one topic wasn’t an easy task.-This was our first encounter with data as a guiding tool. Signals were around us and we decided to choose our challenge based on the most prominent one.-several visits were carried by the lab members at that time and the most visible signal to us was waste and how it’s being handled in general and recycled. Data was captured about waste management and practices across different domains and functions in Syria. The overall picture showed that it’s mostly for manufacturing and big scale waste. Household waste wasn’t handled directly and efforts in that domain were limited. Household waste management was going to be our first challenge and more data was yet to be explored in that domain. -Phase II: Household Waste-For our first challenge we started exploring the issue of Home (Household) Waste. 500 people participated in a survey about household waste, people with diverse backgrounds and cultures representing the Syrian mosaic. Now the issue of household recycling is a very wide topic and might seem vague to a lot of people. When asked about recycling in general people seemed to misunderstand the concept and picture it as a practice made by rich people till now it seems that recycling isn’t present at the household level in Syria and the community has no idea about the process, but this might not be an accurate picture. To get a better understanding we decided to break things down.-The recycling process involves different stages (reduce - reuse – dispose – fully Recycle) and we decided to ask about each stage separately. Responses were diversified at this level and a new picture was forming.   -Now it’s obvious that reuse is the most used practice while fully recycling is practiced in 5% only of the surveyed households. Reduce and dispose are also a two common practices.-Families prefer the reuse practice because it’s an easy and straightforward to them old plastic bags are reused plastic containers are reused as a food container.... etc. A lot of these practices are already considered a wide traditional practice in the community, on the other hand the fully recycled concept was vague to families, and a practice made by rich people. - -We asked the families why they would recycle after explaining the whole concept to them. A significant amount showed interest in recycling if it had a financial value in return, a very natural response if we look at the current economic situation of the country. Caring about environment and hating pollution were very unpopular choices to the families and wouldn’t constitute a priority.-So, the next question was about motives: what would encourage a family to recycle their waste?- -It was said honestly that the only motivation for recycling is to have something in return. An eye opener on what type of experiment we should try!-Inside the household who would oversee different activities. Which activity involves certain family members and do members change when the activity changes? - -We found that no matter what activity we are talking about mothers are always in charge. Mothers are involved in all activities, and they manage the whole process if implemented by a household. This could mean that targeting mothers in future campaigns would lead to a better impact but what if we involve other family members wouldn’t this enhance the whole practice across the whole community?-So far, the data journey led us into two experiments a first experiment on incentives and how we could motivate people to recycle through a motivation. The second experiment is on children and what would motivate them to participate in recycling and what impact that could create? A blog post by the lab will have more details about those experiments.-While writing this post our first challenge on recycling is still ongoing and we are trying two different experiments one that is built to test if we can motivate mothers to participate more in recycling and a second experiment that revolves around giving gifts to kids and test if that encourages them to participate in recycling activities. Once started we will keep looking at data trends and inputs to check if those tests succeeded in changing behaviors of our targeted community and will check for any possible lead from the generated data. An upcoming blog post by the lab will have more details about those experiments.-We didn’t stop here, and we continued to seek more insight from our data, recycling value chain vary depending on the product. Mapping those value chains gave us a very rich data on the current practices,-Metal, cardboard, paper, glass are waste products that have a fully integrated value chain in the Syrian market and nothing much could be done about that, but one product was interesting because it seemed to be left all the time since it had no clear value. Organic waste was produced by all households but seemed to stay in the trash landfills. No value in the current value chains was present for organic waste and this kept us wondering if we can do anything about that!-Phase III: Compost / fodder practices-Organic waste is available, and we need to use it what can we do?-A quick search led us to the most obvious answer: organic waste can be turned into compost to be used by farmers or fodder fed to livestock. Is there a need for compost or fodder? An answer to that question could help us in defining our next challenge!-Due to the current situation in Syria a huge decline in fertilizers import and production happened in the last years leading to an obvious shortage of fertilizers in the agricultural sector. Importing fertilizers declined due to different reasons and local production reached 0% in the past years! A huge gap that could lead to disastrous impact on agriculture.    - -Same patterns are also seen for fodder production and import leading into a big shortage of fodder for livestock. Fodder import declined and production almost reached 0% another huge gap that could lead to huge impact on the livestock and farmers raising livestock.- - -The facts were so clear, and our next challenge was data driven toward utilizing organic compost in creating compost (organic fertilizer) and fodder and this is how our second challenge was born!-Currently we are testing the impact of compost / fodder creation from organic waste on the agricultural sector the test will be monitored, data collection is planned to check impact and any possible future leads.-Phase IV: next steps-The story didn’t end here as you can see it’s an ongoing journey led by data insights, some turns we unpredicted yet justified and that’s what makes the journey interesting.-One last note while trying to survey families and households a lot of the time it was really hard to reach them or get in contact with them specially households in remote areas and that made us wonder: is there a digital gap in Syria? are people disconnected from the internet? how are they managing the digital exclusion if any?-Those questions might lead us to an important search on the map of digital inclusion in Syria and who knows if the data journey could lead us to a new challenge!","['Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Syrian Arab Republic,Chemicals and waste management,Goal 15  Life on land,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Success Stories,English,Accelerator Labs"

Head of solutions mapping, Accelerator Lab Syria 

-It is one of those times when you search for something and end up discovering something else. It all started during our previous learning cycle, in which we were trying to understand the recycling scene in Syria with a focus on household recycling behaviors. Our main finding was that most of the recyclable materials in Syria are being recycled, whether through formal or informal channels. However, organic waste and some other cheap recyclables are being wasted. Whilst working on finding ways to change behavior and encourage households to recycle their solid waste, we knew that something needed to be done to address organic waste issue. Discarded organic waste is considered to be a major issue in Syria; In addition to the unpleasant odor generated, organic waste creates a perfect environment for pests and insects to reproduce. Moreover, it generates methane gas that is a significant contributor to global warming. Therefore, we decided to explore in more depth what people in Syria are doing with their organic waste, and what grassroot solutions might be out there that we, Accelerator lab, can work with to benefit from organic waste.-We began our quest by conducting a solutions hunt in the coastal rural area. Interestingly, we met with many small-holder farmers who are using organic waste either as a compost to fertilize soil or as a feed for their farm animals. In fact, feeding poultry and livestock from household leftovers was a common practice by our older generation. However, once commercial fodder became available, people preferred to use it simply because it was more convenient. The same thing applies to fertilizers, because of easy access farmers grew dependent on chemical fertilizers more than they did on organic compost. Farmers were drawn to the quick wins of using these commercial inputs without any consideration to the harmful long-term effect they might have on the health of their soil and environment. First, because it used to be cheaper and subsidized by the government. Second because it was easily accessible.-When we approached the farmers who were using organic waste for compost and fodder to know more about their motives, they told us it is because they did not have other options. “Nowadays fodder and chemical fertilizers are scarce and so expensive, small-scale farmers like us can’t afford it anymore, so we had to look for locally available and cheaper alternatives that meet our needs” one of the farmers informed us.-This statement drove us to look up grassroot solutions we mapped earlier this year that also addressed limited access to fodder and fertilizers. Some of these solutions depended on organic waste, while others depended on other nature-based resources.  For example, many farmers from different parts of Syria are growing Azolla, a type of water fern, to feed their poultry. Azolla is not a native fern to Syria and most of these farmers learned how to grow it through YouTube videos. Although Azolla cultivation proved to be a good alternative to animal feed, it is still considered to be invasive and damaging to local water resources in Syria. Another example of animal feed alternatives is sprouted barley. Apparently, sprouted barely is more sustainable and nature-friendly than azolla because it has no negative effect on the local environment.   As for compost, we came across many farmers who are producing vermicompost and who started a small composting business by selling portion of their compost production to other farmers.  Noticeably, those solutions, although not all of them can be considered sustainable, are all nature-based solutions and they depend on natural and locally available resources. If one thing these solutions indicates, it is the importance and urgency of the issue of scarcity and high prices of those agriculture inputs (Fodder and fertilizers).-This conclusion was confirmed by the data published on UN food and agricultural organization (FAO) website. As Data below shows, since 2011, Syria witnesses a drastic drop in the production and importation of both fertilizers and fodder. Moreover, transportation costs hit its highest records during past years, which amplified the already bad situation and contributed to the increase of food production prices. Clearly, high prices of food production meant high prices of food to consumers thus less food for the poor and the marginalized.  It is like a chain of misfortunate events that had a ripple effect across the agricultural supply chain, especially of small-holder farmers, and eventually worsened food security situation.- -From organic waste to food security:-It became clear for us, the Accelerator Lab, that we need to work with small-holder farmers on addressing the challenge of inaccessibility to fodder and fertilizers. However, at this point, we needed to organize our findings in a way that allows us to understand the whole picture. To do so we did a simple visualization session where we were able to connect the dots between the different elements of the issue. Moreover, this session enabled us to visualize the connection between where we started, organic waste, and where we ended, food security. - -At the end of the exercise, we pinpointed where and how the accelerator lab is going to intervene. We identified three ways to address the inaccessibility to fodder and fertilizers that builds on existing grassroot nature-based solutions:-On an individual farmer’s level, we are testing how to create additional revenue streams to farmers, who are already producing compost and/or fodder, using frugal entrepreneurship as a basis. With a network of trained volunteers on frugal entrepreneurship, we will try to encourage farmers to sell their extra production of fodder and compost by linking them to local market.-On a local level, Accelerator lab will build on, test, and develop local solutions. we will assist in testing the possibility of overcoming the sustainability gap by sourcing local materials to decrease transportation costs, and by cultivating solar energy to power the locally constructed Agri-machines, which help increasing the production of fodder and compost.-On the community level, we will test a community composting model that focuses on using food waste coming from restaurants and hotels. For this initiative we intend to identify 6 to 8 female farmers, who will be trained on how to make compost from food waste and guide them on how to sell their product to other farmers. We are going to test the impact of the community composting initiative on enhancing local soils, supporting local food production, cutting amount of wasted food, and creating community development opportunities.-To know more about the results of these initiatives, stay tuned for our next blog! - ","['Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Syrian Arab Republic,Blog post,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Food security,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs,English"

There is no water pump in her village, she has to fetch water from a ditch which is dug beside the almost dried up river bank. Rebecca’s biggest wish is to have water access near her home. “The day that I can fetch water near our home, I will dance with joy!” Watch video -Rebecca’s wish will soon be granted UNDP is supporting a project to install OffGridBox technology not only in her district, but nine other districts in Tanzania. The multipurpose OffGridBoxes will provide safe water and clean energy as well    
-Magnitude of the problem-Tanzania’s vast potential renewable energy is largely untapped. Sun hours per year ranges between 2080 to 3500, with global horizontal radiation of 4-7kwh per square per day. But still a majority of rural population rely on firewood as the main source of energy. The same applies to safe and clean water, despite being surrounded by five major Lakes and other water bodies on land mass i.e. small lakes, dams, rivers etc only a fraction of the rural population have access to clean and safe water. If only these sources are tapped it will improve the lives of the rural population tremendously.-With a population projection of 54.2 million people (2018 NBS projections) out of which 70.4% of the population live in the rural areas; yet only 16% have access to electricity and more than 70% have no access to clean and safe water. -Providing people with clean source of energy and safe water will remarkably improve their living standards and health. The burden of waterborne diseases especially in rural areas is appauling. Diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery and cholera from drinking unsafe water is one of the major causes of death for the under-fives. 
-Trekking for water is also another cause of truancy and school drop out for many adolescent girls like Rebecca in rural area. A lot of their time is spent trekking long hours in search of water, especially during the dry season. -A solution in place-UNDP is working with the Local Government Authorities in three districts of Bunda, Ikungi and Busega to pilot OffGridBox technology, which will spill over to eight  villages of Mtavira, Makotea, Mungaa, Mwamigongwa, Mkula & Busami and Three Islands of Sozia, Buyanza, Namuguma. The villages and Islands have different topographical dynamics in terms of environment, culture, energy and water sources.-In all of these villages and Islands they either have to buy water, which does not come cheap or walk more than 4kms back and forth to fetch water themselves.-Three out of the eight  sites  are islands situated in Lake Victoria, the other three are close to Lake Victoria and the remaining three are situated in a very dry area and are highly populated by both humans and cattle.-The project is unique in its entirety, taking an example of the three islands of Sozia, Buyanza and Namuguma. These islands have never had running tap water since independence, they have always largely depended on water from the Lake and of late bottled water, which pose a risk of polluting the Lake with the plastic bottles. Even though they draw water directly from Lake Victoria, it is still not safe and clean for human consumption. Increased usage of motorboats, which dock at the shores often spilling oil in the Lake poses danger to anyone drinking that water. A majority of the islanders use the Lake to relieve themselves, again this one of the major causes of cholera and other waterborne diseases in the island. -The OffGridBox technology project aims to improve access to clean, safe and affordable water and energy services to these marginalized communities. It is envisaged that this project will impact close to 4,000 households with an estimated population of 28,000. The box brings more potential to improve horticultural productivity, education, health and livelihood in general. - - Benefits that come along the OffGridBox technology include; clean and safe water, solar power which will simplify their daily activities and improve their earnings. For example, barber shops, hair salons, ice making business especially in the three islands, milling machine, powering hospital equipment, computers for schools, fishing lights, irrigation among other things. The social impact of this project is even better – reduced waterborne diseases, improved literacy and school completion by lighting, wifi connectivity for villages with smart phones, reduce CO2 emissions.-“Before the OffGridBox project, we used to get cholera and bilharzia outbreaks in our island,” confesses the Sozia Island Chairman, Yusuf Masolwa. He further said, “the water we used to drinking was not clean and safe at all. As you can see, we are surrounded by water, we dock our boats everywhere, so the water is always polluted by the spill over of oils from the boats. Some of the island dwellers are not hygienic they do their business in the Lake; this is also a major cause of polluted water in the Island.”  Chairman Masolwa and Islanders are happy with the project, because now they have access to clean and safe water. Watch video-In December 2019, two OffGridBoxes installed at Mtavira district, Singida region were inaugurated by Dr. Kitila Mkumbo, Permanent Secretary Ministry of Water and Irrigation. Access to clean and safe water in Mtavira was in dire situation. The villagers used to fetch water from ditches and shallow dug wells, the water was cloudy and, on many occasions, very dirty mixed with soil and sometimes human and cattle used the same well to get water. In Mtavira alone two OffGridBoxes have been installed, six water distribution points and one well built. -In his opening remarks, Dr. Mkumbo applauded UNDP’s efforts and valuable partnership with the Government in ensuring Tanzanians residing even in the furthest corner of the country get basic services like clean energy and safe water.-“UNDP is our valuable partner and we appreciate their continued support. UNDP has been at the forefront in supporting the Government and they often reach the remote places first even before the Government. We thank them for supporting this highly needed project for bringing clean energy and safe water to the people of Mtavira.” Commented Dr. Mkumbo. Watch video-“We have been facing water problems for a long time, I have never seen clear water here since I was born. The water that we used before we shared with our cattle. Commented Yona Rogers Malugu, Mtavira resident. He further adds, “The water that we were using is cloudy and brown, not safe and clean at all. We just drunk it since we had no alternative, and sometimes by God’s Grace we don’t get sick. We asre very grateful to UNDP for its support in the OffGridBox project, we now enjoy clean and safe water. Watch video- -What is OffGridBox technology and how it is operated -The OffGridBox system is a compact, all in-one solution that fits entirely inside a 6x6x6 ft shipping container and is equipped with all the hardware needed to produce electricity and water. The box can charge up to 130 power banks per day, provide up to 1,000 litres of drinking water and can connect to TVs, Fans, refrigerators etc. The box also contributes to reduction of carbon emission into the atmosphere thus reducing the cost of using fuel as a source of energy.-The box is operated by trained village members who are identified by the village authority. They might be two or three members per box. Their responsibilities range from box management, sales, customer care and daily reporting.-Ali Rajabu, one of the OffGridBox keepers is delighted to assume the responsibility as the box keeper. ""I am very delighted for being selected as one of the box keepers. This box has really transformed our lives in many ways. We used to buy a litre of water for 1,000Tshs, now with this offgridbox technology we pay 200Tshs per litre, and the water is clean and safe this is indeed amazing!"" Comments Rajab happily. Watch video -Hamida Rajab, Mtavira boxkeeper is happy with the technology because they are now profiting a lot with the OffGridBox in operation. “We provide phone charging services, we sale family kit powerbanks, we sale clean and safe water for drinking and general household consumption. On a normal day we charge 20-30 phones and during market days we charge up to 300 phones for only 200 TShs. Honestly the villagers and I are really happy with all the services that this box can provide,” explains Hamida. Watch Video

The groups are in Kasulu Distirct Council, Kasulu Town Council, Kibondo and Kakonko districts  
-In April 2019, the 12 groups went through a two days in-store coaching session to capacitate them to gain more knowledge and experience of doing business better and smartly. Thesession touched on three specific areas; 
-1. Business model development -2. Governance  -3. Financial management. -The approach used was hands on to ensure the participants understand better through live examples. The sessions were held inside the premises of the group enterprise in order to learn the achievements and challenges faced on the ground. Where possible the coach discussed with the suppliers who were on site to advice on different angles derived from the shared challenges. -Challenges were noted and solutions proposed to ensure smooth running of their enterprises. This activity is under Kigoma Joint Programme (KJP) on Youth and Women’s Economic Empowerment (YWEE) theme that cuts across multiple sectors to improve development and human security in Kigoma region.  -Groups Testimonies
-The beneficiaries testified that the knowledge gained has helped them improve their group and individual businesses, including winning more trust and approval from male counterparts to engage in the group affairs than was before the support.   
-“I share the advice I get here with my husband back home; it helps me get permission to attend sessions and sometimes implement the advice I get from my group and sessions to my family” 
-The groups expressed sincere appreciation for the support and promised to demonstrate good discipline and transparency in using the grant received to achieve the goals, especially after the coaching sessions. Through the support, the groups have become more known in their communities and many more women and youth are attracted to join.  The Youth Groups have a lot of work to do and expressed their gratitude to UNDP and ILO for providing them the grant that will fuel them to eradicate poverty, hunger and improve their lives.  -Based on its focus and impacts, this intervention is in line with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1), which focuses on Poverty eradication and Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) focusing on Zero Hunger. 
-About the Kigoma Joint Programme 
-The programme involves 16 UN Agencies and was developed in cooperation with the regional and district authorities based on developments needs of the region and the capacities of the UN in Tanzania.-It consists of six converging and cross-sectoral themes, namely: Sustainable Energy and Environment; Youth and Women’s Economic Empowerment; Violence Against Women and Children, Agriculture with a Focus on Developing Local Markets; Education with a Focus on Girls and Adolescent Girls; and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in Kigoma.

This article is the result of a week-long visit to 3 of the 12 Nature Forest Reserves which UNDP supports along with GEF, working hand in hand with the Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) and with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. The purpose of the visit was to gain deeper insight into the impact and challenges of UNDPs projects, through meetings with the local authorities, beneficiaries and communities.-The visit took the team into the woods, more specifically to Chome, Magamba and Amani nature forest reserves, all supported by UNDP through the Enhancing Nature Forest Reserves project (2014-2020). The purpose of the project is to enhance the protection of natural forests in Tanzania through establishing a network of Nature Forest Reserves, the category of protected areas that offers the highest level of protection under the National Forest Act of Tanzania. So far, 12 Nature Forest Reserves have been gazetted, many with support from the project. -An important contribution of the project is the construction of well-equipped ranger posts on the borders of the forests. A ranger post just outside Chome Nature Forest Reserve, which is located in a remote and mountainous area in Same District was recently constructed, greatly improving the rangers’ access to the forests. The proximity to the forest is a crucial factor in the rangers’ work including patrolling to prevent illegal logging and mining as well as the spread of wildfires. -Another significant contribution of the project is the construction and maintenance of walking trails and forest roads. These networks serve a dual purpose of servicing the forest officers on their daily patrols, while also making the forests more accessible to tourists, whether they prefer to discover the forest by foot, on a mountain bike or by car. -The communities living in and around the Nature Forest Reserves traditionally depend on the forest for fuelwood and other resources. To ensure sustainability, an important part of UNDPs work is to promote development opportunities for the communities, whilst reducing the pressures on the forest. Around Amani Nature Forest Reserve, the team visited two villages where such initiatives are supported.  In Chemka village local artisans have been trained in building more fuel-efficient stoves. For Amina this means she now only collects fuelwood every other week, compared to twice a week before.-Another example is from Shebomeza Village, a village enclosed by the nature reserve, where UNDP has supported the construction of micro biogas plants. For Stella (below right), a widow who has been living all her life without electricity, manure from her cows provide enough gas for a stove and lamps for the household of 10 which she heads. Both these initiatives simultaneously reduce the need for fuel wood (and hence the pressure on the forests) and save both time and labour for the women using them. 
-In addition to more efficient cooking technology, UNDP is committed to the creation of alternative, sustainable income generating activities for communities in and around the forests. In Fanusi village, outside Amani Nature Forest Reserve, one can visit a butterfly farm which was constructed with funds from the UNDP/GEF Small Grants Programme. The farmers collect a few pupae from the forest, which are bred inside a netted tent. The survival rate of the butterflies is much higher than in the wild, so they reproduce quickly. The pupae can be exported to fairs and exhibitions abroad, thus providing an alternative source of income for the communities. Furthermore, the butterflies attract tourists, which for a small entrance fee can admire the multitude of specimens up close. The Visitors Book, which the community proudly displayed, shows that not only tourists, but also the Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism along with many other dignitaries and Government officials recently visited the butterfly farm.
-In Hekapombe village, on the outskirts of Chome Forest Nature Reserve, the steepness of the surrounding terrain makes farming challenging due to loss of moisture and nutrients from the soil and the threat of erosion. Through the Small Grants Programme ̧ this is a challenge that has been overcome: the village has constructed irrigation furrows from a nearby stream originating in the forest, and the water is channelled to farming terraces. The terraces retain the moisture and nutrients, while trees planted along the ridges and edges of the terraces provide shade and prevent erosion.   -In addition to being the home of unique biodiversity in terms of plants, animals and insects, Tanzania’s forests also play an important role as water catchment areas. The rain that falls in the country’s forest flows into streams and rivers that eventually provide millions of people with water. That is also the case for the Zigi River, which rises from the Usambara Mountains, where Amani Nature Forest Reserve is located. -To enhance the sustainability of the river catchments, UNDP is not only supporting the protection of the upstream forest, but also downstream communities that rely on the river for irrigation and household needs. Through the Securing Watershed Services Project (2015-2020), UNDP, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation and Tanga Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority have supported the construction of permanent water supply to Mashewa village in Muheza District.-The project has improved both the daily life of the community and protects the environment. Before the water supply was in place, the community went to the river to gather water, wash clothes and water their cattle. This practice was risking contamination of the water source for hundreds of thousands of people downstream as well as erosion of the riverbank. Now, the community spends less time collecting water for their daily needs, whilst the riverbanks are used for growing crops such as black pepper, which in addition to hindering erosion provides an additional source of income for the community. -The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reaffirms what we already know: there is no Planet B. The UN Secretary General stated it clearly: “climate change is running faster than we are.”. The global changes will have local impacts, including on the forests and rivers of Tanzania, and the communities depending on them. The contributions described above may be small in a global perspective, but they are nonetheless critical to safeguard the environment and combat deforestation, whilst preserving the livelihoods of communities.-The week-long field trip provided plenty of first-hand impressions of how UNDPs support is making a real difference to the environment and to the local communities. The impacts of the initiatives are tangible and significant, and serve as good examples of activities that can be scaled up and implemented in other places as well. UNDP is committed to continue these efforts, in partnership with the Government of Tanzania and the international donor community. -Only by working together will we achieve our goal of sustainable development, for people and for the planet.

Through community-based adaptation approaches, communities are empowered adequately use their own knowledge and decision-making processes to act on climate change.-From 2012, UNDP Tanzania has been supporting people in rural communities to increase their awareness and knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation through several projects at policy level as piloting at local community levels. One such project is the Climate Change Adaptation through Small Grants Programme, which has been implemented in collaboration with the Vice President’s Office, Division of Environment. Due to the success of the project through the provision of water to remote rural areas during the initial implementation period from 2013-2015, it was decided by the steering committee that the initiative should be scaled up leading to project extension to 2018.-In June 2018, UNDP fielded a mission to three villages where upscaling efforts are currently taking place – Kurio and Chinangali in Dodoma Region, and Ulyampiti in Singida Region – to see what progress has been made so far and challenges the people in the villages are facing.-The biggest challenge facing these villages has been the lack of water for domestic and agricultural use due to the impacts of climate change, which has seen less frequent rainfall leading to prolonged drought-like conditions. Villages faced by limited water supply, plus they are not connected to the national grid, solar water pumps are a perfect fit in arid regions such as Dodoma and Singida, where sunshine is generous but surface water is scarce. The water pumps use energy from solar panels to pump water from as deep as 130 meters below ground, ensuring access to water year around.  - -Providing access to water in these villages where there was little or no existing water infrastructure before has not only ensured that the villagers are better able to adapt to changing rainfall patterns and other impacts of climate change but as the distance to fetch water has been greatly reduced, it has also freed up time, especially for women and children, to engage in activities that were previously impossible.-One such activity is the formation of vegetable farming groups engaging in irrigation farming for commercial purposes. While subsistence farming is the norm in villages such as the ones we visited, solar irrigation has now enabled the cultivation of tomatoes, okra, peppers and other crops for sale at the market. Irrigation farming is improving food security in the villages in the face of a changing climate, as well as providing a source of income generation for farmers.-Another positive impact of the increased access to water is that children spend less time fetching water for household and school use. In Ulyampiti, the installation of new water pumps has also improved the safety of school children, as they no longer have to cross the main road to fetch water for school use.-The newly installed water pumps are all equipped with water meters, which allows the measuring and monitoring of water use. Based on the metering, villagers pay a small contribution to a common fund when they use water for irrigation, watering livestock or household consumption. One bucket for household consumption costs around 32 Tanzanian Shilling, and for livestock the price land at around 50 Tanzanian Shilling per head. The fund is reserved for water-related investments approved by the water users themselves. Examples of such uses could be the repair and maintenance of the pumps, solar panels and water pipes as well as investment in extending pipes to nearby villages and other uses the community find useful. The water fund will help to ensure that the positive impacts of the project are financially sustainable.-Although UNDP’s team witnessed many positive impacts in the three villages, there is still potential for more benefits to the communities. In time, enhanced knowledge and capacity to optimize the cultivation of crops according to seasonal changes and the salinity of the water will increase the yield of the irrigation farming. Furthermore, as the water infrastructure is expanded, the area of irrigated land can increase, giving more people the opportunity to benefit from the project.  - ","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Climate change,Goal 15  Life on land,United Republic of Tanzania ,Goal 13  Climate action,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Success Stories,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Energy"

The distribution is part of a nation-wide Grow Garden Initiative, with a special focus on communities that have been disproportionately affected by the food security challenges raised by COVID-19.-Organized with support from the World Food Programme and the Global Environment Fund’s Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP) - the Grow Garden initiative is working with youth, women and families in urban and rural communities, to develop agricultural skills that could help create employment opportunities, food security and improved family nutrition.-Leading the charge to bring a love of agriculture to communities everywhere, is the masked superhero AgriMan, whose mission is to save the world from the villains of food waste and loss, by building an army of young farmers and agriculture-savvy youth. The character, created by WhyFarm, encourages people to farm and help solve challenges in agriculture and food security.-According to Randi Davis, Resident Representative for the UNDP in Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten: “With Covid-19 exacerbating issues of food security worldwide, we’ve been working with our partners to find short-term, nature-based solutions that support our wider, long-term work in building community resilience, women’s empowerment and citizen’s security. Home gardening is about nutrition, yes, but also about so much more. The psychosocial benefits can be immeasurable, as can the way in which it changes our relationship with the natural environment.”-Grow Garden participant, 12-year-old Jordan, a junior member of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Youth Club said: “I’m into the project because it’s fun and it keeps a youth like me out of trouble. I’m looking forward to contributing to food for my family and neighbours. Not being able to physically attend school and interact with people, at least I have an opportunity to focus on something positive. This is my new normal.”
-Commenting on the early impact of the initiative, ASP Ramkhelawan, Head of Community Relations and Police Youth Clubs, Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said: “I see the Grow Garden Project as a vehicle for bringing families closer, in this period of the Covid-19 Pandemic. It not only presents a platform for them to participate in gardening activities together, but importantly it also provides parents and children with the opportunity to improve communication skills, building trust, respect and discipline in expressing their love for each other. It’s not just food that will be growing, but the young people and their families also.

-Over 164 applications, representing various sectors, locations, and vulnerable segments of society, responded to the call. This keen interest demonstrated by the sheer number of applicants, is both inspiring and indicative of the importance that this work will have on enhancing the country’s energy mix through the inclusion of renewables.-The application evaluation process is currently underway. Due to the large number of respondents, only the highest ranked candidates will be notified that they will progress to the next stage of the assessment, which includes site visits and further due diligence screening.-The UNDP, in partnership with the European Union and the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, is looking forward to the implementation of this exciting initiative that showcases the country’s commitment to renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.-The search for suitable sites for the installation of solar energy systems in remote communities begins in earnest this month (July 2020), as the Government of Trinidad and Tobago,  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) kick off  the Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+) project: Support to the implementation of Trinidad and Tobago’s Nationally Determined Contribution.  
-This €2.4M project will support national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, as part of the Government’s ongoing efforts to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement through the achievement of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The multi-year project will also seek to promote a transformative, green economy by demonstrating the benefits of renewable energy and its potential role in creating employment, sustainable development and reducing the environmental risks associated with nonrenewable energy sources.
-The project will see the installation of solar energy systems to support NGOs, microenterprises, cooperatives, public institutions and remote communities at approximately 12 sites across both islands. It will also include the strengthening and implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, legislative and regulatory frameworks, and a public education and awareness raising campaign on the benefits of using renewable energy and adopting energy efficiency practices.
-The UNDP is implementing this component of the GCCA+ project, working closely with the Ministry of Planning and Development, Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries, and the Tobago House of Assembly
-“The global energy transition to sustainable sources is an imperative if carbon neutrality is to be realized in the second half of this century in order to avoid catastrophic climate change. Trinidad and Tobago contributes to that effort through its Nationally Determined Contribution commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation sector. This target cannot be achieved without deploying renewable sources of energy, and this project will contribute towards that end while raising awareness on the effectiveness of renewable energy as the future of power generation” said Kishan Kumarsingh – Head Multilateral Environmental Agreements Unit, Ministry of Planning and Development.
-According to Randi Davis, Resident Representative, UNDP Trinidad and Tobago “Transitioning to renewable energy is critical to achieving the Sustainable development Goals - the UN blueprint for global peace and prosperity, meeting the de-carbonization embodied in the Paris Climate Agreement and making progress towards the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction -  a roadmap for how UN Member States can make communities safer and more resilient to disasters. We believe that this initiative will support the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in building a better quality of life for citizens by securing a more sustainable future, and we are excited to be leading its implementation.”
-H.E. Ambassador Aad Biesebroek underscored the importance of the project, saying, “Climate change is one of the world’s most pressing challenges and the implementation of the Paris Agreement is central to ensuring the achievement of global climate goals.  The EU is committed to working with partners around the world, including small island states like Trinidad and Tobago, that are most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, to achieve their National Determined Contributions under this Agreement. We are happy to be working together with Trinidad and Tobago to bring them closer to the achievement of their national objectives, improving the country’s resilience to climate change and contributing to energy security.”- ",['Icon of SDG 07'],"News,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Success Stories,Renewable energy"

Intubation is the insertion of a flexible tube into the windpipe of a patient to maintain an open airway and facilitate the ventilation of the lungs.-Laryngoscopes enable medical practitioners to view the larynx directly. Video laryngoscopes, like the ones procured for the RHAs, allow the medical practitioner to view a wider area of the airway from a distance thus making intubation easier. This is the recommended tool for intubating patients who are suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19 and is thus an essential tool in the nation’s parallel medical system that was established to treat with COVID-19.-The UNDP Trinidad and Tobago Office continues to partner with the Ministry of Health to improve the level of health care in the Trinidad and Tobago and combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",['Icon of SDG 03'],"Coronavirus COVID-19,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,News,Success Stories"

The Youth Peace Ambassadors Programme which started as a  Pilot with 17 residents, has now been scaled-up to the entire population of over 110 residents. Phase Two of the programme will focus on psychosocial interventions, resilience building and psychoeducation around COVID-19. This innovative programme is supported through UNDP's continued collaboration with UNICEF on youth violence prevention. -The aim of the programme is to teach youth effective coping mechanisms during the pandemic, build their resilience to resist the pull of lifestyles that landed them in the detention centre  initially, and reduce the high rate of recidivism among the population.  An important aspect of the programme is the engagement of the 17 youth from the Pilot, who will now be the leaders, mentors and peace ambassadors as Phase Two is rolled out across the full population.-As COVID-19 safety measures are still in effect, UNDP has turned to video conferencing technology to ensure that the programme continues seamlessly. Working in partnership with the YTRC and psychosocial specialists, the programme utilizes a mix of online classrooms, tutorials, and creative activities, all geared at bringing a humanistic approach to changing the behavior patterns, values and life outlook of the participants. With some of the young people soon due for release and re-entry into the wider society, this intervention is critical to reducing the risk of participants getting caught in a vicious cycle of failed social reintegration, reoffending, reconviction and social rejection.  Building and sustaining peaceful communities is therefore the ethos of the programme.-The launch of the programme began with a segment on goal-setting in which the youth were asked to reflect on their goals for the future. Following this, participants were led in simple yoga exercises geared toward eye health, stress management and emotional regulation in order to prepare them for the virtual classes in the upcoming weeks. The youth enjoyed this session and participated fully in the exercises.  The launch also featured general information  on COVID-19 which was well-received by the youth who were engaged and attentive.  It ended with music therapy in the form of a live steelpan performance streamed digitally from a local panyard. At the end of the session, youth used laptops provided by the UNDP to fill out evaluation forms and provide feedback. It is hoped that the introduction of the laptops will assist in bridging the digital divide often experienced by vulnerable populations.-Participant feedback from the launch has been overwhelmingly positive. Youth noted that they found the information on COVID-19 to be especially helpful. They also enjoyed the yoga. One young person commented, “I love this programme. It shows me my inner self and gifts.” Another remarked that the programme has started to change his mindset and another expressed that the programme could help him prepare him for the workplace once out of the institution.-The latest phase of the Youth Peace Ambassadors Programme with its inclusion of COVID-19 psychoeducation, is expected to help youth cope with the pandemic in a positive way, and provide them with skills to reintegrate successfully into society upon exiting YTRC.-Practicing yoga to improve eye health-Phase One participants are introduced to their role as mentors in Phase Two-Live steelpan performance as part of music therapy-Participants filling out evaluation forms on laptops provided by UNDP/UNICEF",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,Success Stories,Peacebuilding"

This crisis has forced many people out of their jobs, rendering them unable to support their families and children. And the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further curtailed employment opportunities.-With a growing number of people in need of assistance, the Vocational and Business Skills Training and Support Project (VBSTS) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Yemen has responded with crucial support. The project provides Yemeni youth in the governorates of Hadramout and Lahj with the vocational and business skills they need to establish and sustain their careers.
- -Funded generously by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief), the project is implemented by UNDP in partnership with the Small and Micro Enterprises Promotion Service (SMEPS). Furthermore, the support introduces products developed by the trainees to the local market to help the young entrepreneurs grow their businesses.- -As such, the project recently organized a bazaar to market the young entrepreneurs’ products produced by participants from the Tuban District (Lahj governorate) after they completed training and received in-kind grants to help them establish and improve their projects.
- -Juma’ah Saif, a food-processing trainee, says, “The vocational training changed my life for the better. I gained experience and skill and received a US$ 700 in-kind grant from the project. This grant covered the cost of the equipment needed to start my own business, which will save me money and help me be self-reliant and help others,” she added.-Juma’ah is one of many women living in difficult conditions without a traditional job. She received her opportunity for training and support and developed a variety of pickled vegetables that she makes at home. These products provide an adequate income that covers the needs of her family. Today, Juma’ah produces a wide range of products including lemons, cucumbers, carrots, tamarind, and mango pickles.
- -Abdulbari Omar, Project Officer from UNDP’s local implementing partners, SMEPS, says, ""In addition to vocational training identified according to his specialization, the youth received valuable training in business and administrative skills, as well as how to develop a project, and setting plans to start their own business.”-The project helps young people with entrepreneurial projects, assisting them to develop their ideas and providing them with business training while they acquire new skills. “The aim of the bazaar,” says Omar, is ""to promote the beneficiaries' products, introduce them to one another, and connect them to local markets so they can market and sell their products and continue developing their projects.""- -""I have been working in Ma'awaz looming since I was a child, but I needed to learn administrative skills and delve into the more technical side of business.” says Abdulhadi Ezzi. He adds “I learned how to deal with machine breakdowns and how to fix them, and I received US$ 750 worth of sewing supplies.” SMEPS training has changed the way Ezzi views his business. He is now growing his business and has expanded his product line to include different types of Ma’awaz.-Omar Al-Sumati, the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Unit Manager in the Lahj Governorate, talks about the project’s importance for developing rural women's economic self-reliance. “The project plays a significant role in developing community capacity instead of relying upon charitable support. It directly supports sustainability since the benefits continue after the project ends. It is based upon participants’ capacity to develop their projects, market, and sell their products to obtain a sustainable income that helps them provide their needs.”- -The project is especially vital for poor and low-income families, especially those experiencing high prices, deteriorating economic conditions, and interruptions of salary payments. Mohsen Al-Saqqaf, Tuban District’s Director General, says “Today we can see the project’s results in the many professional skills acquired by the trainees in different areas, including food processing. They all presented quality products which will reflect positively on the entire community and will help guarantee them a decent life.”-Nadhrah Mohammed, a food processing trainee, says “I gained multiple experiences and learned to make pickles and pastries, and I was able to set up my own business. Now I work to help my family, and I’m doing well selling my products.”-Huda Abdo’s life is not much different from her colleague, Nadhrah. She, too, is a food processing trainee who used to make pickles at home. ""I joined the training and learned about identifying market needs and marketing techniques to establish and grow my business.” She adds, “I received a US$ 700 in-kind grant to purchase the tools and raw materials needed. Now, I not only support my family, but can also save some money to join the university.”- -***-The Vocational and Business Skills Training and Support Project is funded by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Center (KSrelief) and implemented in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS). The US$ 3,000,000 project helps improve Yemeni livelihoods and access to productive services through provision of training and support in: agro-business and food processing, textiles, and handloom, in addition to technical skills (carpentry, and maintenance of cars, mobile phones and appliances). The project also provides project participants with training on business planning and management.

Every day, it is a struggle for many to find food, employment, medicines, shelter, and to cover their basic needs. Of the little that remains, the prices are inflated to the point where civilians can no longer afford the cost of basic sustenance.-Over 17 million people in Yemen are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity while nearly 2.2 million children under the age of 5 need immediate treatment for acute malnutrition.-Yemen was not in a better situation even before the conflict due to its instability, ailing economy, chronic unemployment, and its dependence on imported goods with up to 90 per cent of its food and 70 per cent of its fuel.-However, the protracted conflict has destroyed livelihoods and businesses. The value of the Yemeni currency is steadily declining; the fuel crisis is ongoing; many public workers are unpaid; and the health system is incapable of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics.-This has compounded the already heavy burdens Yemenis carry. Worry is often pervasive and assumes the form of psychological distress as the concerns about livelihoods, children’s education and health, and costs associated with food affordability and housing, and whether or not they must once again flee the conflict.-Yemen is classified as a fragile country sitting at the bottom of many human, social, and economic development indices as Yemen has suffered conflict and instability for decades. The spread of poverty, hunger, and unemployment goes beyond individual suffering, pulling at the very social fabric, sense of community, and the feeling of belonging. - -Against these daunting conditions, the World Bank – through funding from its International Development Association (IDA) – has worked with UNDP Yemen and the Social Fund for Development (SFD) and the Public Works Project (PWP) – key national institutions – since 2016 to help Yemenis reduce dependency on aid, better their self-reliance and regain their dignity.-Through the US$400 million Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YECRP), the World Bank and UNDP has recognized that if income-generation and livelihood opportunities are restored and increased for the most vulnerable groups (including youth, internally displaced persons), then households will become stronger, better able to cope, and capable of assisting and contributing to their communities.  -The impact of YECRP across Yemen has been tremendous, helping the Yemeni people regain access to key services, earning wages to allow them to purchase basic needs for themselves and their families, supporting their micro and small businesses to improve their income and continue local goods and services, and – most importantly – restoring their dignity. -Creating work opportunities to build back stronger: With nearly 450,000 people (44.6% youth; 21.7% female; 19.9% Internally Displaced Persons/Returnees) provided with cash and work to build back their communities, over 5.5 million people have gained access to lifesaving services, such as water, food, health, education, roads, safe sanitation.-By providing cash together with training and capacity building in a broad variety of skills and creating jobs in small-scale community infrastructure, many Yemenis are employed to build back their communities and are regaining their sense of hope for a better tomorrow. And in focusing on vulnerable families, particularly women and youth, the project has helped the most vulnerable to benefit from short-term sources of income to provide for their families.-Supporting Micro-, Small- and Medium-Enterprises: Not only has YECRP supported national microfinance institutions to continue providing their financial services to over 57,000 micro and small businesses, but the project has also directly provided 16,700 micro and small enterprises across Yemen on the verge of collapse with access to finance, capacity building, and market integration. This has helped improve their income, continue providing local goods and services in their local communities, and create additional employment.-Building food security resilience: As one of the most food insecure countries in the world, the World Bank-UNDP partnership with SFD and PWP has worked together to build food security resilience in Yemen. This has been achieved through rehabilitating nearly 24,000 hectares (approximately 59,300 acres) of farmland and helped nearly 12,000 farmers, livestock keepers, and fishermen (20% female) to increase their production and improve their income.-Safeguarding Yemen’s future: Not only does malnutrition contribute to around 45% of deaths in children (less than 5 years old)[1], but Yemen’s future is also at high risk if millions of its children grow stunted, unhealthy, and weak. This will have irreversible social and economic impacts for decades to come.
-To address that, the World Bank-UNDP’s partnership with SFD has recognized the comparative value of conditional cash transfers over direct food distribution. They have provided not only monetary support for over 200,000 mothers with malnourished children to purchase nutritious food, but also focused on building their knowledge and good practices on child nutrition and care to keep their children healthy and strong. This has resulted in over 115,000 children under the age of five being treated from malnutrition.-Investing in local capacity: The unique foundation of the World Bank-UNDP partnership in Yemen is working together with key national partners – SFD and PWP – to maintain and shore up their capacity and ensure they continue to deliver their lifesaving services to millions of Yemenis and support to vital recovery programmes.
-Both SFD and PWP in Yemen provide a model of how rewarding it is to utilize and invest in existing local and national capacities to deliver development aid in crisis affected locations, while using a community-based approach. The approach focuses on empowering and working directly with local communities in compensating for the limited capacity or absence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as the weakness of local governments.-By encouraging community ownership – and them determining priorities that will enhance the quality of their lives – communities actively participate in the planning and construction of infrastructure that will change their lives.- -Building upon the success of YECRP, UNDP and the World Bank have signed another two funds – the Social Protection Enhancement and COVID-19 Response Project (SPECRP) (US$ 61.4 million) and Yemen Food Security Response and Resilience Project (FSRRP) (US$ 23.8 million) – to scale up their emergency response and support for social protection interventions and food security resilience through cash transfers, livelihoods restoration, and provision of key services.-Through IDA’s support and partnership in Yemen, UNDP and the World Bank are ensuring that support reaches the most vulnerable communities and institutions that have been otherwise cut off from traditional financing. This support is necessary for the resilience of the population and fragile communities; it is crucial in post-conflict reconstruction and creating a sustainable recovery.- -[1]https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/children-reducing-mortality#:~:text=Malnourished%20children%2C%20particularly%20those%20with,under%2D5%20years%20of%20age. - - ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,World Bank,Success Stories,Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 13  Climate action,Crisis response,Yemen,Sustainable development,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

However, developing and crisis-affected countries like Yemen are more vulnerable to climate change. Yemen’s protracted conflict has led to a state of instability resulting in untenable development patterns that increase climate hazards – especially in rural communities directly dependent upon ecosystems – to meet basic needs.-Climate change affects everyone, but often increases gender inequality, particularly in rural areas where women are primarily responsible for providing the family's needs for water, cooking fuel, and energy. Women may not have ability to voice their views or talk about their resource or service needs that help them adapt to climate change.-But the gender-based business model applied by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of the Enhanced Rural Resilience in Yemen’s (ERRY) solar activities helped remove the economic, social, and cultural barriers that hinder women's participation in climate change adaptation interventions. -Iman Hadi, a young woman living in a village located on the conflict lines, was able to break societal restrictions. As a woman living in the Yemeni countryside of Abss, it was not easy for her to run her own business in solar energy. Her father, brothers and some from the community were opposed to the idea of Iman running a solar power plant.-Iman knew from the very beginning that having a career would be challenging, including the social constraints that created obstacles for many female entrepreneurs in Yemen just like her. However, her determination and persistence helped her overcome these hardships. Her success in business has helped to fundamentally change the beliefs of the rural community about women, their rights, capacity, and the important role they play in the context of conflicts and crises.-Iman has proven that women can and should be seen as active agents and promoters of climate change adaptation and mitigation.-Iman not only succeeded in providing clean low-impact energy for residents in Abss, Hajjah Governorate but was recently announced as one of BBC’s most influential women for leading positive change and making a difference during Yemen’s turbulent times.-Since she started her business three years ago with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU), the number of customers has increased from 25 to 48 and the net profit has reached YER 2,210,000 (approximately US $3,684) – a significant sum in rural Yemen.-Iman's success in running and growing a small enterprise in solar energy showcased the significance of engaging women in climate-related activities to ensure the sustainability of results, thus mitigating effects induced by climate change.-Iman is an inspiring community influencer. Her success was the first spark for the implementation of 163 solar microgrid enterprises in rural Yemen, helping crisis-affected communities sustain themselves and survive the crisis through income creation and energy generation. One solar micro-grid contributes to the reduction of 53,236 kilograms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the past four years, and the 163 microgrids significantly contribute to reducing almost 2.17 kt (Kilo Ton) emissions of GHGs resulting from fossil fuel-based energy supply for a year.
-Iman always felt a sense of responsibility towards her community. Because of this, she invests in her fellow community members and strives to raise awareness of the importance of green energy to enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities to crises and climate change. Thanks to Iman, other women will be given the opportunity inside and outside Yemen to establish similar solar enterprises that will promote the use of green energy as an efficient alternative source of energy.-Iman’s ambition is even stronger despite the challenges she has faced and her perception as an entrepreneur has changed. She plans to expand her business through potential investors willing to provide funding for her to expand. Shifting from a recipient of humanitarian assistance, Iman has blossomed into a successful business owner and social influencer.-Iman’s message to Yemen’s women continues to be: “Do not stand where you fail. Strive with determination and confidence and your dreams will come true.”-In total, UNDP and its partners the Sustainable Development Foundation (SDF), Care International, and For All Foundation (FAF) have installed 13 solar microgrids in four vulnerable governorates of Hajjah, Hodeidah, Abyan & Lahj, benefitting more than 44,000 people. 713 individuals were trained in solar power system installation, maintenance and business management to help establish local solar power businesses and ensure the sustainability of renewable energy systems in Yemen.-***-These activities were implemented as a part of the Supporting Resilient Livelihoods and Food Security in Yemen Joint Programme (ERRYJP II)  co-financed by the European Union (EU) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 13  Climate action,Yemen,European Commission,Sweden,Sustainable development,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Success Stories,Renewable energy,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

One such effort is the Vocational and Business Skills Training and Support Project that provides rural youth with a range of professional, technical, and commercial skills. By helping to encourage entrepreneurship with the youth, it increases their employability and productive engagement in the recovery of the local economy.- -In response to Yemen’s crisis, UNDP has forged a partnership with the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS) and the support of King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) to conduct a training programme in the district of Al Raidah and Qusaier in the Hadramout governorate. The programme is designed to provide training to participants with theoretical and practical knowledge related to vocational businesses and trades of their choice. The training helps the youth acquire the skills necessary to establish and maintain their own businesses. It also facilitates economic growth and nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in the society.-“The information and skills I learned from the business skills and food processing trainings were very useful,” says Nawaf Al-Jariri, a programme trainee. “The project grant will definitely contribute to improving my work and increase financial revenue. My project will also create job opportunities for my family and community.” Nawaf adds that he was supported with some equipment and special materials as part of that grant.
- -Fatima BaHashwan, a food processing trainee in the programme, indicates that she has “...acquired a lot of skills and expanded my knowledge of my profession.”. She adds that “The grant will improve my business and help increase my income.” Fatima is passionate about her dairy products business that she plans to expand and open her own dairy products store.-The UNDP/SMEPS vocational training covered several areas including food processing, carpentry, textiles and handloom, fishing nets maintenance, and maintenance services.-Aisha BaWazeer, one of the food processing trainees says, ""The theoretical and practical vocational training was my kick-start in entrepreneurship. I acquired the knowledge and necessary skills for project management and sustainability."" She adds, ""Now I can set up my yogurt and pickles-making business because the grant has provided me with the necessary tools and materials."" Aisha hopes that her project continues to grow so she can help her family. She would like to use the profits to also fund her children’s school and create a better life for them.
- -Helping these young people to establish sustainable businesses is not limited to ensuring income for their families, but it also complements the efforts to revitalize livelihoods which will contribute to the economic recovery in the country.-“The training has expanded my knowledge and helped me develop new skills,"" says Amin Salem, a carpentry trainee. ""I can now run my carpentry workshop efficiently. I am determined to develop my business and become a pioneer in this field,” he adds. “I’m already getting good offers in the carpentry and furniture-making industry. The grant I received covers the cost for the equipment and materials I needed the most for my business. All of that will have a significant impact on my income and my living conditions.”-As part of the training programme, all participants also receive a theoretical grounding in their various fields. They then advance to vocational and technical training where they learn from experienced and professional trainers in their specialized areas. In the final stage, participants develop their business plans and receive the basic tools and equipment they need to put what they have learned into practice.
-Anas Saeed Bin Faraj, one of the fishing nets maintenance trainees, describes his financial situation as difficult. “I was unemployed and I had difficulties working,” he explains. “The programme helped me work and make a living. I came up with a plan for a fishing net business with the help of the business advisors,” he adds. “Now I’m working, and I can meet my family’s needs.”
-Shaker Mohammed, a car mechanic trainee, explains that the training programme is a milestone in his life as it has boosted his car mechanic’s skills. “The grant I have received will help me get new and modern equipment to improve my workshop capabilities,” he explains. Shaker is determined to develop his business, especially since there is a high demand for car maintenance services.-""I am passionate about weaving and I want to start a Ma'awiz weaving business. This training is the first step towards achieving my dream,” says Siham Mahrous, a textile weaving trainee. “This training has equipped me with the necessary skills in business management,” she adds, and will “change our life and improve our living”.
-***-The Vocational and Business Skills Training and Support Project is funded by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Center (KSrelief) and implemented in partnership with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS). The US$ 3,000,000 project helps improve Yemeni livelihoods and access to productive services through provision of training and support in: agro-business and food processing, textiles, and handloom, in addition to technical skills (carpentry, and maintenance of cars, mobile phones and appliances). The project also provides project participants with training on business planning and management.

The cooperatives and miners within the space work tirelessly to convert development minerals like quartz, silica, river sand, and granulite into valuable goods ready for industrial and commercial use.-ASM is a broad field, encompassing the creation of value from a range of raw materials to produce goods such as bricks and paving stones for construction, quarry dust and silica for use in the mining industry, granite and gemstones for counter tops, jewellery, and decorative items for retail.-UNDP has been working collaboratively with the Government of the Republic of Zambia, through the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development to provide opportunities for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining projects through the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) Secretariat, with finances from the European Union (EU). Through the Accelerator lab, the ACP-EU Development Minerals project intends to expand the scope of this support to include supporting local innovators to participate in the Development Minerals value chain, leveraging government deliberate focus on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. The Accelerator Lab and Minerals Development project embarked on a solutions safari through Zambia’s Southern, Copperbelt, and Eastern provinces, where the team met with cooperatives and artisanal miners as well as innovators to discuss their processes, gauge their concerns and to extract suggestions and innovative ideas for growth within the sector. These conversations revealed a need for ASM geared innovations within the machinery fabrication and digital platform development spaces.-Many of the cooperatives and miners shared that the tools that are readily available for their sector are either not portable enough for them to make effective use of them on site, too expensive or incredibly manual. For example, rock quarry miners break boulders, crush rocks, sieve materials and transport the final product to the sales floor using a combination of picks, hammers, shovels, and improvised sieves, and sacks/buckets that exposed the users to health risks. Further, individual miners need to produce between 1 and 2 tons of product to receive a reasonable payment for their goods. With the current tools, this process takes anywhere between 2 to 3 months. Often, miners within cooperatives either have to procure piece work from or offer piece work to other miners to quicken the process or supplement their earnings.-

Often, miners within cooperatives either have to procure piece work from or offer piece work to other miners to quicken the process or supplement their earnings.-
The miners shared that tools such as portable crushing machines, fortified hammers, movable and portable conveyor belts systems, and loading aids, could improve their productivity. Lucy Nakawala, the Chairperson of Zimba Mines Cooperative in Mufulira, noted in Bemba that “Excavators, crushers, wheelbarrows, and other tools will make our work very easy. Currently, we have to carry the stones and products with buckets on our heads”.-With these tools, the miners explained that they would have capacity to boost their own productivity, scale up their operations, and improve the regularity of their earnings. The cooperatives demonstrated a preparedness to purchase these items and other relevant innovations by pooling their collective resources together, should they have access to the right suppliers.-Moreover, there was a general trend across the development mining space that indicated limited market access as an additional challenge. As the local market is currently not fully aware of the wide range of development minerals available for purchase locally, potential customers skew towards imported goods under the perception that these products do not exist in Zambia or that the quality does not compare to imported goods. This positions the miners, and their cooperatives to rely on middlemen and become/remain susceptible to price setting by customers. This tends to undervalue the cost of production and leave the miners’ earning less than they would with broader market access.-
The miners explained that by reaching out to local markets and presenting their goods for display at fairs and in stalls, local consumers would be made aware of their goods, their value, and availability. “We don’t have a challenge sourcing material, our biggest challenge is finding where to sell the stones. If you look around the industry, you find that most [sellers] say they have got a lot of stones ready for market but unfortunately, we have limited people that can buy stones in bulk... We would like to step out on the weekends to go and market our products in town and in public spaces” says Joseph Mbewe, a gemstone cutter from Ndola. Mbewe adds that he is interested in using digital platforms and that he has the tools to support digital marketing, but he has concerns about security online, saying, “We have computers and I have a phone that uses the internet, the only thing is learning how to go about it so that we don’t meet with fraudsters on [social media] and we don’t lose out in terms of security.”-In conversation with the Gemstone Processing and Lapidary Training Centre (GPLTC), it also become clear that digital marketing solutions could evolve in the ASM sector now and in the future, potentially promising a wide reach for the cooperatives to markets across the country and beyond without the dependence of a middle person. -
After engaging with the miners, the team explored the fabrication and innovation space by meeting with key strategic partners like the Northern Technical College (NORTEC), GPLTC, and Chipata Trades Training Institute. These institutions confirmed the team’s hypothesis that there were facilities and opportunities for fabrication and machining locally. By tapping into the wealth of resources in the form of lathe machines, sheering and cutting machines, and Computerised Numerical Control (CNC) machines amongst others, this will open a door to a world of options – a world in which innovative minds connect to the right tools that can convert their ideas into prototypes and then tangible products ready for industrial use by the ASM sector.-
Local innovators like Darius Mambwe and Charles Bensaia are but two examples of the massive potential for the practical execution of innovative ideas that are directly geared at the ASM sector. From used car parts and second-hand motors sourced from the open market, to bottles and melted plastic waste, they have created simple solutions to complex problems from locally available and recycled materials.-
As the mining industry is often characterised by unsustainable practices and a widespread negative environmental impact, the novel thinking of these innovators and the local ASM machinery fabrication space offers an opportunity to approach and align both machining and production towards more environmentally sustainable practices.-The next stage will consist of designing strategies to draw out these innovators and connect them with the networks of tools and resources needed to execute their ideas. Further, by connecting innovators and the systems that can actualise their concepts into tactile products within the ASM sector and the end-users, the ideas and challenges of the miners and cooperatives will be directly addressed in the development of machinery and platforms.-This also presents an opportunity to generate awareness and sensitise the local market to the wide range of valuable and locally produced goods to be found in the ASM sector – challenging local perceptions of development minerals and locally manufactured items.-As the field is dominated by women and the youth, the hope is that through catalysing innovations within the sector, the project will be accelerated towards achieving SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.-

Peace has returned home,” Evaristo said.-Now Evaristo steps in when domestic disputes erupt in his rural community in Chongwe District and is part of a nationwide drive to enlist men as advocates for women’s rights.  Through the Men’s Network, he and other men raise awareness aimed at shifting traditional patriarchal attitudes towards women and girls.-“My involvement in the Men’s Network has taught me that there are many ways of solving domestic disputes without having to resort to violence. I now preach anti-violence message, he said.-Rising Wave of Violence-Zambia is one country with the highest prevalence rate of 90 percent gender-based violence (GBV) among five countries in the-Southern African region, according to a recent study by the Southern African Development Community (SADC).-Despite significant successes in combating GBV in Zambia, cases are still high with 2020 third quarter recording 4,620 cases while third quarter 2021 recorded over 4,000 cases.-Gender activists here say highly entrenched patriarchal tendencies at community level perpetuate GBV due to the power imbalances between men and women and boys and girls. At personal level, there are high levels of tolerance of GBV by the survivors leading to a reluctance to report such incidents.-Although some types of GBV are being classified as felonies in the Penal Code and carrying a high mandatory sentence, there is still high incidences of GBV such as defilement, Intimate Partner Violence, rape, property grabbing and assault.-“Despite progress made in providing comprehensive post-GBV services, the service delivery gap remains as many some people remain under-served, especially in hard-to-reach areas due to a multiplicity of factors including the direct and indirect costs of accessing services. Inequalities between men and women in terms of access to assets, resources and opportunities contribute to disempowerment of women and children and this makes them susceptible to abuse and violence,” one gender activist said.-Aiming to tackle these issues, a programme sponsored by the Government and the UN in Zambia, led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has been working with communities to raise awareness and engage men and boys in gender issues to promote positive masculinity.-With financial support from the Governments of Ireland and Sweden, the GRZ-UN Joint Programme on Gender-Based Violence Phase II encourages men to be loving, caring fathers and partners who are supportive of gender equality and women’s empowerment.-Gender Champions-Back in Chongwe District, Evaristo Muyayama said his group is trying to make men part of the solution, by identifying “gender champions” and convincing those men to speak out in community fora and on community radio against violence and to promote gender equality.-Supported by UNDP, local communities in the district have trained men and women on community engagement, gender and human rights issues and methods for working with men to combat GBV. Those receiving the training then transfer their skills and knowledge to village groups – each with up to 50 members.-Once trained, advocates disseminate success stories and work with traditional leaders to end violence against women through yard meetings and other community gatherings. They also advocate with religious leaders to spread anti-violence messages during weekly prayer services.-Armed with awareness materials, bicycles and mobile phones, community members create forums for men and women to discuss issues that contribute to GBV such as alcoholism, gambling, domestic violence and polygamy. The approach uses personal stories of change to help men in the community work towards non-violent and more equal relationships with women and girls.-“My husband has stopped beating and abusing me,” said Luyando, Everisto’s wife, whose husband’s transformation has emboldened her to refer friends to the same service.-Peter Tembo, 36, a maize farmer who used to be physically and verbally violent to his wife has become the person that neighbours and authorities rely on to mediate domestic disputes in his community.-“We’ve started at home, by training our own boys,” he laughed. “We want them to grow up with the mindset that boys and girls have equal rights.”-All Hands On Deck-Working with national institutions, the Zambia National Men’s Network for Gender and Development has established 12 boys’ and 24 men’s networks around the country to provide information and education to raise awareness on the role of both men and boys in preventing GBV and positive masculinity.-“These networks are expected to put men and boys as drivers of social change and challenge harmful masculine stereotypes which perpetuate domestic violence in communities,” said Shupe Makashinyi, UNDP Gender Programme Coordinator.-The networks meet often and talk about local reports of domestic violence and how to strengthen support services for survivors. They also engage with known perpetrators about the negative effects of GBV. In some cases, they apprehend perpetrators and turn them over to the police.-“It’s a good idea to involve us [men] in fighting violence in our homes because we have the power to change our own attitudes by talking to and counselling each other,” says a gender champion, vowing to encourage more rural men to become campaigners for women’s rights to end traditional harmful practices such as child marriage and invest in the well-being of girls and women in their communities.-The men’s network has also incorporated social institutions such as schools, media organisations and churches to make the fight against GBV widespread and practical. According to their declaration, drawn in September 2021, “We note that without concerted efforts to address Gender Based Violence and other forms of gender injustices, the lives of women and girls in the country remain a risk. We commit ourselves to fight all forms of Sexual and Gender Based Violence in order to close the gender gaps in our communities.”-“Communities need to be aware of the importance of providing support and protection to women and girls so that they can live free from violence. UNDP, and indeed the UN System in Zambia will continue to support the country to end gender-based violence which remains central to the government’s development agenda,” says Lionel Laurens, UNDP Resident Representative in Zambia.-With the help of the United Nations, the government has rolled out the Victims Support Unit in all police stations across the country as part of a broader government policy to curb the rising wave of violence against women and girls thanks to funding from the Governments of Ireland and Sweden.-In each police station consisting of a reception, interview and counselling room, rest area and an office where victims can report cases of physical and sexual abuse to police officers who have been trained to specially handle such cases.-Strengtheing Coordination and Response Services-Under the GRZ-UN Joint GBV Phase II Programme, the approach to attain successful results includes Prevention and Response strategies, use of efficient institutions and systems such as One Stop Centres, Anti-GBV Shelters, Anti-GBV Fast Track Courts and village-led and community development one stop centres for survivors. Another key strategy is to strengthen the coordination of prevention and response mechanism on GBV.  The enhancement of male engagement as agents of change against GBV cannot be overemphasized to curb GBV.-With support from UNDP, Zambian advocacy groups such as Legal Aid Clinic has pushed to get as much legal and emotional support to women as possible, knowing this knowledge could help protect them.- ","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Africa,Zambia,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 5  Gender equality,Women's empowerment,Gender equality,Success Stories"

She wants to be an electrical engineer with a nation-wide impact, and with an education and access to supportive institutional structures, she believes she can achieve her goal.-“I want to be the first female electrical engineer from my village. I wish that my gender wouldn’t be a barrier to achieving my ambition. My dream is to help improve power generation in Zambia beyond hydroelectricity,” she says.-For many girls in Zambia and beyond, dreams like these are often stifled by several social and economic factors including poverty and a prevalence in Gender Based Violence (GBV) in their communities.-Marrying off girls once they reach puberty is a deeply engrained custom in traditional societies like Zambia, but with detrimental effects on health, education and development. Child brides are likely to drop out of school, curtailing opportunities and realization of their full potential.-Three in ten Zambian girls marry before they turn 18: one of the highest rates in the world, despite child marriage being illegal in the country.-With support from the GRZ-UN Joint Programme on GBV Phase II project, the government has set an intermediate goal of lowering the rate with a view to build “a Zambia free from child marriage by 2030”. The Zambian government has instituted a national response to address child marriage by launching a multi-stakeholder anti-child-marriage campaign. Structures to fight child marriage have been put in place including a civil society coalition against child marriage.-Funded by the Governments of Sweden and Ireland, the project is partnering with national institutions such as the Zambian National STEM Foundation and the Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) to encourage young women and girls to pursue a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).-Working in collaboration with these national institutions, the GRZ-UN Joint Programme on GBV Phase II project recently organised career talks with successful women to tap into the desire of girls to change their country for the better through STEM education.-The summit was attended by 80 high school girls from Chisamba, with interests in STEM related careers. Joined by the Zambian National STEM Foundation, ZICTA, and the First National Bank (FNB) through their H.E.R initiative, the GRZ-UNJP team shared the space with the young girls in attendance, informing them of the opportunities and structures available to them.-The session shed light on the vast career prospects available to young girls and further enlightened the girls on the freedom, independence, and fulfilment to be found in STEM related fields.-“The place of girls is not to be housewives, but at school,” says Henry Nkhoma, Director of Gender and Development within the Gender Division in the Office of the President.  He said the government considers child marriage as an act of violence and is making efforts to end the scourge which is deeply rooted in the society.-""With the right orientation, there is no limit to what women and girls can accomplish. Opportunities to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (#STEM) will make them critical thinkers and innovators,” - UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Zambia Roland Seri.-The gathering served as a reassurance to the young girls of their place in STEM. As a historically male-dominated field, the summit was an assuring reminder of the value to be mined when girls and women are included in these key development fields.-“Through such initiatives, talented and brilliant-minded girls like Rachel and her peers can be encouraged and equipped to break into and claim their rightful places in the world of STEM and other spaces like it,” says Michelo K. Moonga, Executive Director of the Zambian National STEM Foundation.-In this way, Moonga said young girls can create their own spaces within these fields, act as catalysts for change and key facilitators of inclusive development and, inevitably, minimise their risk of falling into the limiting and harmful cycles instigated by GBV.  -As a resolution to the direct and powerful words of Rachel, “I wish that my gender wouldn’t be a barrier to achieving my ambition”, the career talks presented the girls with a platform to amplify their own skills with the support of systems meant to break down structures and institutions that limit girls and subjugate them to GBV.- ","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Africa,Zambia,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Success Stories"

The sad incident occurred in Kalikiliki, a highly populated residential area in Lusaka, where safe and clean heating and cooking solutions are elusive.-This unfortunate case is typical during the cold season currently being experienced in the country. During this season, most homes resort to home heating measures that are hazardous despite the dangers associated with them. Clearly, the reasoning behind such a decision is that charcoal is a cheaper heating and cooking solution especially for households where the main electricity gridline is not available, or the cost of electricity is beyond their pockets. Challenging situations as befalls the young Kalikiliki family are ripe grounds for solutions that promise relief and a promise of a safe living environment.-Becoming an Innovator: searching for a solution-In the district of Mansa, despite being the Provincial headquarters of Luapula province, many households heavily rely on the use of charcoal as the source of energy. Like many rural districts where electricity supply is not regular, traditional lighting and heating is the only form known in the homes despite the risk and harm to the environment as a result of deforestation.  This situation is what led 28 years old innovator, Mervis Ngosa, to begin her own safari in search of safer, cleaner and cheaper cooking and heating solutions for households heavily dependent on these unsustainable heating methods.-Mervis’s recollection of how she started her innovation dates back to her hometown, “I come from Samfya then moved to live in Mansa. We used charcoal and firewood as our main sources of energy. I witnessed so many disastrous accidents associated with these energy sources that I started thinking and investigating ways of using alternative sources of energy. I discovered that copper slag can be one such alternative.”-To her delightful discovery, Mervis realised that the copper by-product or slag, is used as an abrasive tool, for road construction, and ballast. Although many have realised its use and potential, much of it is disposed in dumps or stockpiles.-She discovered that copper slag is not flammable but stores energy.-“From what we have gathered, the copper slag stove uses very little charcoal or better still can use twigs or maize husks. But what is interesting is that The exciting part is that the slag when heated, spreads the heat around the stove to make it hot for a longer period so that even after burning out, the stove remains very hot.”-From ashes to beauty: How UNDP Identified Mervis for Innovation Acceleration-It was in 2020 when the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), National Technology Business Centre (NTBC) in collaboration with the Zambia Information and Communication Technology (ZICTA) hosted the inaugural National Innovation Initiative (NII) Fair, where Mervis participated and show-cased her innovation.-The NII is a joint initiative aimed to map out existing local innovations across Zambian communities with a view of supporting the most promising initiatives with the highest potential for social and economic impact. The Fair targets local innovators, technology-based start-ups and creative innovations that are solving societal challenges including the ones that help address the current COVID-19 pandemic.-Fifty (50) innovators from 10 provinces across the country were identified through a thorough and elaborate process of scouting, interrogating and recruiting these innovators who then participated at the Fair.  Only twenty (20) of the most promising and impact driven projects were selected to receive a cash award of K50,000 to help develop their innovations. Though not among the top 20 awarded, Mervis’ innovation was not to be ignored.-“I did not win but I came out of the competition a better person. A person more determined to apply what I heard and what I needed to improve”.-Although Mervis did not win, her innovation did impress the judges and key stakeholders who requested for her participation in the Experimentation Programme aimed at testing and iterating the innovations for possible  scaling up and commercialization. Under the Climate Change and Energy Experimentation Programme, which leveraged on existing projects in the areas of climate change and energy to support the NII finalists and Waste Management Innovation Challenge finalists by testing their products and improving their product design and models. The programme focuses on helping develop the commercial viability of the innovations, co-implemented with the National Institute for Scientific and Industrial Research (NISIR) and Copperbelt University (CBU). The initiative also aims at imparting technical and business development knowledge and skills in the targeted groups for the successful commercialization of their innovations. The initiative is expected to provide financial support to the best innovations in various selected categories. -Under the tutelage of the CBU, improvements were made to the design of the stove and measures put in place to cater for the safety of the stove for home use. The team are also exploring the use of briquettes to completely do away with the unsustainable use of wood or charcoal.-The slag stove by today, has now built-in all its components so that they are no longer visible; the slag and the twigs are equally hidden from the ordinary eye.","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs"

My business had been doing well but COVID-19 has pushed me in an awkward situation. Feeding my family is another daily worry,” said the 53-years-old widow whose only wish is for the coronavirus to “go away soon.”-Catherine’s situation mirrors many vendors, mostly single mums in Zambia who are reliant on income from day-to-day commerce on the streets and in crowded markets to put food on their table.-The vast majority of Zambia’s marketeers are women who, according to United Nations data, account for most of the over 65.4 percent of Zambians who work in the informal sector. The pandemic has increased the debt burden on these women and pushed their families to the brink of poverty.-Marketeers like Catherine are particularly vulnerable not only because of the premium on space in the markets, but traders touch paper money and coins all day, which can transmit the virus. Moreover, overcrowding also makes social distancing impossible in the markets where tracing carriers and their contacts is a major challenge.-“I’m praying that COVID-19 doesn’t enter the shanty communities and the markets because if that happens, it will be very disastrous for Zambia,” says Catherine.-According to government figures, an estimated 70 percent of the urban population in Zambia resides in informal settlements, housing millions of people, where the key to containing the spread – frequent hand washing and social distancing - are not feasible.  Families in many slum communities also live in just one bedroom, making the space for self-isolation impossible to reduce the chance of infection.-Zambia has seen a sudden surge in deaths and case numbers since early May, leading to fears about the strain on the health service.  Zambia's COVID-19 positivity rate, which was around five percent for most of April, rose to 19 percent in June. Active cases increased to over 900, from around 400 at the start of the month, according to the health ministry.-The southern African nation has recorded since the beginning of the pandemic in March last year more than 149,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 2,000 deaths.-Health experts fear the respiratory disease could have a catastrophic impact on a country with a shaky healthcare system and where access to basic sanitation and clean water for hand washing are out of reach for many in mostly densely packed communities.-However, with support from UN entities and cooperating partners, the government has put in place a series of public health measures including mandatory mask wearing to curb the transmission rate.-Since mid-June, the government has closed schools temporarily and banned super spreader events including weddings, saying large gatherings risked spreading the COVID-19 virus.-But for traders like Catherine, losing daily wages because of COVID-19 health measures severely threaten their ability to feed their families.-Eager to regain her livelihood hit by weary buyers, Catherine knows one way to stem the spread of COVID-19 is through individual and collective actions. So she signed up as a volunteer on the Health Committee of a small community market in Lusaka’s Nyumba Yanga under the pilot phase of the Safe Markets, Safe Communities project, an initiative aimed at ensuring that community markets are compliant to COVID-19 public health regulations while protecting livelihoods.-The project is implemented by the Lusaka City Council and the Ministry of Health with co-funding from the Governments of Sweden, Ireland and UNDP Accelerator Labs with support from the Government of Zambia and the United Nations Joint Programme on Gender-Based Violence Phase II (GRZ-UN JP GBV).-The Safe Markets, Safe Communities project works closely with the departments of public health from the City Council and the Ministry of Health through established community structures namely Community Based Volunteers and market committees from three residential areas of Nyumba Yanga, Chilenje and Lilanda.-Armed with basic training on safety and hygiene, face masks, thermometer and messages approved by the Ministry of Health, Catherine Mulapa walks 3 kilometers every morning from her house to the market not only to sell perishable vegetables and fruits but to do a job few others would contemplate in a pandemic - check the temperatures of arriving buyers and fellow marketeers.-The mother of five is not a nurse or medic of any sort - just one of hundreds of ordinary Zambian women who are battling the virus in their communities. “I help sensitise people on the benefits of marketeers wearing masks and the confidence it gives to customers,” she said.  -At a small community market in Lilanda, health committee member Emma Nanyangwe, 49, is seen checking the temperatures of arriving buyers, dispelling myths and educating people about the dangers of COVID-19. “With everyone wearing a mask and social distancing, marketeers and buyers are feeling safer,” Emma said.-Fruits vendor Cecelia Banda from Lusaka’s Chilenje Market and her family have been dependent on her income from her business, which has dwindled due to the coronavirus pandemic. With four children to feed, the 42-years old said the virus has created “a mental burden” for her and it affects her family’s income.-“I want my livelihood back! I come here every morning, making sure that both buyers and sellers comply with health regulations so that we are all safe,” she says.-As transmission of the third wave of the coronavirus spreads, market officials say women like Catherine, Emma and Cecelia are essential foot soldiers in the war on COVID-19. “They already have a wide range of knowledge and experience from dealing with cholera outbreaks to malaria prevention in the markets,” one market official said.-According to market officials, the three markets have been a lot safer - compared with other markets - because of the intervention. “We haven’t had a single COVID-19 case at our market since the project started last year,” another official said.-Catherine, Emma and Cecelia are among 1,900 traders including 950 women trained by the project to spread awareness about the virus, identify people with symptoms and help trace those with whom they may have had contacts.-As an entry point, 75 community-based volunteers and market safety officers were also trained using existing community health training modules with the aim to reach households at community levels on the importance of complying to health guidelines.-To support compliance among vendors and customers, the project provided face masks, fumigation equipment and thermometers as well as soap and water dispensers so people can wash their hands before entering the markets. For continuous awareness on safety and hygiene, communication materials on how to wear a face mask and how to make a cloth mask using local materials were provided.-With implementation support from UNDP Accelerated Labs and funding from the Governments of Sweden and Ireland through the GRZ-UN JP GBV, the Lusaka City Council and the Ministry of Health are making efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 amid fears it could have disastrous effects for the country’s shanty communities and market areas most prone to contagion.-“The project is strengthening knowledge as well as individual and collective responsibilities toward adhering to public health regulations and preventing the spread of the deadly virus in our markets,” says Lusaka Deputy Mayor, Christopher Shakafuswa who is now contesting a parliamentary seat in the capital, Lusaka.-The Swedish Ambassador to Zambia, Anna Maj Hultgård said that the project would ensure gender equality and the empowerment of women by implementing affirmative action for sustaining women’s economic activities in the selected markets. “The safe markets project is an example of efforts to reduce vulnerability to Gender-Based Violence by addressing the economic disempowerment of women resulting from restrictions around COVID-19. The safe markets will enable women, which are the majority of traders in the market, to continue trading in a way that minimizes or at least limits the risk of COVID-19,” she said.-Through UNDP support, several educational materials have also been created and shared to support the outreach effort in communities across the country. UNDP is working together with other UN agencies to end the scourge, as well as helping the government develop a national recovery strategy. This aims to rebuild the livelihoods of those most affected and strengthen the government’s capacity to restore essential services.-An enhanced UN-wide response provides psychosocial interventions which are helping to prevent infection through water, sanitation and hygiene services.-“UNDP is supporting the Safe Markets initiative as part of the UN Zambia support to the Government’s response to COVID-19. UNDP hopes that by collectively rethinking and adapting existing market models to COVID-19 Compliant Models, community behaviour will be positively impacted, thus leading to the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 arising from community ownership while preserving the livelihoods of communities,” says UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Roland Seri.-“The pandemic has put the life of everyone at stake, but we will get over this difficulty if we all do what is needed to keep safe,” says Nora Ngosa, head of the Chilenje Market.  She said the swift and early action by the Safe Markets, Safe Communities project is helping to make community markets safer, noting that constant vigilance is needed to beat COVID-19.-Zambia has long raised public health awareness through TV, radio spots and songs. Radio stations play COVID-19 awareness jingles on repeat and encouraged residents to stay safe. TV stations air sensitisation programmes to help viewers learn more about COVID-19 and its consequences, but also to promote ways to avoid its spread within communities.-While the government and health experts see social media as a fast and efficient way to help a large number of people, mainly youths stay healthy during the outbreak, not everyone is able to go online whenever they need information about the virus.-And then there is the challenge of getting information out to everyone in a population whose members practice a variety of cultures and speak a vast array of local languages. Radio broadcasts and door to door sensitisation have been the most efficient means to raise awareness in local languages and fight stigma arising from the pandemic, especially in most-at risk communities.-“There is a need to scale-up the Safe Markets, Safe Communities initiative and increase awareness,” says Benjamin Mungole, head of the Nyumba Yanga Market, “so that ignorance does not facilitate the spread of the virus.”-UNDP’s Gender Programme Coordinator, Shupe Makashinyi, said the pandemic could lead to a rise in all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic violence (based on anecdotal reports from partners) and UNDP intends to scale-up the Safe Markets model to help address the impact of COVID-19 on women and girls in the context of Gender Based Violence.      -“Social and economic strains - compounded by COVID-19 restrictions - could potentially make women and girls more prone to physical and sexual violence, ” she said.-There are no official statistics on the number of cases of violence against women and girls during the pandemic in Zambia but calls to helplines had supposedly surged more than 10-fold when the partial lockdown measures were imposed last year.-Market officials say the safe markets model can be instrumental in helping women vendors - giving them greater autonomy and access to services as well as life-saving information.- ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 5  Gender equality,Women's empowerment,Success Stories,Accelerator Labs"

Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. According to experts, between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is born with intersex traits"".-Source: UN Free & Equal-“Being intersex, I would bluntly say, it’s not easy,” says Mphatso Sakala.-Mphatso is one of the up to 1.7 percent of people born intersex – or people born with sex characteristics that do not fit the typical definitions of being male or female.-“For me growing up, I noticed the difference when I was just in my primary school years,” he says. “But I came to understand that I was intersex, and that people like me are intersex, when I started asking questions and trying to find out who I really was.”-Mphatso is the Founder and Director of the Intersex Society of Zambia (ISSZ). The organization, which was founded in 2018 and started operations in April 2019, is seeking to ensure inclusion of intersex people across social, economic, legal and policy spheres. In their short existence, they have made some impressive accomplishments through determined advocacy and awareness raising, including building visibility in the media, on social media and producing the Afric Intersex Podcast.-Since 2019, ISSZ and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) have engaged in a partnership to advance intersex inclusion and equality, through the Linking Policy to Programming project which aims to strengthen HIV and sexual and reproductive health-related rights of young key populations in Angola, Madagascar, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. - - -Together, ISSZ and UNDP are working to ensure that children born with differences in sex characteristics can enjoy their full human rights, are not stigmatized or discriminated against and lead productive and fulfilling lives. The inclusion of intersex people, and other sexual minorities, is core to the Sustainable Development Agenda, and its principle of “leaving no one behind.”-“In Zambia, especially when it comes to traditions and religion, there are a lot of myths attached to someone being born intersex. For some, they'll say it's a bad omen, they’ll say it’s a punishment for the sins your parents committed in the past,” he explains. “So it is surrounded with a lot of stigma and discrimination, and a lot of secrecy. Often, families would prefer to just keep that information within themselves in order to run away from the issues of stigma and discrimination.”-Motivation to persevere and create positive change for his community comes from Mphatso’s own lived experiences and supportive family. “It comes from the things I went through. I thought – if I’m able to talk with people, if I’m able to share the issues we are going through, why can't I be a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves?”-In this journey of understanding the needs and promoting the rights of intersex people in Zambia, Mphatso is working with UNDP, which is supporting the work of the organization and its members. One of the main interventions UNDP is supporting is the development of a Medical Management Protocol for Intersex Persons in Zambia which is being developed in collaboration with the Zambia Medical Association and the National AIDS Commission. The protocol is mainly intended to guide medical professionals on the management of infant intersex cases. -Though data on corrective or normalization therapy in Zambia is limited, there are indications that such procedures for babies is provided at health facilities. These medical interventions are often based on the physical features at the time and are heavily influenced by doctors and parents, rather than consent from the individuals themselves (who can be very young). Furthermore, the interventions are generally irreversible and can result in disruptions to their physical and psychological well-being. Such practices are advised against by human rights advocates and current scientific literature.-The Medical Management Protocol, which is in line with the Zambian Constitutional rights to dignity, life, self-determination and right to health, instead will promote the provision of comprehensive health services that includes psychological support and counselling to the child and family as an alternative.-“The Intersex Management Protocol is very crucial in that when an intersex person is born the first contacts are with medical practitioners, and we've come to understand that in most cases, they don't have any sort of guide on how to proceed with intersex cases,” reveals Mphatso.-“Having this protocol will assist medical professionals to know how best to work with intersex persons and it will serve as a guide for them.”-The goal will be for the protocol to be adopted by the Ministry of Health and rolled out nationwide, ensuring that children born with differences in sex characteristics can enjoy their full human rights, are not stigmatized or discriminated against and lead productive and fulfilling lives. It is expected to be the first such guideline in the Southern African Development Community.-In addition to the protocol, UNDP is also engaging with ISSZ to conduct a policy review on legal recognition for intersex people, which will examine the challenges faced by this community and make recommendations for policy reform. Intersex people sometimes do not identify with the sex or gender they were assigned at birth and can find it difficult to access basic social services and fully participate in society as a result.-“Being able to legally change the sex marker on our official identity documents will have a significant impact towards reducing the social exclusion that we face,” says Mphatso.-It is hoped that the partnership with UNDP will bring about significant and positive change for the lives of intersex people in Zambia.-“I’d like to call on people to start taking an interest in and understanding the issues of the intersex community,” says Mphatso. “Being born intersex does not make you less of a human being, we are all human beings, and we have human rights which need to be protected.”- -To learn about the Linking Policy to Programming project, visit our website.-UNDP acknowledges and thanks the Intersex Society of Zambia for providing photographs and for cooperating on the development of this story.- ",['Icon of SDG 10'],"Africa,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities"

In 2016, tobacco was responsible for the deaths of over 7,100 Zambians or roughly 6 percent of all deaths, costing Zambia nearly 140 lives every week. Each year, tobacco costs the Zambian economy ZMW 2.8 billion, equivalent to 1.2 percent of its GDP.-The investment case indicates that fully implementing and enforcing the selected WHO FCTC priority interventions is a highly cost-effective way to reduce the burden of tobacco. If all six tobacco control interventions are implemented and enforced, the Government will be responsible for saving 40,349 lives over 15 years, and could save ZMW 12.4 billion over 15 years. Implementation and enforcement of the six tobacco control measures will help avert ZMW 685 million in healthcare expenditures over 15 years.-This tobacco control investment case was developed jointly by UNDP, the WHO FCTC Secretariat, WHO and the Ministry of Health as part of the FCTC 2030 project.",[],

While health clinics do exist in the resettlement areas of Meheba, they serve to primarily respond to the primary health care needs of the migrant and host communities and no measures have until now been put in place to strengthen GBV response for the populace.”-The GBV One Stop Centre functions as a key node for provision of comprehensive support against gender-based violence to protect the diverse community in Meheba Resettlement Scheme and surrounding areas, comprising Angolans, Congolese, Rwandese and Zambians.-Meheba Resettlement Scheme, like many other communities in Zambia, have experienced challenges with the availability and coordination of GBV services. Despite the efforts by line ministries of the Government, such as the Department of Resettlement, Office of the Vice President, and other stakeholders to respond to GBV, the area has continued to record an increase in the incidences of GBV, especially violence against women and a lack of coordination to manage GBV survivors, which spurred the establishment of the Center.-Development of the Centre is in line with the 7th National Development Plan (2017 – 2021) that emphasizes an integrated and multi-sectoral approach in all areas of social and economic development, as well as the principle of “leaving no one behind”. This model of response is multi-faceted and comprehensive and combines a package of services to GBV survivors within reach. The key stakeholders involved in the provision and coordination of services to GBV survivors include the Zambia Police Service, Ministries of Health, Social Welfare, Community Development, as well as civic and traditional Leaders, working together to provide any array of services including health, legal, justice, counselling, psychosocial support, protection and long term prevention of recurrence of GBV to survivors.-Mr. Andrew Banda, Director, Department of Resettlement, Office of the Vice President, expressed his gratitude to the financial contribution of the Government and People of Japan as well as the technical support of IOM for the instrumental training of staff for the centers and the rehabilitation of the physical infrastructure.-The GBV One Stop Centre, established at a cost of USD 75,000 will provide multidisciplinary GBV services to survivors and will be used as a Centre for education in GBV and data management. Subsequently, this will lead to a better understanding the realities of GBV and promote the establishment of a GBV free society.-A second GBV OSC was also established and equipped in Mayukwayukwa Resettlement Scheme, and the facility was handed over to the District Health Director during a low key administrative ceremony on 27 March 2020, in recognition of the COVID 19 containment measures.

As part of its support to the government, the UN in Zambia will strongly advocate for both leveraging digital solutions in the fight as well as their mainstreaming in any national recovery or development plans post COVID,” said Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio, the UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia when she handed over equipment to the government.-“Rebuilding better will require societies where digital transformation plays a critical role in all aspects of the national recovery plans, from the reduction of digital inequality to the development of opportunities leveraged through digital access and the closing of the internet gap,” Dr. Gadio said.-In appreciation, Zambia’s Minister of National Development Planning Alexander Chiteme said the COVID-19 crisis has brought new needs for digital government services and more demand on existing digital services. ""This donation could not have come at a more opportune time than now when we are operating in the new normal which requires adequate administrative tools to upscale the usage of digital platforms such as virtual meetings, as opposed to physical interaction, reduction on paper and transacting electronically with stakeholders and clients.”-“The launch of the Pilot Phase of the Digital Initiatives will play a catalytic role for the acceleration of e-governance initiatives in the medium to long term with lasting impacts beyond the delivery of the public service. Through the development of a scale-up programme, questions related to e-trading, e-commerce and digital transformation to close the gap for women and marginalized populations as well as the enhancement of digital financing options and digital inclusion for the most vulnerable groups could be addressed,” said Lionel Laurens, UNDP Resident Representative in Zambia. “UNDP stands ready to support and explore opportunities that will ultimately lead to stronger e-governance capabilities in Zambia.”-UNDP is working closely with the Government of Zambia and within the United Nations System to ensure that assistance is aligned with the country’s national priorities and response strategy. In addition, UNDP is working with the Ministry of Youth, Sport and Child Development through UN Volunteers to deploy community youth volunteers across the country for door-to-door sensitization, as part of a UN system-wide support to strengthen community preparedness and response, thus underlining the fact that to defeat COVID-19, as well as other epidemics, it will take a whole-community approach.   Already, with the deployment of 500 community youth volunteers in Lusaka, most-at-risk communities in the capital are taking the lead in the prevention of  coronavirus through health and hygiene promotion. The involvement of communities is paying off in the fight against COVID19 as their action and resilience, using lessons from the fight against epidemics such as HIV, TB & malaria to fight COVID-19 are saving lives in #Zambia.-UNDP also provided technical support in terms of training to the Zambia Police Service, culminating in the launch of its Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for COVID-19. The SOP serves to safeguard human rights particularly of vulnerable citizens and provides guiding principles to security and law enforcement officers in responding to the pandemic.",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Success Stories"

Lusaka, known as one of the fastest developing cities in southern Africa (IPA, 2016) accounts for over 50 percent (RTSA, 2016) of all fatal road traffic crashes in the country with pedestrians and cyclists representing 50.3 percent (RTSA, 2016) of all victims.-What seemed as a normal daily routine for most school-going children and local commuters, left Ketty Nyirenda (19 years old) with indelible facial and bodily scars, when an unlicensed mini-bus driver hurtled off the main road to the scantily provided pedestrian walk-way where Ketty met her life threatening experience.-Vividly recounting her ordeal, which also left her emotionally broken, Ketty explains that most roads do not provide for pedestrians, making their safety impossible, “I am impressed with the current road developments, but they still do not cater for pedestrians and cyclists. Longer and wider walkways for pedestrians can significantly enhance safety by reducing the possibility of pedestrians sharing the roads with motorists. As pupils we practically share the roads with motor vehicles.”-Although walking constitutes for about 62 percent (JICA, 2009) of the total daily urban movement in Zambia, road networks have little or no space for pedestrians and cyclists. This has forced them to be relegated to the margins of the roads, exposed to motorists.-The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) recognizes these inadequacies of the current road network and the needs by majority of the road users, Local Government Permanent Secretary, Bishop Eddie Chomba states, “the government conceived the Lusaka Decongestion Project, which was launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Local Government and its local authority, Lusaka City Council (LCC). The aim of redesigning the major road network of Lusaka city is to reduce traffic congestion, travel time and distances, and to save on fuel consumption. The project was initially conceived of in 2008 in conjunction with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)”.-Having suffered as a traffic victim, and understandably not wanting to see anyone in her shoes, Ketty wishes that her experience could improve the current approach and design as Lusaka city is currently bursting with modern infrastructures from shopping malls to sprawling modern suburbs and importantly highways that are expected to contribute to decongesting the roads. She, however, believes that the development of new roads, if they are going to be relevant to all including pedestrians and cyclists, should include protective pedestrian barriers, to separate motorized transport from Non-Motorized Transport (NMT).-“I have always asked myself why me. What could have happened differently? Then it occurs to me that authorities also need to take responsibility for the kind of infrastructures they are building. The roads will add beauty to our city but if they don’t design them to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists are protected, these developments will mean nothing. Protective barriers are perfect examples. They separate motor vehicles from pedestrians, making it hard even for a vehicle that has lost control to have direct impact with a pedestrian,” she added.-The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) sees the Lusaka Decongestion Project as a necessary initiative to reduce the levels of traffic congestion and traffic pollution on the streets of Lusaka. This is also a great opportunity for Lusaka to make the roads more inclusive and increase the number of pedestrian walkways and cycle lanes.-UNDP Officer in Charge for Inclusive Growth and SDGs, Jan Willem van den Broek says, “We are pleased to see that the Government of Zambia is recognizing the need to cater for safe pedestrian and bicycle paths, as walking and cycling play a fundamental and unique role in the efficiency of urban transport systems. Walking and cycling lanes can not only make the roads safer, but also contribute towards improved health, cleaner environment and generally save money for the poorer communities, as they save on transport”.-He points out that it is for this reason that together with the GRZ, UNDP has developed the Pedestrian First project. “This project is in line with the 7NDP,  as it recognizes that while transport and communications are critical for economic growth and poverty reduction, if appropriately designed, transport strategies will contribute to reduced inequalities, allow for access to basic services, that adequately meet the needs of all, including people with disabilities, contribute to the reduction in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through exercise, reduction of pollution from city traffic and lower Zambia’s carbon foot-print. Ultimately the project is expected to turn Lusaka into a more livable city” said Jan Willem van den Broek.-In keeping with its role of integrator of Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations System, UNDP has collaborated with the Ministry of Local Government,  the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Road Development Agency (RDA) and the Road Transport and Safety  Agency (RTSA) to develop the Pedestrians First project, an innovative approach to inclusive growth, which could help see a more user-friendly pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure within Lusaka and other cities. This will contribute towards reducing traffic accidents, enhance the wellbeing of Lusaka city dwellers and lead to improving sustainable mobility in Zambia.-Much to Ketty’s delight, who wants to be a road safety goodwill ambassador and has been collaborating with the RTSA to raise awareness on the need for pedestrian and cycle lanes, Pedestrians First Zambia also seeks to advocate for change of attitudes and priorities toward Non-Motorized Transport users, like pedestrians. Ketty laments that much of the advocacy work does not include community members, “if everyone can get involved in the road safety campaign to promote pedestrian walk-ways, we could save so many lives. Currently, the few officers have not yet managed to penetrate all our communities.”-It is against this backdrop that the UNDP Resident Representative, Lionel Laurens stresses that the project’s advocacy component, which has been spearheaded by the RTSA, requires the involvement of a broad range of stakeholders to be more successful and impactful and see genuine behavior change. To this end, the project will encourage and seek the participation and engagement of the private sector, Civil Society Organizations (CSO) and ultimately all citizens of Zambia.-“The change of mindset and attitudes can contribute to achieving more livable cities. Together we can reduce poverty and attract more investment simply by making Lusaka one of the most pedestrian friendly cities in Africa. The provision of bigger and wider road networks is important, but may not lead to less accidents, if pedestrians and cyclists continue to be relegated to the margins of the roads. Public private partnerships will be pursued to advance the objective of improving wellbeing in Lusaka by converting it into a more livable city that upholds principles of sustainable, safe, comfortable cities to create triple benefits: improve health and safety of its citizens, protect the environment and mitigate climate change and contribute to economic development by facilitating transport and mobility of all including the most vulnerable fringe of the population. Ultimately, this will contribute towards transforming Zambia into a nation of healthy and productive people as outlined in the 2017-2021 7NDP.”- -

I saw women nurse orphaned or displaced children who are not theirs. I saw women fail to communicate violations and despair. I had never seen such pain in my life, where women could go for days without water, not because they did not want but because there was no access to water.”-Munganga-Chanda’s experience in Darfur whilst serving as a patrol officer meant protecting civilians, revealed the reality of the suffering of Internally Displaced People (IDP), especially women, children and the elderly.-The UN reveals that over 70 percent of those killed in armed conflicts are civilians with a disproportionate impact on women and girls, who suffer from unprecedented and multi-faceted challenges such as sexual violence, displacement, loss of life and economic upheavals.-This acknowledgement has led various stakeholders to employ strategies that would encourage and support more women to join Formed Police Units (FPU) in a bid to ensure women’s participation in peace processes. The strategies designed are in accordance to the UN Security Council, which called for more women’s participation at peace roundtable discussions through UNSC Resolution 1325 adopted in 2000. -Recognising Zambia’s commitment to peacekeeping and years of embracing refugees and providing shelter and security, the High Commission of Canada in Zambia in partnership with UNDP Zambia organized a roundtable discussion to propose modalities and means of how Zambia, through ZPS, could develop its first Formed Police Unit  - a police peace-keeping unit - which would ultimately mainstream gender in its composition.-The round-table discussion was facilitated by UNDP under the auspices of its Governance programme, which is underpinned by the desire to support the promotion of just, peaceful and inclusive societies as envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is anchored by the General Assembly resolution 71/243 in its seventh preambular paragraph from the UN Secretary General to the Security Council on the United Nations policing.-UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Roland Seri noted in his opening remarks, that “a reformed police service is crucial for peacefully managing and transforming conflict, dealing with societal grievances and fostering sustainable development. This illustrates how peacekeeping acts a powerful lever for the promotion of the sustainable development agenda, which is the reason why the UNDP has been associated with the programme”.-He also underscored that UNDP has been working with the ZPS in numerous areas and at various levels to strengthen the institution in order to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs 5, and SDG 16.-An FPU, according to Mr. Seri, is the backbone of the UN Police and inherent part of peacekeeping. 
-Seri said, “FPUs play a critical role in supporting UN Operations to maintain or restore peace and security in war-torn or post-conflict countries through the provision of a range of services around three core duties; Public order management, Protection of UN staff and facilities and Support to police operations requiring concerted response to (non-military) threats”.-The roundtable discussion heard how the resolution has led to an increased attention to gender mainstreaming with specific reference to promoting women's participation in peace processes, increasing the numbers of women at all levels of decision-making institutions, and increasing partnerships with local women's organizations, which is expected to increase women's participation in the UN in senior positions, as Special Representatives and in peacekeeping missions and operations.-Ms Munganga-Chanda who was a participant at the roundtable discussion recalled her years as an Individual Police Officer (IPO) in two PKOs by underscoring that there is need for more women to participate in PKOs as it gave women IDPs comfort, connection and freedom to express themselves in various concerns, which could otherwise be left untold.-“As fellow women it was our responsibility to give them emotional support because there is a language between women that crosses traditional and cultural barriers. Just our presence gave women IDPs confidence and trust. We went further and ensured the provision of social and self-sustaining skills,” said Munganga-Chanda. She observed that the effects of war on women IDPs cannot easily be verbalized because many of the experiences she witnessed left her in tears.-ZPS was specifically chosen because of the country’s leadership in UN peace operations and as a trailblazer in women’s participation rates.-According to Mr. Mark Haynes, the Canadian High Commission Liaison Officer, a significant component of the Elsie Initiative is the establishment of bilateral partnerships with one Police Contributing Country, and one Troop Contributing Country. He said, “after a great deal of consideration, analysis and country visits, Canada reached out to both the Ghana Armed Forces and Zambia Police Service to be our bilateral partners, and we are delighted that your political and police leadership accepted. This partnership was approved by 4 Ministers in Canada, and announced by Zambia’s Minister of Home Affairs, in September 2018 at the UN in New York”. -Seeing this as opportunity rather than a challenge, Munganga-Chanda opted to take a chance on her ambition to help affected women in countries of armed conflict. Her dream was fulfilled because of the social and economic empowerment programmes she was able to participate in to empower women IDPs by building their confidence and abilities to be self-sustaining. Apart from sharing skills in human rights issues that border on gender-based violence, she was Chairperson of the UNAMID Policewomen’s Network, Munganga, a network of Policewomen established to promote and empower women to take up leadership positions in the mission. The network also lobbied for greater number of women in the mission.-“Upon seeing that the numbers of women in the mission was dwindling, we would lobby for more women to be recruited. We also ensured that the women in the mission did not return home the same but that they attained more skills. For example, we encouraged women IPOs to apply for leadership positions and professional jobs in the mission. As for the female Sudanese police officers, we held capacity-building workshops on gender-mainstreaming and confidence building activities,” said Munganga-Chanda.-Munganga-Chanda was also head of the UNAMID Police Component Public Information Office. Having served as ZPS Public Relations Officer, this was not new but a function that exposed her to providing communication support between the Mission and the populations it served. Importantly, was the support she gave to Darfuri women on their rights as well as building their capacity through skills training. She has since become a member of the Elsie Committee in Zambia, an initiative by the Canadian Government.-Launched in 2017, the initiative aims to increase the meaningful participation of women in UN Peace Operations in police and military forces.-Because of her skills and role in peacekeeping missions, where she was able to be of professional support as a Public Information Officer, Munganga-Chanda has been around the country with the Elsie Initiative sensitizing women officers to join peacekeeping operations. She is now a stronger person because of what she experienced in the two missions. She does not take peace for granted. She is now a more resilient woman.-The roundtable discussion was amongst the many areas that UNDP has been working with the ZPS on strengthening institutional capacity.

Her Return to Work plan, which was submitted to TEVETA draw enough attention and interest. Subsequently, she trained 15 males and 15 females who are now available for employment with technical skills in in road paving using cobblestone techniques.-“I was identified by the Association of Women in mining in Zambia to participate in the initial training in cobblestone paving. This was due to my passion in the area of small-scale mining particularly as it relates to not-so-expensive minerals such as cobblestones. I applied for the advertised course and participated for 28 days. I was amongst the 57 women and youths that were trained. The Return to Work component is what triggered my interest in writing a proposal to TEVETA, which they accepted and trained my 30 identified members”.-Like many young Zambians, Georgina’s employees are amongst the many people who are unemployed. They are young and they are female. Young people in Zambia represent at least 36 percent of the country’s 17.6 million people and yet they continue to be under-represented in socio-economic activities with unemployment rate at its highest at 7.79.-In 2018, the UNDP’s programme on inclusive growth and poverty reduction organized a programme that would contribute towards empowering youths through employment. In partnership with the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development (MMMD) and supported by the Africa Caribbean Pacific-European Union Development Minerals Programme, the project provided capacity building opportunity to over 50 youths and women. The training supports the active use of cobblestone, whilst others are in value-addition and sale of Development Minerals in local markets. Many others earn a livelihood by supplying goods and services to Development Minerals operations.-Lyapa Manza, the UNDP Project Manager had this to say:-“The aim of the project was to build capacity amongst the youths and women with a focus on empowering them in all relevant aspects of cobblestone cutting, chiseling and laying techniques as a means for employment. The capacity building activities under the development minerals programme is to increase the sector's productivity; better manage mining operations; adhere to national and international environmental and health standards; and prevent conflict through effective community relations. Specifically, the training for 2018 was focused on providing a programme that brought together individuals from all over the country and interested in the value addition of cobblestones”.-Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) has become one of the most important means of Development Minerals in Africa, and Zambia has discovered that it can contribute to unlocking women’s and youth employment opportunities.-This programme has brought renewed hope among young people and women in Zambia, as it is being promoted at a time when the Government through the Road Development Agency is promoting the use of development minerals (cobblestone) in road paving through the Pave Zambia 2000 Project.-The cooperative, according to Georgina, expects to begin tendering for works with Pave Zambia 2000. She hopes that the cooperative will be an opportunity for self-employment and empowerment to the many youths in the cooperative.-The programme as a UNDP initiative is earmarked to benefit over 4,300 youth and women, who will be participating through the “return to work” initiatives that involve setting up cooperatives and small-scale companies to create work opportunities and lift people out of poverty. The aim of the return to work component is to support graduates with practical components once in the field.-This project is funded by the ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme and is a three year, €13.1 million capacity building programme that aims to build the profile, and improve the management, of Development Minerals. The programme is an initiative of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, financed by the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and implemented by UNDP and Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development.-The ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme is implemented at both the regional and country levels. At the regional level, the programme conducts capacity building activities with participants from forty ACP countries through regional training workshops, field trips, the production of guidance products and knowledge exchange. The programme will also host a final conference to enhance the knowledge sharing activities con-ducted during the programme. Participants of regional training workshops implement the skills and knowledge that they have gained from the training through return to work plans. At the country level, in depth capacity building is under-taken with six focus countries: Cameroon (Central Africa); Guinea - Conakry (West Africa); Uganda (East Africa); Zambia. (Southern Africa);Jamaica (Caribbean);and Fiji (Pacific).-Cobblestone mining and paving in other parts of the world is a commonplace since ancient times.",['Icon of SDG 01'],"Poverty reduction and inequality,Goal 1  No poverty,Inclusive growth,Success Stories"

The joint delegation headed by Zambia’s Minister of Energy, Matthew Nkhuwa, had arrived to pay a courtesy call on Chief Kabamba the 7th of the Lala people of Serenje District and to inspect the proposed site for a mini-hydro power station to be constructed at the Chipota Falls in his chiefdom.- -The 200-kilowatt mini-hydro power station would be constructed by a UNDP-supported project to promote the transfer of renewable energy technology from China to Zambia using the South to South cooperation model. The initiative is a partnership between the Department of Energy in Zambia, the Ministry of Science and Technology in China and the UNDP Country Offices in Zambia and China and it’s being funded by the Government of Denmark.  The partnership seeks to increasing access to energy through off-grid and community-based electrification - thereby indirectly supporting other socio-economic and environmental objectives, most notably poverty reduction through employment generation and supporting action on climate change mitigation and adaptation. This initiative is a key component of UNDP’s support to the implementation of Zambia’s Sustainable Energy For All. Statistics on Zambia’s national electrification are grim. Despite its huge energy resource endowment, less than half (31.4 percent) of all Zambians and only about 4.4 percent of those living in rural areas have access to electricity, according to the Department of Energy.-""Rural Electrification Authority has earmarked off-grid solutions such as the development of the 300kW Lunga mini-grid in Luapula Province and the 200kW Chunga mini-grid. All these efforts are being made in adhering to our national rural electrification target of 51 percent by the year 2030.” Hon. Mathew Nkhuwa, Minister of Energy,-“Our goal is to provide catalytic support to Zambia to increase the use of renewable energy such as solar-off grid technology to cushion the country from the adverse effects of climate change. This will act as a catalyst for enhancing rural development through promotion of better conditions for women to access better education and health services”. Mandisa Mashologu, UNDP Country Director.-Ms. Mashologu also disclosed that an estimated 15,000 people are expected to benefit directly from the clean energy to be generated by this mini hydro. For Chief Kabamba in whose chiefdom the mini-hydro power station would be constructed, it was all smiles as 200 kW of reliable power would make it possible to effectively irrigate crops, boost farming yields and fuel economic growth in his chiefdom.-Chief Chibamba said Schools will become more productive and health facilities more accessible. This will help our children study under clean light without any irritation to their eyes and patients will be able to access health services during the night.- -With unreliable electricity, many rural families in Chief Kabamba’s area are often forced to rely on kerosene or paraffin lanterns as a primary source of lighting or burning wood, which emit soot and toxic fumes. Experts say this not only can lead to premature death due to diseases but can also cause fire accidents and burn injuries in addition to fueling deforestation.-But the project is not just about going green. It also aims to empower women in the male-dominated, conservative district, where child marriage is rife, and girls are routinely denied an education and live a life largely confined to home. To help get power to those who have never had it before, means vaccines can be refrigerated without disruption; health workers no longer need to work by torchlight at night, including when delivering babies and school enrolment would be improved. With this initiative, Kabamba Chiefdom in Serenje District is on the verge of a boom with a mini power grid that could stimulate the rural economy, empower women and bring jobs to rural communities.","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 13  Climate action,Energy efficiency,Environment,Success Stories,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Renewable energy"

And with the training facility created within the Department of Physics and fitted with a solar array, she is excited and can now explore her passion for renewable energy.- “The Solar Energy Centre of Excellence will give me foundational knowledge of renewable energy,” she said with satisfaction. ""My goal is to work harder to achieve my dream and make a name for my country and family, she said, wearing a jeans and black t-shirt.-The establishment of the Solar Centre in Zambia creates a good platform to support the growth of the solar energy industry through training, testing of equipment and physical demonstration of solar technologies,” Zambia’s Ministry of Energy Matthew Nkhuwa said when he officially opened the centre in November last year.  -This initiative at the state-owned university was facilitated by a UNDP-supported project to promote the transfer of renewable energy technology from China to Zambia using the South to South cooperation model. It is being implemented by the Ministry of Energy on the Zambian side and Ministry of Science and Technology on the Chinese side with funding from the Government of Denmark.-The aim of the demonstration and testing facilities is to provide physical facilities with space for equipment suppliers to exhibit, and centre staff to conduct tests of equipment and publicly report on performance to facilitate the orderly development of the renewable energy market and assist Zambian entrepreneurs.-“This centre of excellence is a key contribution and opportunity for Zambia to showcase and provide a practical demonstration of how renewable technologies can accelerate transformation through partnerships,” says Mandisa Mashologu, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Zambia.-Mandisa sees much more use of solar energy ahead for Zambia. “The low electricity access in Zambia means that there is a big market and potential growth, which provides good business opportunities for the private sector to make their contribution to development needs as Government cannot do this alone,” she said.- -The UNDP Resident Representative said her agency remains committed to supporting the Government and people of Zambia in all its efforts to achieve universal access to affordable and clean energy and working towards the SDGs under the 7th National Development Plan and Vision2030.-Also speaking at the launch, the Economic and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Zambia, Ouyang Daobing, reaffirmed his country’s commitment to helping Zambia meet its development challenges, especially meeting its national rural electrification target of 51 percent by 2030.- In appreciation, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Zambia, Prof. Luke Mumba lauded the support and said the initiative will help Zambia develop its own capacity and reduce dependence on foreign expertise.",[],"Environment,Success Stories,Renewable energy"

The main objective of the training was to enhance UNDP country office capacity to design, implement and monitor timely crisis and post-crisis livelihoods responses that promote a rapid return to sustainable development pathways. Critical cross-cutting issues, such as gender equality, environmental and social sustainability, private sector partnerships, and knowledge management and innovation, play a key role in the roll out of the CRP.-Crises erode development investments, challenge the capacities of vulnerable groups, and frequently overwhelm national authorities. They hamper poverty reduction efforts and stop or reverse progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. In the context of humanitarian situations, UNDP as a development actor engages in early recovery activities, preventing local and national capacities from deteriorating further, and beginning to build foundations for longer-term recovery - even while humanitarian efforts are still unfolding. It is important to note that, just as emergency relief activities are crucial to saving lives by responding to the most urgent human needs, integrating an early recovery approach within humanitarian operations is crucial to the first efforts of a community to recover. It prepares the ground for an effective ‘exit strategy’ for humanitarian actors and contributes to ‘durable solutions’ by establishing the base on which nationally-led development occurs after a crisis.-In responding to crisis, UNDP is guided by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 which was adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction. In addition, UNDP adopted its new Strategic Plan 2018-2021, which clearly emphasizes the importance of integrated solutions for resilience and recovery, and places UNDP as a pivotal actor to promote innovative solutions, knowledge management, private sector engagement and to support the implementation of the SDGs in all development contexts. UNDP believes that the focus on recovery and recovery planning after a crisis should begin as early as possible.  But the principles of early recovery are also relevant prior to a crisis.  Before a crisis, UNDP’s development perspective focuses on capacity development and national ownership which helps ensure that nations, communities and people are more resilient to recurring or predictable crises and are better prepared when faced with a crisis such as drought, floods or hurricanes. At global level, UNDP leads the Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery (CWGER) which focuses on four main lines of action:  (i) Providing direct strategic and coordination support to Humanitarian Coordinators (HCs), Resident Coordinators (RCs), Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, Humanitarian Country Teams (HCTs) and Cluster Lead Agencies at the country level; (ii) Defining and coordinating early recovery work that is not covered by other clusters (e.g. governance, non-agricultural livelihoods);  (iii) Providing initiative and guidance on the integration of early recovery in the work of other clusters, and inter-cluster coordination of early recovery; and (iv) Influencing the global policy agenda on humanitarian financing, civilian capacities, and strategic planning to strengthen the potential for, and impact of early recovery within international crisis response and recovery efforts.-At the country level, UNDP helps to integrate early recovery approaches into the humanitarian response through programmatic interventions, advisory services and coordination of the early recovery working group and mainstreaming of early recovery in other disasters. UNDP works with the affected country and its humanitarian and development partners (e.g. local authorities, civil society organizations and the private sector) to design and implement programmes needed to help people move from humanitarian assistance to development. It undertakes capacity building of national and local authorities to enable them to take over the coordination of programmes from humanitarian actors, many of whom are international agencies and organizations. UNDP also play a role in assisting countries and their people to prevent crises as well as recover from them. This includes supporting disaster risk reduction (DRR) interventions, particularly in countries affected by recurrent crises.",[],"Crisis response,Gender equality,Success Stories"

UNDP Bahrain Country Office (CO) joined the YLP in its third edition (YLP3). Since then, and through working with the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs (MYS), local YSOs, and the YLP Bahrain Community (consisting of YLP alumni, facilitators, and speakers), the YLP Experience has been shaped through a collaborative effort in the Kingdom of Bahrain, contributing to the UNDP’s Country Programme Document and the UN Strategic Partnership Framework in Bahrain, while engaging with the priorities of the Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2019-2022.-Under the title of “Creating Change from Inside Out,” The YLP7 in 2021 focused on the topics of Wellbeing and Mental Health, exploring the reality and challenges in Bahrain through looking at the interconnection of individual, community and planetary wellbeing, and how addressing all levels of wellbeing could galvanize the achievement of the SDGs.-Guided by the exploration of these topics, a close collaboration between UNDP and MYS, along with five YSOs – AIESEC Bahrain (AIESEC), AlMabarrah AlKhalifia (MKF), Ayadi Relief Organization (Ayadi), Global Shapers - Manama Hub (Shapers), and the Rotaract Club of Bahrain (Rotaract) – was established. With a representative from each organization and two YLP6 alumni the programme formed the National Committee (NC), who worked together to design, plan, and implement the YLP7 Experience. The programme this year has been exclusively and generously sponsored by Abdulrahim AlKooheji Foundation (AKF), as part of a wider partnership to support youth and youth-serving organizations capacity in contributing to the achievement of the SDGs.-Building on the “YLP Experience” learning module developed during YLP6 (2020), the YLP7 Experience became a 2-month long capacity training and social innovation development programme. The programme consisted of 14 dynamic and engaging virtual workshops, that were delivered by 15 trainers and speakers, which included local professionals, members of the partner YSOs, and UNDP experts. The participants learnt about the SDGs, social innovation, wellbeing, gender equality, systems thinking, the design-thinking process, and the art of storytelling, all within the context of real challenges present in Bahrain.

Youth Leadership Programme: Past, Present and Future-Over the last 6 years, UNDP in partnership with Youth-Serving Organizations (YSOs) has been working, training, building the capacity of youth to enable them to be the drivers of development and progress in their countries and communities. Generalized training have been delivered ranging from the introduction training in the Sustainable Development Goals, Gender Equality and Equity sensitization to Social Innovation. Design Thinking has been used as a methodology to support young people create solutions to problems, they are most passionate about. These past 6 years have demonstrated the creativity, agility, and eagerness of young people to support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in the region as partners. With less than a decade left to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is vital that youth are empowered partners.

UNDP Bahrain country office joined the Youth Leadership Programme in its third edition (YLP3). Since then, and through working with the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, local youth-serving organizations, and the YLP Bahrain Community (consisting of YLP alumni, facilitators, and speakers), the YLP Experience has collaboratively and steadily been shaped in Bahrain.-Every country in the Arab region does YLP slightly differently based on the local context and needs, and in Bahrain, UNDP Bahrain works closely with its partners to unlock the potential of young people in Bahrain and foster their active role in achieving the SDGs. The YLP6 team did this last year by developing the YLP participants' social innovation ideas through facilitating virtual dynamic workshops and inviting inspiring speakers. The young participants then created groups that focus on a strong social innovation idea and worked together to present it to a local judging committee, where the winners then joined the YLP Regional Forum to present their ideas and connect with other young social innovators across the region.- -Young men and women have the potential to drive significant change and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, they face several challenges making it difficult for them to reach their potential as changemakers.-Changemakers can be defined as young people striving to make a positive impact on their communities by implementing a community-based project, being active in shaping national policies that support their communities and country and running social enterprises that create jobs while addressing a social issue.-Youth in the Arab region are born into and up against complex realities that make their roles as changemakers all the more challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic and its stressors in the Arab region are set against a backdrop of protracted crises and instability, of poverty and famine, of discrimination and exclusion, of high unemployment and economic collapse. In many cases, these realities have perpetuated for generations, so that the traumas experienced by youth today are woven with the generational trauma they carry from decades of stress and tension.-The context in which youth in the Arab region are coming of age cannot be controlled; but to the best of the UNDP’s ability, its role is to support youth’s desire and commitment to implement positive change. In addition to the technical skills required to advance their change-making ideas, young people need to be equipped with tools to cope with stress and to ride the waves of unpredictable circumstances.-Under the title of “Creating Change from Inside Out,” The YLP7 will focus on the topics of Wellbeing and Mental Health, engaging and discussing the reality and challenges in Bahrain with the interconnection of individual, community and planetary wellbeing, and how addressing all levels of wellbeing could galvanize the achievement of the SDGs.-We ask how can wellbeing be at the center of tackling all the SDGs challenges? How can changemakers create effective positive change when they address their mental health? What does community and planetary wellbeing mean, and how can we work towards it?- -The YLP7 is planned and implemented through a close collaboration of the YLP7 National Committee: A team of young representatives from UNDP Bahrain, the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, AlMabarrah AlKhalifia Foundation, Ayadi Relief, Rotaract Club of Bahrain, AIESEC Bahrain, Global Shapers Manama Hub, and YLP alumni.--The YLP7 National Committee has come together this year to look at the theme of “Creating Change from Insight Out,” focusing on Wellbeing and how it relates to Bahrain. Through a collaborative effort, the National Committee has identified the following objectives:- -The YLP7 Experience is a 10-week learning journey that aims to build the inner, interpersonal, and professional capacity of young women and men to create social and environmental impact in their communities and the world. Taking on the theme of “Creating Change from Inside Out,” the YLP7 Experience will give special focus on the wellbeing of the young changemakers, and how addressing their own health can expand and be part of creating solutions for the wellbeing of their communities and the planet.-By joining the programme, participants will:- -After selecting successful applicants to join YLP7 Experience, the main programme will start by 28th of August and will continue until 30th of October. While participants join as individuals, halfway through the programme, participants will form teams that work together in identifying their challenge area and creating an innovative solution that contributes to the achievements of the SDGs.--The programme will consist of a series of interactive and informative virtual workshops that will look like this:-These series of workshops will be supported by various Optional Sessions that will give you an opportunity to further expand your interests, focus on a direction you would like to develop, create a space to get to know other participants, and learn more about the YLP Bahrain and regional community.-By the end of the YLP7 Experience, the teams will then present their ideas to a judging panel at the SDGs Challenge final event. Three winning teams will proceed to the next stage.- -Once the three winning teams are selected, they are further supported to develop their capacity and mature their ideas in the Teams Mentorship stage, This will include:-Every year, the YLP ends with a regional forum where successful youth participants travel to a hosting Arab country. YLP participants get to meet youth from all around the Arab region, share knowledge, learn from each other’s ideas, and network with other young people, regional social innovation experts and policy leaders, and international development organizations. The format and date of the Regional Forum will be defined at a later time, depending on the COVID-19 situation in the region.

As such, UNDP has begun the process to identify what is needed to develop an enabling and supportive environment for financing the BE in the three beneficiary countries of Barbados, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.-Let’s take a look at some of the key gaps and constraints as well as some of the recommendations identified in the various consultations conducted and reported on in Phase 1 of the project.-- -No man is an island-It’s important to accept this old adage that speaks to working together for a greater good. Although each island is unique, it was determined that improved collaboration between sectors, institutions and stakeholders at a regional level is needed to better enable and support regional and national ocean policies. This collaboration is especially important as it relates to targeted data collection and data analysis platforms to aid decision making. The reports produced under the project so far highlighted that there was an urgent need for multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms to help implementation of the BE both within each country, and at a regional level. Additionally, at a local level, an integrated approach that spans across all policy areas that affect the ocean, such as environmental protection, maritime transport, coastal development, fisheries, tourism, energy, defence, maritime safety and security, and energy also needs to be considered under a “whole-of-government” approach to developing Blue Growth in Small Island States or Big Ocean States, as we would like to call them in this context.- -Capacity building and commitment go hand in hand-As the region collaborates to harness the power of the BE and support financing, it is important to boost capacity at a regional and country level. So far it has been a need has to build on existing national governance modalities at both the national and regional levels to support the future of the BE has been identified. This capacity building is even more important due to the post COVID-19 world we are faced with. But importantly, it was identified that in addition to building human capital and policy, commitment to the implementation of international agreements that seek to incorporate a range of economic instruments was critical. This commitment to create and honour these agreements will help mainstream ocean governance and support a BE alongside national sustainable development commitments and those of the climate change agenda.- -The Blue Economy is more than just “the economy”-Words matter and it was identified that promoting the concept of “Blue Growth” as opposed to “Blue Economy” may have value as additional conversations are had about the BE. This is because any BE framework needs to be both socially equitable and sustainable in equal amounts as a focus on only economic benefits may create imbalance. In addition to the general public and stakeholders not having a comprehensive understanding of BE, some “less critical” sectors have legitimate concerns that the current “push” towards focusing on the term “economy” may result in forms of development that marginalise certain users and sectors. However, with careful planning and a focus on equity and social justice as central to all BE related policies, plans and processes this can be avoided.- -Slow and steady wins the BE race-The project has highlighted the importance of a gradual transition to a BE based development stating that sudden and drastic changes in national governance arrangements should be avoided when preparing any new pathway to pursue BE delivery. Instead, the recommendation of a phased approach was put forward to help transition towards new ways of working. Some areas that would benefit from a phased approach include efforts to formalise informal industries e.g. small-scale fisheries, which would in turn spread the benefits of growth across different socioeconomic groups. Careful planning that is not rushed, will ensure that vulnerable populations who engage in informal activities in the BE are not crowded out by the potential introduction of larger private sector firms into some predominantly informal sectors such as fishing and marine tourism. By identifying these groups that may be disadvantaged, governments can promote a more inclusive approach to development.-These are just a few of the key observations revealed  by the project so far. A series of consultations held, delved deeper into the individual country intricacies of Barbados, Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines and provided comprehensive reports to capture the data revealed. As the project continues and work is in progress to action some of these recommendations and reduce the highlighted gaps, UNDP remains committed to supporting the region in financing the Blue.","['Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","In the news,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 14  Life below water,News,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

It is also the first project to be fully developed from the island’s agricultural and fisheries Sectoral Adaptation Strategy . The Strategy is part of Saint Lucia’s overall plan to adapt to climate change through its National Adaptation Plan . This project underscores the shared commitment between Government of Saint Lucia and the EnGenDER Project to ensure gender equality and social inclusion are prioritized in national efforts to improve resilience to natural hazards and climate impacts.-“We made a commitment to focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, and that includes persons with disabilities.  A growing body of evidence shows when women, girls and marginalized groups have a seat at the table, we enhance the impact and reach of our institutions and resources,” said Ashley Crossley, First Secretary, Development, High Commission of Canada to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean.  “We believe this is the most effective approach to building a more peaceful, more prosperous and more inclusive world,” she said.-The UNDP EnGenDER Project is funded by the Governments of Canada and the UK, and has been operating since 2020 to further integrate gender equality and human rights-based approaches into disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and environmental management frameworks in nine  Caribbean countries  – Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname.-“UNDP, through the EnGenDER Project, remains committed to supporting projects that protect society’s most vulnerable, including persons living with disabilities, to and ensuring they have equal access to tools and opportunities that improve their resilience to climate change, enhance their opportunities to earn and provide greater food security,” said Ugo Blanco, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean.-In expressing their gratitude for this commitment, Albertina Mondesir, President of the Farmers with Disabilities Association said the project will provide numerous opportunities for the beneficiaries.-“We will plant it, we will nurture it and we know that it will grow into fine trees that will bear fruits of life, livelihood, resilience and economic benefit,” Ms. Mondesir said.  “And we will use this benefits to help meet our social, medical, educational and other needs, and to ensure that future persons with disabilities know there is something that they can come to,  learn from and build on.-As exogenous threats like COVID-19 continue to impact the region, it is vital that developmental efforts continue to reinforce the need for regional resilience, building forward better build and bolstering livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups.

-During the first phase of CariSECURE, the initiative established a Police Records Management Information System (PRMIS) for police forces in eight Caribbean countries which enabled them to improve crime information gathering and analysis in the region to develop more effective crime prevention strategies. The initiative also bolstered regional capacity by offering training, building a community of practice around the platform, and providing equipment to facilitate the use of the platform and increase the overall infrastructure.-""Over the past several decades, the United Nations has been an integral partner to USAID in the Caribbean. In more recent years, the spirit of partnership has grown significantly stronger, enhancing our development assistance to the region. Over the years, UNDP and USAID have partnered in various development sectors to support the Caribbean SIDS in meeting their sustainable development priorities. We are committed to this partnership to address the SIDS' development challenges and to achieve mutual objectives and goals"", expressed Clinton D. White, USAID Regional Representative for the Eastern and Southern Caribbean.-Crime and violence amongst youth are important obstacles to development in the Caribbean. CariSECURE 2.0 will support the introduction of crime information systems to other key government agencies and provide training and technical support to government officials and key stakeholders to design evidence informed youth programs, policies and strategies.-""Through this valuable partnership, UNDP is supporting governments to improve security and enhance the capacity of the police to prevent violence by using data to inform policies and programs”, said Luis Felipe López Calva, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean.-As exogenous threats like COVID-19 continue to impact the region, it is vital that developmental efforts continue to reinforce the need for regional resilience, building forward better build and bolstering livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups.

On Thursday, April 28 and Friday April 29, the National Office of Disaster Services (NODS) and the Development Control Authority (DCA) in collaboration with  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean conducted a series of training sessions with contractors and homeowners in Barbuda focused on the Antigua and Barbuda Building Code.  The training placed emphasis on structural elements, hurricane preparedness and general construction best practices and was attended by twenty- four persons (Five females and nineteen males). This activity is in line with the EU goal to support Caribbean resilience. -Philmore Mullin, Director of the National Office of Disaster services added that “The direct intervention by the government of Antigua and Barbuda in partnership with UNDP should signal the beginning of low-cost low vulnerability in the housing sector this would result in significant risk reduction across the country. Training and information sharing is key to achieving and maintaining this standard going forward.”-Mr. Edlorn Ray, a contractor speaking in support of the training stated, “The knowledge for proper construction is very important. It improves the quality of the buildings, and it also gives us the resources to build forward better and stronger to withstand disasters.”-During the two-day visit, seven additional families also received the keys to their newly rehabilitated homes under Phase 2 of the Housing Support to Barbuda Project led Government of Antigua and Barbuda and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and through the strategic guidance and financial contribution of the European Union (EU). The 7 homes are part of 84 homes to be provided in the final stage of the €5 million-euro project to repair and rebuild homes that were either destroyed or severely damaged during the passage of Hurricane Irma in September 2017. -Beneficiary, Mohammid Walbrook, noted, ""It feels great to receive the keys and begin to take the next step towards being back in house I can call my own again.""-Valerie Cliff, Resident Representative for UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean explained, “Small Island Developing States, particularly in the Caribbean, are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. Hurricanes are a part of life in the region and due to the changing climate, these occurrences are becoming more violent and unpredictable. Through interventions like this one, we are working with communities to enhance their knowledge and skillset to not only help them to rebuild but to better prepare and in so doing attempt to mitigate the effects of disasters. This training allows us to boost the local capacity of contractors and homeowners by providing them with the knowledge needed to build more resilient housing which will allow climate-resilient building going forward.”-These 7 new homes have been rehabilitated following UNDP's Building Forward Better Principles and takes into consideration the Build Back Better techniques. As exogenous threats like COVID-19 continue to impact the region, it is important that developmental efforts continue to highlight the need for regional resilience and building forward better. As the Caribbean continues to seek solutions to build resilience and livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with governments and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development throughout the region and building resilient communities that can withstand shocks and crises through targeted projects and programmes.-As exogenous threats like COVID-19 continue to impact the region, it is vital that developmental efforts continue to reinforce the need for regional resilience, building forward better build and bolstering livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups.

These activities will all enable women in the Nature Isle to increase their resilience to climate impacts.-Speaking via video message during Wednesday’s launch event, High Commissioner of Canada to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, Her Excellency Lilian Chatterjee said disasters have imposed significant costs on the Dominican economy and the people of Dominica, leading to major declines in economic growth.-“Yes, we must help everyone, but it is very important to be efficient in our preparedness and response,” she said.  “Women are impacted differently, so we must tailor our approach to prepare and respond differently.  [This] project...will further contribute to the pursuit of gender responsiveness, climate change resiliency through data collection, capacity building and the implementation of diverse climate actions based on national adaptive gaps and needs.“-The Government of the UK, through its development programme in the Caribbean has been helping to build climate resilience across the Region for many years. Deputy British High Commissioner to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, His Excellency Craig Fulton, noted that the impact of Hurricane Maria created new and even larger needs which may make the task of supporting Dominica’s goal of becoming the world’s first climate resilient nation seem a challenging objective, but reinforced his government’s commitment to supporting this essential endeavor. -“Today’s activity highlights another major step in the partnership we have with Dominica, recognizing the need for robust data to support the policies that protect the vulnerable to ensure that all persons have the tools needed to face climate change,” he said.-During the launch, it was further highlighted that other EnGenDER projects in Dominica will assist with building resilience among  the island’s indigenous Kalinago communities and persons living with disabilities.-“With the introduction of the new Ministerial portfolio “Seniors Security and Dominicans with Disabilities,” and being given the first opportunity to lead in this portfolio, it has always been my Ministry’s priority to ensure that vulnerable populations, including seniors, persons with disabilities, women, men, youth, boys and girls, among others, have equitable access to project benefits,” Dr. Adis King, Minister of Youth Development and Empowerment, Youth at Risk, Gender Affairs, Seniors Security and Dominicans with Disabilities said while addressing those attending the launch.  “Gender equality also plays an important role in the lives of persons with disabilities and their families,” she added.-The UNDP EnGenDER Project is funded by the Governments of Canada and the UK, and has been operating since 2020 to further integrate gender equality and human rights-based approaches into disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and environmental management frameworks in nine  Caribbean countries – Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname.-Speaking to the project’s reach, Valerie Cliff, Resident Representative UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, stated, “Through the continued support of the Government of Canada and the UK, our EnGenDER Project allows UNDP to expand our work in Dominica and apply a much needed gender lens on activities. This important initiative will further promote gender equality and boost climate resilience for the whole of society.”-In Dominica, the Project partnered with Government during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide 150 unemployed and single-parent-headed households with income support, while developing successful awareness campaigns to prevent gender-based violence.  And in February 2022, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment, Rural Modernization and Kalinago Upliftment, the EnGenDER project supported the development of a comprehensive livelihood assessment for Dominica’s indigenous population, that aimed to address their specific vulnerabilities to climate impacts and find solutions to improve their resilience and enhance their livelihoods.-As exogenous threats like COVID-19 continue to impact the region, it is vital that developmental efforts continue to reinforce the need for regional resilience, building forward better build and bolstering livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups.

The local consultation was part of the global consultation to stimulate an inclusive whole-of-society and whole-of-government dialogue on the main themes of Stockhom+50 and will inform the international meeting entitled “Stockholm+50: a healthy planet for the prosperity of all – our responsibility, our opportunity”, in Stockholm on 2 and 3 June 2022, during the week of World Environment Day.-Illuminating Barbados’ role in these important global dialogue, Ms. Cliff explained, “Barbados is one of only two Caribbean islands that will be participating in this global initiative, therefore, these leadership dialogues that are being convened are not only an opportunity for Barbados but should also be seen as an opportunity to more broadly present an environmentally resilient future in the context of all the Caribbean Small Island Development States.”-Dr. Alloys Kamuragiye, UNICEF Representative Eastern Caribbean, also present during the opening session highlighted the impact of climate change on the youth while reinforcing that young people have an important role to play. He explained, “Children bear the biggest brunt of the impact of climate change and environmental pollution, these impacts threaten to undermine the decades of progress ... But children and youth are not helpless victims but active agents of change who recgonise the effects that climate change will have on their future and take an active stance against the challenge, and on many occasions young people are more successful than adults. Children and young people worldwide have become key advocates for climate action and environmental rights and effectively exercise their right to participate.”-The Hon. Adrian Forde, Minister of Environment and National Beautification encouraged the youth to actively get involved and encouraged that their innovation and creativity could pave the way to a more climate resilient Barbados and world. “I implore the young people in this room to continue your advocacy, be the active participants, the activists, put all your collective sinew to ensuring that your neighbour does the right thing... I will challenge you today to use your creativity... challenge yourself as it relates to the environment,” he stated as he gave a passionate address to those in attendance.-The Stockholm+50 Barbados Youth Meeting aimed to provide a space for the young people of Barbados to be integrated into the Stockholm +50 process.

Through this capacity-building initiative, which will be led by the CTO, tourism stakeholders will be provided with access to convenient, up-to-date and innovative training to support their CBT development efforts, improve their business skills and productivity. The Online Course will be hosted via the recently launched Caribbean Tourism Institute and will include animated lectures, activity worksheets, case studies, videos and knowledge-test assessments that will form part of a user-focussed interactive e-learning package.-“In order to create a more sustainable and inclusive tourism industry, there must be capacity building for both public and private stakeholders within the industry,” Valerie Cliff, Resident Representative UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, noted. “Community-based tourism provides the opportunity for tourists to have authentic experiences while ensuring that MSMEs are also beneficiaries and guardians of well-developed tourism strategies, which embrace the unique cultural heritage of the region. To realise this vision, collaboration with stakeholders such as the CTO, the lead regional organisation on tourism, is critical, if we want to strengthen the capacity of MSMEs throughout the region.”  She added, highlighting the need for greater collaboration with regional tourism stakeholders, as a conduit for regional transformation in the tourism sector.-The collaboration is being delivered in the frame of the UNDP Future Tourism Project, which aims to create socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable value chains. The Future Tourism project was developed out of a need to adapt to the new post-COVID-19 environment and to build resilience within the economic sectors of the region. This collaboration with the CTO is one of many collaborative efforts, which seek to improve the long-term socioeconomic and cultural interests of the region.-CTO’s Acting Secretary-General, Mr Neil Walters, speaking on the collaboration, expressed his appreciation to the UNDP for the support and technical assistance to the CTO and by extension, the regional tourism sector. He added, “the CTO has identified CBT as a regional tourism development strategy. This is further justified by the shift in tourism demand enabling the evolution of niche markets and specially curated tourism products in the areas of rural and indigenous tourism, heritage and wellness tourism. As we herald a new era of Caribbean tourism, industry resilience and recovery should incorporate the introduction of innovative ideas for product diversification and enhancement, and capacity-building for various stakeholders including MSMEs to navigate the new normal and generate more direct benefits from tourism”.-The Online Course will facilitate the delivery of training to the widest possible regional audience and is expected to enhance CBT know-how, improve quality standards in the region, and contribute to the success and viability of MSMEs in host communities. Participants will obtain a Certificate for successful completion of the course, which will add value to regional populations that have scarce opportunities for professional development.-The UNDP Future Tourism project aims to assist governments with identifying and implementing tourism revitalisation strategies, as well as enhancing the resilience of MSMEs to external shocks while advancing their recovery and supporting digital transformation. With UNDP’s partnership with the CTO, phase 2 which aims to provide technical support for MSME retooling and access to markets within the tourism value chain, MSMEs will benefit from the additional support of the self-paced course which will provide an opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills.-As part of its commitment to promote economic diversification, job creation and resilience with the ""Blue Economy for Green Islands"" vision, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean aims to continue to leverage partnerships with key stakeholders in the region. UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with governments and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development throughout the region and the creation of resilient communities which can withstand shocks and crises through targeted projects and programmes. - -***- -About the United Nations Development Programme, Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean-UNDP is the leading United Nations organisation fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality and climate change.

In celebration of International Forests Day on March 21, 2022, students from the Salybia Primary School, Sineku Primary School, Concord Primary School and Atkinson Primary School came out to plant fruit trees on their school compounds. The initiative formed part of activities spearheaded by the Strengthening Sustainable Livelihoods and Resilience in the Kalinago Territory (SSLR) Project being implemented by the United Nations Development Programme in collaboration with the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica through the Forestry Wildlife and Parks Division with support from the India-UN Fund and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation.-""We love fruits!"" chimed students of Salybia Primary School as they admired their handiwork. They planted several fruit trees around their school which included sapodilla, mango, guava, cherry, pommecythere, pommerac and avocado.  The young students ages ranging from 5 to 11 are excited to take care of their newly planted trees and cannot wait to taste the fruits!
-Senior Teacher at the Sineku Primary School Willa Cyrille said that the tree planting drive signifies a huge step in raising the awareness of the importance of our forests and will also teach the students the significance of proper nutrition. “We know that the objective is to reforest the Kalinago Territory at some point, however the planting of the fruit trees here today is very significant in that we are not only speaking to reforestation, but we are also speaking to nutrition and food security at the school. We know that eventually these trees are going to bear fruits that the children can enjoy and will bring back some natural foods into their diet that are lacking in some cases. We are very happy and honored to be a part of this whole process”, Cyrille noted.-Students were assisted by teachers, forestry officers and UNDP representatives who donated the trees under the SSLR Project. Project Coordinator Nickez McPherson said that the team was elated to be a part of this important venture which supports the United Nations General Assembly’s goal in raising awareness on the importance of the forest. “One of the goals of this intervention is the successful implementation of a reforestation programme to augment livelihoods and protect the environment. It is therefore fitting that the project team felt it important to incorporate the students of the 4-H Clubs of the primary schools in the Kalinago Territory in planting trees on International Day of Forests. This awareness activity also forms part of the sustainability plan of the project to encourage students to become custodians of the environment”, McPherson said.-Forests are vital for sustainable food production and forest ecosystem services such as the maintenance of biodiversity, climate regulation, water and soil quality, and pollination are essential for sustainable agri-food systems and feeding a growing global population. In addition, more than three-quarters of rural households worldwide are estimated to harvest wild foods from forests and other environments.  Kalinago Chief Lorenzo Sanford expressed his gratitude to the UNDP Team; an initiative he thinks will definitely benefit the students and the Kalinago people in the future. He said that the trees are very native to the Kalinago space. 
-Minister of the Environment, Rural Modernisation and Kalinago Upliftment, Honorable Cozier Frederick said the day’s observance marked the invaluable importance of our forests and this collaboration with UNDP and the SSLR Project reminds us that our youth can play a vital role in protecting our forests. He said Dominica’s ecosystem remains resilient and relevant, even after massive destruction by natural disasters. “Dominica can boast of sixty percent vegetative cover and perhaps the greatest percentage of protective areas in our hemisphere totaling over twenty-one percent. We have a forest ecosystem which has proven to be relevant and resilient. This was evident after the ravages caused by Hurricane David in 1979 and most recent Tropical Storm Erica in 2015 and Hurricane Maria in 2017. On all occasions the forest reemerged in rather quick time”, Honorable Frederick said.-With the support of the Division of Forestry, Wildlife and Parks, several key initiatives have also been implemented as part of the reforestation activities. Namely, community sensitization meetings that underscore the importance of planting trees which provide environmental protection, increase water levels of identified water sources and create a buffer between agricultural lands and these water sources. Further, over fifty (50) individuals from the Kalinago Territory have been engaged under a ‘cash for trees programme to provide support for the planting of trees. These activities commenced in October 2021 will continue until the end of the intervention in June 2022. 
-Sustainable management and use of forests and their resources are key to combating climate change and contributing to the prosperity and well-being of current and future generations. Forests also play a crucial role in poverty alleviation and in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This year, International Forest Day was observed under the theme: ‘Forests and sustainable production and consumption’.-At this time when exogenous threats like COVID-19 are impacting the region, it is vital that developmental efforts are continued to reinforce the need for regional resilience and building forward better. This intervention is part of the work of UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean in its commitment to promoting economic diversification, job creation and resilience with the ""Blue Economy for Green Islands"" vision. As the Caribbean continues to seek solutions to build resilience and livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with governments and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development throughout the region and building resilient communities that can withstand shocks and crises through targeted projects and programmes. - - -For media queries please contact Communications Officer Zaimis Olmos zaimis.olmos@undp.org-***-UNDP is the leading United Nations organisation fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality and climate change.

But that corridor has dwindled to just 50% of its historic range. Ironically, one of the many symbolisms attributed to jaguars is protection, but today the fate of jaguars lies in humans being able to protect the habitat it roams in.-In 2018, a high-level forum brought together representatives from 14 jaguar range countries along with practitioners to kickoff region-wide cooperation for jaguar conservation. This led to the 2030 New York Statement. Following this, a Jaguar 2030 Conservation Roadmap for the Americas united various stakeholders around a shared vision to conserve jaguars. This strong regional coordination was reemphasized at the first high-level conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade in the Americas, held in Peru.-Regional collaboration is strengthened by the commitment to conservation at the national and local levels. In 2020, three jaguar-range countries — Belize, Ecuador, and Panama — joined the Global Wildlife Program (GWP), funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).-GWP projects look at jaguar conservation holistically addressing multiple threats to jaguars such as habitat loss and fragmentation, human-jaguar conflict, and the trafficking of jaguar parts.

VIRTUAL REMARKS-Luis Felipe Lopez-Calva-UN ASG and UNDP Director for Latin America and the Caribbean-Belize Investment Summit- 10 November 2021-Greetings:-His Excellency, John Briceno, Prime Minister of Belize-His Excellency, Steven Harper, Former Prime Minister, Canada-Honourable Christopher Coye, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance-Other Cabinet Ministers-Distinguished members of Government, the Diplomatic Corps, Private Sector, UN Colleagues, Members of the Media-Ladies and Gentlemen-Good morning. I am delighted to participate in Belize’s Investment Summit 2021 and contribute to the discussion on the country’s sustainable economic recovery.-Belize is endowed with extensive cultural and natural diversity with the world’s second longest barrier reef and the cultural melting pot of its population, which have together underpinned and shaped its socioeconomic development.-Belize shares a common narrative with many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) based on the significant and rapid economic downturn triggered by COVID-19. The rising human toll within our nations is a continuous reminder that 20 months after the declaration of a global pandemic, we are still experiencing its impacts and uncertainties and many countries have yet to realize expectations for the predicted “vaccine-powered” recovery.-The IMF reported that economies within the LAC region contracted by 7.4% in 2020; and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated an 8.1% contraction within the tourism-driven Caribbean states with over 14% in Belize. The multiplicity and complexity of threats being faced by Belize is a stark reminder that COVID-19 found our countries with multi-dimensional “pre-existing” conditions, including low economic growth, high inequality, biodiversity loss and increasing impacts of climate change.-While the multiple crises being faced by LAC countries have worsened by COVID-19, the pandemic offers the opportunity for new and innovative thinking underpinned by strategic partnerships to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enhance the quality of people’s lives. For a country like Belize whose economy is already challenged by limited fiscal space and high debt and that is rooted in its natural assets, the pandemic provides a turning point to change the paradigm to more sustainable and diversified industries, maximizing the blue, green, and orange economies. This necessitates tailored investments in areas and sectors that will have catalytic and multiplier effects and stimulate inclusive green recovery.-In this regard, I congratulate the Government and people of Belize on the recent accomplishment in refinancing a part of the nation’s public debt by leveraging its natural capital. The Belizean “Blue Bond” is reflective of the innovation needed in “rebalancing of nature, climate and the economy”.-Like many countries in LAC, sustainable recovery must include gradual debt reduction, growth stimulation, building resilience and reducing inequalities. Major pillars of the recovery should also include the resuscitation of employment and productivity, upskilling, enhancing fiscal space and securing adequate access to international liquidity, the restarting of education systems, improving access to services through digitalization and e-governance, diversified and sustainable models of tourism, and enabling the country to deliver adequate vaccinations. Belize’s economic recovery policies should translate into practical programmes that are locally oriented and reflective of the country’s natural assets and endogenous attributes.-A key question for many governments is: How to best identify and support industries that will drive economic recovery while preventing human development regression?  I am happy to inform that at the core of UNDP’s work is connecting countries to global knowledge networks to share ideas, experiences, know-how, tools, and best practices to advance their national development priorities and achieve the SDGs. One such tool that is proving quite effective in helping countries to identify and target investments toward achieving the SDGs is UNDP’s SDGs Investor Map, piloted in Brazil. These investor maps provide localized insight into sectors and market conditions that contribute to countries advancing prioritized targets of the SDGs.-The methodology identifies Investment Opportunity Areas (IOAs) and business models that are backed by actionable data to guide investor decision-making. UNDP has collaborated with the Government of Belize to apply the SDG Investor Mapping methodology which has produced results situating an initial 16 investment opportunities across seven (7) sectors including education, renewable energy, agriculture, and transportation. If acted upon, these solutions could boost building forward better and galvanizing multi-partnership support to achieve the SDGs. A key benefit of this exercise is tied to its adaptability and the potential usefulness in continuously informing targeted investments aligned to development priorities.-I acknowledge the contribution of the United Nations Resident Coordination Office and other partners for this initiative. Given the collaborative interest shown by the Government of Belize, and in particular, the leadership of the Honourable Christopher Coye, I know the results of the Investor Mapping will not be confined to paper but will be actively translated into practical solutions through diverse partnerships to enhance the quality of life for all Belizeans, ensuring that “no one is left behind”. The time is now, the opportunities abound. Will the country move forward with a new paradigm, or will it be business as usual?-Ladies and Gentlemen.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded this project through its the “Evidence-Based Information Management for Citizen Security in Central America and the Dominican Republic” program; UNDP Belize procured the equipment. This collaborative effort, also known as the InfoSegura Project, is an integral part of broader U.S. efforts to support improvements in citizen security in the region.-
The donation includes a high-powered Hewlett-Packard (HP) server, three HP workstations with high-quality monitors, and three rugged tablets. This equipment will strengthen the sharing of inter-agency crime data and other relevant information among key agencies in Belize.-
The recipients of today’s donation are the Belize Police Department, the National Forensic Science, and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. These are among the agencies that contribute data and information to the Belize Crime Observatory (BCO), which is the national repository of crime data and information.-Through this donation, the United States Government has responded to the urgent needs outlined in the BCO’s Strategic Action Plan (2020-2023), which advances collaborative efforts to develop Belize’s multi-agency Crime Intelligence Architecture, enhancing both national and regional security.-“We are proud to partner with regional agencies and stand with Belize to improve its comprehensive framework for information sharing. Being able to access crime data easily and quickly will help authorities to better detect, prevent, and prosecute criminal offenses. This multi-agency approach is critical to reducing crime and promoting national security, which in turns makes the region safer,” INL Coordinator Mary Walz highlighted.-“In our rapidly evolving world, Information and Communications Technology is king! We are very pleased that the Ministry of Home Affairs & New Growth Industries’ focus on strategic crime interventions through innovation and technology is receiving a much-needed boost through the USAID-funded InfoSegura project. This donation of ICT equipment will go a long way to realizing our vision for the development of a state-of the-art, Crime Intelligence Architecture for Belize,” noted Minister of Home Affairs Kareem Musa.-In April 2021, InfoSegura also donated US$15,205 worth of ICT equipment to the ministry, including a high-powered Dell server and three Dell workstations.-UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Ian King remarked, “UNDP applauds the continued commitment of the Ministry of Home Affairs to addressing citizen security with the support of the United States Agency for International Development. InfoSegura is already assisting in the provision of data and information as well as tools to enhance policies, strategies, and plans of the Government of Belize to improving safety and security in Belize, but we do have much more to do and UNDP is committed to partnering with the government and stakeholders to realise these goals.”-The InfoSegura project supports interventions and policies that aim to strengthen crime and justice data platforms both nationally and regionally, including working to support the formulation of evidenced-based policies and decisions. The project is being implemented in Belize by the UNDP and implementing partner the Ministry of Home Affairs & New Growth Industries.

This partnership set in motion the Infosegura Regional Project in 2014, mobilizing $21 million for national and regional public institutions responsible for information management in the area of citizen security.-This new stage involves the deployment of $10 million to the countries in the region to continue to demonstrate results and sustain the progress that countries have achieved in institutionalizing the use of evidence in public policymaking on the matter of people-centered citizen security with a focus on prevention.-The new $10 million investment will strengthen and help ensure sustainability for progress the countries have achieved in institutionalizing the use of evidence in policymaking and following up on public policies for citizen security. ""We work in close collaboration with the UNDP on the programme called Infosegura, and it is a really important tool to help certain governments compile data on crime and violence, and governments and civil society in those countries are using the data to inform public policy,"" stated Peter Natiello, USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator, Latin America and the Caribbean Bureau.-InfoSegura is the first USAID and UNDP regional strategic partnership in the matter of citizen security, enhancing work the UNDP does with strategic partner institutions in the sector, and a robust model for regional integration, spotlighting the inclusion of voices from civil society and academia by consolidating the CONOSE network. This new phase will see InfoSegura continuing to enhance the knowledge, capacities, and lessons learned in the institutions that specialize in citizen security and justice.-This coordinated work involves 42 public institutions, 27 civil society organizations, and 11 academic institutions, supporting capacity-building for over 400 public officials, seven digital multidimensional information management systems, over 10 specialized regional studies, and 62 national reports.-InfoSegura contributes to the creation of evidence to reconsider and redefine the rules of the game, reimagining institutions from the perspective of inclusion, transparent management, and high-quality, people-centered public services. Therefore, citizen security is a prerequisite to achieve the sustainable development and human rights agenda, the key to strengthening the ecosystem for the Rule of Law, and eradicating the use of violence as a mechanism for negotiation between political and social actors, and an inclusive justice system.-""InfoSegura is a fundamental stakeholder in strengthening different governments' capacity for the production, use, and dissemination of information for public policies. In this context, cooperation with USAID continues to be fundamental to be able to contribute to increasing citizen trust and engagement in social transformation,"" stated Luis Felipe López Calva, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of the Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean.-Between May 2014 and May 2021, the UNDP had ongoing work through InfoSegura in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic with the motto: “Going from telling to understanding, and understanding for transformation.” This vision has helped drive the shift from quantifying and standardizing data on the incidence of crime to more strategic information management, focusing on the multidimensional analysis of populations and territories most impacted by different forms of violence and insecurity, the production of knowledge, innovation, and new technologies, using evidence to strengthen public policies on citizen security, with an emphasis on the prevention of violence and access to justice, the promotion of social cohesion, with a focus on gender and human rights.-In addition to knowledge products and informing public policy, the work has developed tools to monitor the 2030 Agenda, specifically Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and strong institutions; and SDG 5: Gender equality, and to develop targets for eradicating crime and violence affecting men and women. Furthermore, reliable data is showing that between 2015 and 2020, in the sub-region of Central America and the Dominican Republic the joint total of violent deaths declined by 51%, (48.5% female victims and 51.5% male victims). In 2015, the rate in the region was 45.7 per 100,000 and in 2020 it reached 18.5 per 100,000 people, closing in on the rate for Latin America.-The key has been institutionalizing the processes and aligning them with national security strategies, making it possible for the processes to be sustainable even with elections campaigns and turnover in administrations, this has even been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.-In this sense, Infosegura will make effective contributions to the UNDP response for recovery from the COVID-19 Crisis: Updated multidimensional analysis enabling sharp, swift, and sustained territorialized and targeted responses to health crises, natural disasters, surges in violence, and other obstacles to the progress of sustainable development. Therefore, InfoSegura contributes in a cross-cutting way to the 2030 Agenda, ensuring no one is left behind. Project resources go towards greater and enhanced data disaggregation, multidimensional analysis, updating risk maps that are created with interinstitutional information, and are useful in prioritising and targeting investments and actions in cases where resources are limited.-InfoSegura is also an active community of practice, enhancing South-South exchange of knowledge and experiences in implementation, as well as an ongoing exploration of innovation and use of technology to transform data into actions and responses to different needs in citizen security, justice, and cohesion in the different settings where it operates. Be a part of this far-reaching conversation on the Project website where there are details of the main developments, as well as specialized knowledge products, webinars, tools, and multidimensional reports with updated and validated data.-This partnership renewal reinforces the UNDP and the Project in their commitment to transforming the lives and institutions along the path of sustainable development.-Media Contacts:-UNDP:-Ana Maria Currea, Head of Communications, UNDP in Latin America and the Caribbean, ana.maria.currea@undp.org-Vanessa Hidalgo, Regional Communications Advisor, UNDP in Latin America and the Caribbean, Vanessa.hidalgo@undp.org

The donation was motivated by the recommendations of the pilot study done to determine levels of pollutants in the effluent discharged from selected industries around Gaborone. The pilot study has identified gaps in the monitoring and enforcement of the trade effluent agreement which therefore, necessitated UNDP to support the WUC with equipment that would enable the testing of Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG) from wastewater samples.-When speaking at the occasion, the Chief Executive Officer –Water Utilities Corporation, Mr Gaselemogwe Senai remarked that, “With the growth of food outlets, there is growing production of fat, oil and grease (FOG)”. He added that it is important for WU Corporation to know how much  FOG are going into WUC treatment facilities.. Senai said it is also worth noting that the treatment of wastewater is a biological process which functions effectively in the presence of oxygen.-WUC has developed the Trade Effluent Agreement (TEA) to ensure that the wastewater discharged into the environment and into the WUC sewer system is at an allowable level of pollution. The TEA is meant to reinforce the commitment of industries to undertake pre-treating of wastewater according to the standard of BOS93.-When presenting the laboratory testing equipment UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Balasz Horvath explained that the equipment will expand Mmamashia laboratory testing abilities. He said he is confident that, this addition to the Mmamashia lab will make work easier and testing much better going forward. He also explained that the UNDP supported the Water Utilities Corporation in the past 4 years through the GEF/UNDP funded Biogas Project. UNDP’s  support to Water Utilities Corporation has also focused on harmonization of the WUC trade effluent agreement with the Council by-laws to enable better enforcement of the Trade Effluent Agreement and Capacity development of WUC personnel in the efficient and effective treatment, storage and disposal of sludge waste as well as training in wastewater pre-treatment methods.-UNDP through the Biogas Project has also supported the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resource Conservation and Tourism (MENT) to develop the Integrated Waste Management Bill which aims to facilitate the implementation of the Integrated Waste Management Policy. The bill will provide strategic direction and guidance towards sustainable waste management practices and will adopt an integrated approach for the sound management of all forms of waste media covering solid waste, wastewater and air quality.-Balasz explained that, “Approval of this bill will further support the mandate   of WUC  in managing wastewater and its effects on the environment”. As Botswana transitions to a circular economy, waste being an integral part of this process, Balasz encouraged WUC to play a key role in the process and support the reuse and recycling of wastewater to achieve sustainable development goal targets.-He added that, “Together we can contribute and achieve set targets for SDG 6 which highlights that we ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and SDG 12 which encourages us to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Saving our natural resources, in this case water, will require a collective effort by all stakeholders”.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Global Environmental Finance,Chemicals and waste management,Botswana ,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,News,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,English,Renewable energy"

The agreement is aimed at solidifying a solemn commitment toward supporting the sustainability and growth of SMEs in Botswana. The partnership was signed into action at an event, which took place on Monday 15th July 2021 in Gaborone.-UNDP has in recent years made a concerted effort to expand the scope of its contribution in Botswana into the private sector. The Supplier Development Programme (SDP) involves large regional and local firms (Buyers) with local small to medium businesses (Suppliers) and UNDP trained consultants. The aim of the partnership is to encourage the Buyers who are currently importing products to supply the Botswana market to buy from local suppliers. This creates jobs and diversifies the economy, while reducing poverty and inequality.-The commitment towards supporting the growth of SMEs is of high priority at FNBB, particularly due to the impact on small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This support will allow small and medium businesses improved access to competitive finance credit facilities, banking facilities as well as investment facilities. This will allow for greater opportunities that SMEs to ensure that they maintain a steady level of growth and longevity over the years.-“We are excited to enter into this agreement with UNDP.  As FNBB we remain deeply invested in partnerships and collaborations which create lasting socio-economic impact. We therefore take pride in partnering with UNDP in this regard as we join hands towards building a vibrant and resilient SME sector in Botswana. We sign this agreement at the opportune time when the citizen inclusion bill has been signed off by parliament. We therefore remain optimistic that this MoU will facilitate the much-needed access to finance and capacity building for local SME as they start, grow and scale up their businesses”, stated FNBB CEO, Steven Lefentse Bogatsu.-The SDP is in its 2nd year of implementation and ‘access to finance’ is one of the key challenges which have been identified, as common for most SMEs on the programme. UNDP recognizes the difficulties faced by small businesses in their attempts to apply for various credit facilities through traditional banking means. The UNDP Resident Representative a.i, Ms. Margun Indreboe Alshaikh said, “Through the Supplier Development Programme, UNDP is committed to unlocking opportunities for SMEs in Botswana (and beyond) through; access to knowledge, access to markets and access to finance. It is with this view in mind that we are pleased to have partnered with FNB, for provision of holistic financing packages, tailored towards the needs of SMEs”.-FNBB and UNDP look forward to seeing SMEs gain the access and ability to compete in local and international markets, further promoting growth of our local economy and contributing to job creation in Botswana.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 17']","financial institutions,Development Finance,News,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The partnerships were signed into action at the UNDP & Banks Partnerships - Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Signing Ceremony event, which took place on Tuesday 13th July 2021 in Gaborone.-MOU’s were signed between UNDP and six financial institutions which include: Stanbic Bank, ABSA Botswana, Bank Gaborone, Standard Chartered Bank, Citizen Entrepreneurial Development Agency (CEDA) and the National Development Bank (NDB). The ceremony was attended by senior management representatives from each bank and other UNDP-SDP partners, including:-•      Ms. Jacinta Barrins, Resident Representative – UNDP Botswana-•      Mr. Oabile Mabusa, Chief Executive Officer – Bankers Association of Botswana-•      Mr. Charles Siwawa,  Chief Executive Officer – Botswana Chamber of Mines-•      Mr. Samuel Minta, Chief Executive Officer – Stanbic Botswana-•      Mr. Sybrand Coetzee, Managing Director – Bank Gaborone-•      Mr. Mpho Masupe, Chief Executive Officer – Standard Chartered Bank-•      Mr. Thabo Thamane, Chief Executive Officer – CEDA-•      Ms. Lorato Morapedi, Chief Executive Officer – National Development Bank-•      Mr. Keletso Setimela, Head of Business Banking – ABSA Bank Botswana-•      Ms. Masedi Letsididi, Country Coordinator for Botswana – FinMark Trust-The UNDP-SDP works to create demand-based, market-driven opportunities for SMEs to increase their competitiveness through the innovative Suppliers Development Methodology (SDM), while connecting essential small-scale producers/suppliers to larger markets locally as well as abroad.-The programme is in its second year of implementation and ‘access to finance’ is one of the key business challenges listed by SMEs on the programme thus far. Lack of collateral or security, poor business plans, low financial literacy and the lack of financial records are some of the key factors which hinder an SMEs ability to raise capital. UNDP recognizes the difficulties faced by small businesses in their attempts to apply for loans, lines of credit and expansion capital through traditional banking. As such, the UNDP-SDP approached the commercial banks and national financial institutions to provide access to holistic finance packages, tailored towards the needs of SMEs, that will provide investment and credit facilities to at discounted rates.-In her welcome remarks, the UNDP Resident Representative, Ms. Jacinta Barrins presented that the partnerships with the banks were a pivotal piece to the puzzle UNDP was looking to solve in its efforts to support SMEs in Botswana. The UNDP-SDP, she noted, works to provide SMEs with access to markets, access to knowledge and access to finance - which will be advanced through the just signed MOU’s.-Project Manager for the UNDP-SDP, Ms. Boitumelo Mbaakanyi lauded the banks for supporting the UNDP’s efforts to grow the SME economy in Botswana. She  highlighted that the Banks were bringing much to the table in the form of: preferential lending rates; innovative funding mechanisms; projections-based cashflow funding vs. historical financials; SME-friendly credit facilities; credit guarantees. Finally she encouraged the banks to “develop robust relationships with their clients even the ones who deposit fifty Pula (BWP 50) today”.-The event further served to launch a new partnership between UNDP-SDP and FinMark Trust, an organization that seeks to further financial and economic inclusion for the all of the SADC region. The Country Coordinator for FinMark Trust in Botswana, Ms. Masedi Letsididi presented that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are essential for economic development and are expected to be key drivers of sustainable growth in Africa. As such, FinMark Trust has done significant work on MSME scoping in Botswana, Eswatini and Lesotho in an effort to get to understand their form and character. This she said will produce data that will be critical in designing the suitable form of funding for MSMEs.-The UNDP-SDP provides training and support that cultivates growth within SMEs to a level where they can be considered bankable, meeting the requirements of commercial banks and national financial institutions. The partnerships with financial institutions will go further to guarantee that the Suppliers will always have an audience with the banks and financial institutions, as the limiting barriers to entry are lifted. The partnerships will extend beyond the provision of loans and credit, as the financial institutions have also extended the additional offerings of savings accounts, SME employee accounts, financial literacy trainings/workshops, as well as bank-led mentorship and business development programmes to the SDP Suppliers, providing for a holistic package for the SMEs.-The advancement of partnerships which focus on access to finance will support the Supplier SMEs to grow and expand their businesses, building their resilience and in turn, increasing their ability to create jobs and contribute to Botswana’s economic development.-About the UNDP-SDP:-The UNDP-SDP brings together 3 partners a tripartite partnership (Buyers, Suppliers and Consultants) which is unique in Botswana. The partnership involves large regional and local firms (Buyers) with local small to medium businesses (Suppliers) and UNDP trained consultants.  The aim of the partnership is to encourage the Buyers who are currently importing products to supply the Botswana market to buy from local suppliers. UNDP has trained local consultants in a specific designed SDP course about running small to medium businesses that has been rolled out in many countries in South America and Asia. These consultants work with the Suppliers and mentor them for a period of 10 to 12 months to assist them to meet the standards required by the Buyers for local and regional markets.-The SDP programme is focused on the following sectors: Mining, Agro-Processing, Projects (Infrastructure), Leather, Textiles, Health, Digital and Other manufacturing. This creates jobs and diversifies the economy, while reducing poverty and inequality.-For more information and media interviews, contact:-Lebogang Tlhaloso, UNDP Communications Associate - Tel: +267 363 3745; | Mobile: +267 71 686 682; Email: lebogang.tlhaloso@undp.org-Bame Modungwa, Project Officer – SDP - Tel: +267 363 3700; | Mobile: +267 74793355; | Email: Bame.Modungwa@undp.org.",['Icon of SDG 08'],"business partners,Africa,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Botswana ,partnerships,Press release,English,Partnerships"

In order to ensure that the Protocol is participatory and responsive to the needs of African women, UNDP has partnered with the AfCFTA Secretariat to host consultations across the continent, providing a platform for women to voice their needs and interests with regards to trade in the context of the AfCFTA. Through dialogue with women and other key stakeholders, the consultations seek to identify existing and potential challenges and opportunities that women face as they engage in intra-African trade.-In her welcome remarks, Resident Representative of UNDP in Botswana, Ms. Jacinta Barrins shared that Botswana is one of a select few countries in Africa requested to host such an event, a feat which she said was acknowledgement of the good work being done by women in Botswana. She further recognised the the participation of the Ministers from the two lead ministries – the Ministry of Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs and the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry, which signaled the Government’s commitment to the advancement of women’s economic empowerment in Botswana. Ms. Barrins detailed the focus sectors for the consultations which are demonstrative of the vast opportunities available for Batswana businesswomen; Manufacturing, Agri Business, ICT, Creative Arts, Professional Services, Trade Facilitation, and the Informal Sector.-The event was officially opened by the Minister of Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs, Honourable Anna Mokgethi, and the Assistant Minister for Investment, Trade and Industry, Honourable Molebatsi Molebatsi.-In her remarks, Honourable Minister, Anna Mokgethi, emphasized the importance of the informal sector, which comprises of mostly women, for Botswana’s economic growth and development. She urged the organizers to be deliberate in ensuring that the Protocol on Women in Trade would include women in the informal sector.-The Assistant Minister committed to facilitate strengthening of women’s participation in the continental economy by ensuring there is greater public procurement earmarked for women-owned businesses and further committed to ensuring that there is sufficient support given to women-owned SMMEs and cooperatives in both local and regional economies. He encouraged the women in business to produce good quality goods and services to sell into the African market, whilst African governments would do their part to remove the existing challenges and barriers to trade within the continent.-The event also benefitted from a presentation by Mr. Phazha Butale, the Chief Negotiator for Botswana at the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry, who provided an update on the progress of implementation of the AfCFTA agreement as well as the advantages of the agreement for Botswana. He indicated that 54 out of 55 of the African Union member states, including Botswana, have signed the agreement. The AfCFTA is set to bring together a market of 1.2 billion people with a combined GDP of 3.4 trillion US dollars. This, Mr. Butale said, will provide a potential market for Botswana to grow an export-led economy in line with the vision through attraction of Foreign Direct Investment and local investment into creating sustainable and vibrant industries in the country.-The event which was held as a hybrid workshop drew in over 120 participants from the public and private sector. Represented in the room were women from Women in Business Association (WIBA), Business Botswana, Botswana Women in Construction (BOWICO) and various women entrepreneurs. The consultations are an important element in ensuring that the process of developing the AfCFTA Women in Trade Protocol is participatory, inclusive, and responsive to the needs and priorities of women in Botswana and Africa as a whole. The event will be followed up with a validation workshop to ensure that the women’s voices have been well represented in the final report following which a Regional Women in Trade Conference will be held in Accra, Ghana, in July 2021.-For more information and media interviews, contact:-Lebogang Tlhaloso, UNDP Communications Associate - Tel: +267 363 3745; | Mobile: +267 71 686 682; Email: lebogang.tlhaloso@undp.org-Bame Modungwa, Project Officer – SDP - Tel: +267 363 3700; | Mobile: +267 74 793 355; | Email: Bame.Modungwa@undp.org.  -_____________________________________-ABOUT UNDP: UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

The presentation and discussion of the results of the profiling exercise will inform the the completion of the profiling report, which will be the first of its kind in Botswana. The key stakeholders were drawn from government, private sector, non-governmental and civil society organisations.-In his welcome remarks and stating of the objectives of the meetings, the National Coordinator of the Poverty Eradication Programme Mr. Montshiwa Montshiwa said that the profiling of poverty in the Okavango sub-district is the first in a series of districts and sub-districts to be covered in the months to come. He commended the participants for their contributions to the profiling exercise, which he said went smoothly despite the challenges of the tough terrain of the sub-district and limited resources. He said that as the first sub-district to be profiled, their lessons will be used in other districts as the profiling exercise is rolled out countrywide. Okavango was chosen as the first sub-district in the exercise due to the high levels of poverty and need for urgent and comprehensive attention as noted by His Excellency the President of Botswana.--The profiling of the Okavango sub-district and the ones that will follow adopted the multi-dimensional approach to measuring poverty as opposed to the monetary based approach that is commonly used in national statistics. This is borne out of Botswana’s recent decision to adopt a multi-dimensional approach to poverty. The multidimensional poverty index (MPI) is an international measure of acute multidimensional poverty covering over 100 countries across the globe, capturing not only monetary poverty measures, but deprivations in health, education and living standards that a person faces simultaneously.  Since 2019, UNDP Botswana has collaborated with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) to provide technical support throughout the steps to ensure the effective realisation of the adoption of the global multidimensional approach to poverty. In 2020, Botswana was included in the global MPI measure for the first time.-Alongside the global measure, Botswana has developed a national Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which is the basis on which the profiling of poverty was done. The policy shift from the monetary based approach to poverty was borne out of the desire to be comprehensive and targeted as well as leave no one behind in addressing poverty in all its dimensions and manifestations. The MPI provides the means to understand poverty in all the dimensions that define one’s life, enabling policy makers to allocate resources and design policies and programmes more effectively.-The key findings from the profiling exercise show that the Okavango sub-district is disproportionately poverty-stricken, with monetary poverty level of 37.7% and multidimensional poverty level of 34.6% against the national levels of 16.3% and 17.2% respectively. At 68%, the sub-district has a significantly high number of households that are headed by females. The unemployment level is also very high, with 8,142 households heads unemployed out of a total of 10,373 captured in the sub-district’s data system. Further, the level of education attainment is extremely low with only 10.5% of the households heads having attained at least a General Certificate of Secondary Education (BGCSE). Access to sanitation services and the level of use of electricity were also very low, with 66% of the households having no toilet facilities and only 27% of the households using electricity as a source of lighting. On average, the households own very few assets, hence, coupled with the high level of unemployment, the sub-district’s sources of livelihood are highly limited. For instance, the average number of domestic animals owned by households are 8 for cattle and goats, 4 for donkeys and pigs, 10 for chickens and 2 for horses.  These figures of ownership of domestic animals are far below the thresholds for a household to be considered not poor.-The profiling has identified prominent types of poverty in the sub-district, being, societal, income, shelter and sanitation, and food poverty. The key poverty drivers have been found to be lack of employment opportunities; non-availability of basic infrastructure and limited market access which make it challenging for households to pursue profitable economic activities; uncoordinated policies and programmes and their ineffective targeting; as well as human/wildlife conflicts given that the sub-district is in the geographical area where there are large numbers of wildlife species. These very specific findings provide the opportunity to formulate relevant policy responses to address poverty in the sub-district, which underscores the usefulness of the multidimensional approach to measuring and understanding poverty.-Beyond the profiling exercise, the profiling report recommends targeted and sustainable policy and programme interventions to address the factors that drive poverty in the sub-district. For example, the report recommends policy interventions that, alongside the improvement of the physical infrastructure should be geared towards improving the level of education, which in the medium to long term should be expected to improve the level of uptake of profitable economic opportunities, including the poverty eradication and economic empowerment programmes and projects that are rolled out by different government departments. The recommendation to improve the employment opportunities proposes the optimisation of sustainable natural resource management that are in the sub-district such as tourism-oriented income generating activities and the development of the value chains within the tourism and natural resource sectors.-Indeed, the meetings provided a great opportunity to bring together the key stakeholders to discuss the poverty issues in the sub-district. The stakeholders reflected on the necessity to adopt coordinated approaches and partnerships in policy formulation and implementation of interventions to address poverty. The government departments and community leadership highlighted the need to work closely together in policy and programme formulation and implementation to ensure optimal use of the scarce public resources that are at their exposal.-The private sector, NGOs and CBOs representing different sectors ranging from women and youth empowerment, education, natural resources conservation, and fight against gender-based violence, among others. They were very appreciative of the poverty profiling report and its recommendations. They expressed that the findings of the report will assist them tremendously in the development of their strategies and programmes to effectively support the communities to address poverty. There was particular emphasis on the importance of partnerships between these entities and the government and the communities to enable targeted and effective response to poverty in the sub-district.-Overall, the profiling report and its presentation brought about useful lessons about the implementation of the national MPI. These lessons will be of great value as the government embarks on rolling out the other pilot profiling exercises in other districts and sub-districts. For UNDP, the experiences and lessons are extremely informative to the design of programmes in other areas of the country across an array of issues, including for environment and climate change and women and youth empowerment. As UNDP continues its support to the government in the roll-out of the national MPI, it will important to bring the lessons learned from Botswana to the  global Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN) to continuously improve the approach and ways in which governments can bring these statistics to life as they work to improve the lives of their citizens.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 11']","Goal 1  No poverty,Poverty reduction and inequality,Botswana ,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities"

The awards ceremony was part of Anti-GBV project between the two organisations. Men and Boys for Gender Equality (MBGE) is a Botswana based Non Government Organisation (NGO) that engages men and boys to reduce gender inequalities, GBV, prevent HIV and promote health & well being of Women, Men and Children.-Speaking at the ceremony the UNDP Acting Resident Representative, Ms. Margunn Indreboe Alshaikh said that the project started by selecting several people to serve as ambassadors in the conversation about GBV prevention and response in November 2020. These ambassadors, she says, “were identified through Facebook following, positive social media content, and those with platforms to engage with young people.” She further explained that the selected ambassadors were oriented to develop key messaging on GBV, youth empowerment and COVID-19 to be shared on their respective platforms to advance the initiative through media.-“The inaugural anti- GBV Activism Awards given to recipients were a means to encourage members of the community, particularly men and boys, to educate their communities about ending GBV and promoting healthy lifestyles for all members of their communities—women, men and children”, Margunn-She added that the awards were therefore conceptualised to mobilise communities to actively engage in ending GBV through a competition that ran during the annual 16 Days of Activism against GBV from 25 November to 10 December.-She encouraged everyone to initiate and continue the conversations in their homes, workplaces and in all spheres of society to motivate change in mindsets and to prevent GBV from happening.","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Africa,Goal 5  Gender equality,In the news,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,Gender equality"

She said Botswana needed a deliberate policy initiative to empower other citizens to derive benefits from the waste sector.-The Minister also explained that the Botswana Cabinet approved the Integrated Waste Management Policy in April 2021. According to Kereng this policy seeks to promote deriving value out of waste through its value chain. Treating waste as valuable resource will not only lead to improving environmental aesthetic, but will also have significant economic benefits as it will provide opportunities for waste based enterprise that will improve the livelihoods of local communities. The youth are more innovative and given an opportunity and a conducive environment, they can provide local solutions to our waste management challenges.-Kereng also appealed to the private sector to come on board and actively participate in the waste recovery and recycling initiatives. She concluded by highlighting that the  success of this pilot project will lead to the rollout to other institutions in our districts, towns and cities to make this a national programme.-The other objectives of waste paper segregation in the government enclave are:-• To create awareness on sustainable waste management practices.-• To encourage segregation at source at the workplace.-• To foster public, private sector collaboration on waste management.-• To test proof a concept on waste separation at source and circular economy.","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Africa,In the news,Environment,Botswana ,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Sustainable development"

These areas are important wildlife migratory routes between the Kalahari Transfrontier Park (KTP) and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR). The duo was accompanied by the KGDEP team, representative from the Department of Town and Planning, Kgalagadi and Ghanzi Land board, Kgalagadi and Ghanzi Department of Wildlife and National Parks, Non-Governmental Organisations such as Kalahari Research and Conservation (KRC) and Cheetah Conservation Botswana (CCB).      -The wildlife migratory corridors and in general the WMAs are affected (negatively and otherwise) by other development within the areas and therefore a need to adopt good/proper rangeland management and restore degraded rangelands, while also promoting and maintaining sustainable livelihood activities. It should be noted that the area has been identified as the world’s largest wilderness.-To safeguard this pristine wilderness and taking into account all factors which have relevance to the area, the Kgalagadi and Ghanzi Drylands Ecosystem Project is in the process of developing an Integrated Land Use Management Plan (ILUMP) for the area which aims at achieving the overarching goal of improving livelihoods and conserving the Kalahari wilderness, or ecosystem. The plan is at a scale of the entire wilderness i.e. 22 million hectares.-This field visit was therefore to familiarise stakeholders with pertinent issues to be addressed by the land use plan which is being developed and understand other dynamics within the wildlife management areas. This will usher in informed decision making on all aspects pertaining to the WMAs. The team had an opportunity to meetup with community leadership, community conservation trust and village development committee members of villages in the area.

One of the areas managed by the Trust is the Nata Sanctuary. The sanctuary has overabundance of natural resources amongst them the greater and lesser flamingos. The Sanctuary was Gazetted by Botswana government as a flamingo sanctuary to provide formal protection, is a home to approximately 165 bird species and it is one of the world's most important breeding sites for greater flamingos and lesser flamingos.-According to UNESCO, it is one of the three breeding grounds of flamingos in Africa and the largest. This is an important reproduction site for flamingos, the waters of the salty lake are rich in food for these beautiful birds; the pink greater flamingos are fed with artemies a family of shrimp living in salt and alkaline waters.-For a long time people of Nata area have been affect by reoccurring of veldfires which pose risk to their life, property/infrastructure, local economies as well as the flora and fauna. It is noted that the lesser flamingo is decreasing in population according to the IUCN red list of threatened species, and if people don’t do nothing about the veld fires which continues to affect the ecosystem soon Botswana will not have any lesser flamingos roaming around Nata a problem which will affect the business specifically Avi- tourism or bird tourism.-Fire is an integral part of savannah’s ecosystem and Batswana have used it for various purposes since time immemorial. Traditionally, fire has been used as a management tool to control vegetation structure and composition, for hunting and to recycle nutrients locked in live and dead biomass. These uses have continued up to today particularly in savanna ecosystems of southern Africa and northern parts of Australia. However, improper use of fires often lead to veld fires, which are blazes that get out of control, destroying extensive tracts of forests and grasslands and may result in the loss of biodiversity and human life and it can also lead to structural fires.-The Makgadikgadi ecosystem is one of the fire prone areas in Botswana due to the vegetation composition found in the area. It is against this background that communities of Nata, Maposa, Manxotae and Sepako through the auspices of Nata Conservation Trust developed the project aimed at sustainable management of range and natural resources in their area. As key outputs from the project was the; capacity building of community members on fire management, development of the fire management strategy and the procurement of firefighting equipment.-Strategic planning was deemed important because it explains shared understanding of veldfires together with their risks and ways of combating the risks. This fire management strategy will empower people of Nata and neighboring villages to work together and overcome the problem which continue to affect their area. The management plan also will enhance the resilience of the natural ecosystem through sustaining biological diversity and human livelihoods in times of fire outbreaks. To perform and achieve all this, people from relevant departments, stakeholders, communities and experts were consulted to benefit from their skills and knowledge. This helped identify information, opinions and local factors around the villages.-The general objective of this strategy are: 1) to provide guidance to communities in the Nata, Manxotae, Sepako and Maposa areas on how to prevent and manage veld fires. 2) wildland suppression. The strategy is intended to address the Nata wildfire problems by focusing on four key areas: 1) Restore and Maintain Rangelands; 2) Fire Adapted Communities 3) Improved Response to Fire; 4) Emergency Medical Support.-About Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP): The Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP) is a corporate programme of the GEF.

The training was held in the Selebi Phikwe Economic Diversification Unit (SPEDU) region, with sessions running in Selebi Phikwe and Tonota.-In his welcome remarks, Mr. Daniel Gareebine, SDP Consultant, noted that the objective of the SDP is to increase productive capacity of SMMEs in Botswana to in turn create jobs, diversify the economy and build sustainable growth and development for the country.  UNDP has enrolled horticultural farmers in the SPEDU region, on the SDP, under the National Agro-Processing Plant (NAPro) supply chain.  In working with NAPro farmers during Year one of the SDP, Mr. Gareebine presented that it was established that ineffective technologies remain one of the major contributing factors to the low output and poor commercial performance of horticulture farmers in Botswana. Farmers do not use best practice farming methods, they do not have access to climate control equipment, access to improved inputs (e.g. seeds varieties, fertilizers) and, finally, they do not use efficient harvesting and harvest preservation methods.-Reports also indicated that farmers desire to acquire technology to improve their productive output but are constrained by lack of funding, and the lack of knowledge of available technologies and its adoption. It is in this background that the UNDP-SDP unit hosted the workshop on ‘Best Practices in Horticultural Technologies’.-The event was officially opened by Honourable Molebatsi Molebatsi, Assistant Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry. Hon. Molebatsi acknowledged the SDP for its focus on value chain development in Botswana as it is in line with Governments strategic goals to advance development in key industries towards increased employment, business development for SMMEs and wealth creation for Batswana. The Assistant Minister highlighted that COVID-19 has taught us lessons about the dangers of not being self-sufficient. “We dream of a Botswana where we will have enough food that we would not need to import from other countries, but that we would become the supplier through some of the trade agreements such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)” said the Assistant Minister.-Hon. Molebatsi further expressed the commitment of the government to continue fostering the partnership between MITI and UNDP Botswana through programmes such as the SDP. He called for all those stakeholders involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem to pull together to ensure synergies in their efforts to build SMME development in Botswana. In closing, Hon. Molebatsi called for support from the private sector, particularly the financing institutions to come on board to back the programme and provide financial support to its suppliers and encouraged the farmers to take full advantage of the opportunity presented through the horticulture technologies training.-The objective of the workshop was to impart awareness and knowledge on best practice horticulture technologies for improved productive output and economic efficiency of farming enterprises. The training was attended by fifty participants, twenty of whom were farmers on the NAPRO supply chain, together with other UNDP stakeholders in the agri-business sector such as the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Food Security, SPEDU, NAPRO, the Poverty Eradication Coordination Unit (PECU), Local Enterprise Authority (LEA), First National Bank Botswana (FNBB) and the SDP Consultants working in the region.-Farmers were taken through lessons on irrigation methods and their investments costs; sustainability and climate smart agriculture; crop production in controlled environments; managing a seedling nursery; soil health testing; plant pests and diseases; and scaling an agribusiness. The training was advanced through a two-day classroom session followed by a 1-day farm tour and soil test demonstration at Ratoccs Farms in Ditladi, owned by a female SDP Year 1 Supplier.-About UNDP-SDP: The UNDP-SDP brings together three partners in a tripartite partnership.

The three simplified agreements are The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (US market); EU/SADC EPA (EU market); and the SADC Trade Protocol (SADC market)-In 2020 the Government of Botswana through the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry with the support of the United Nations Development Programme secured the services of an expert to simplify the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), EU-SADC EPA and SADC Trade Protocol into plain and less technical English language to facilitate their effective utilisation by the business community, including the SMEs.-Botswana is the world’s largest rough diamond producer. Total exports for February 2019, were valued at P3,178.7 million, with 88.9% (P2,826.1 million) attributed to exports of Diamonds, followed by Machinery & Electrical Equipment and Salt & Soda Ash with 3.4 % (P108. 6 million) and 1.4% (P44.3 million) respectively. Meat and Meat Products and Gold contributed 1.2% (P39.3 million) and 1% (P32.2 million) respectively.-Botswana’s GDP per capita was about USD8,000 in 2018 according to World Bank, which has guaranteed its middle-income status. Despite Botswana’s upper middle-income status, it suffers high rates of unemployment and a small manufacturing sector.-Over the years, Botswana has leveraged on creating avenues/strategic partnerships with a view to expand the economic base. These efforts include being party to trade and investment agreements, among others, which, are expected to gradually improve the contribution of non-traditional commodities in Botswana’s economic transformation agenda.-The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) is one of the trade agreements. It was enacted in May 2000 and in 2015 was extended by ten (10) years, that is 2015-2025, to allow eligible AGOA beneficiaries to maximise and come up with sustainable and effective initiatives for utilising the existing provisions offered by the U.S. In 2017, Botswana developed a response strategy to capitalise on the duty-free market access and private sector development provisions under AGOA.-The Department of International Trade (DIT) in the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) is tasked to ensure effective implementation of existing trade agreements. The trade agreements as written, are technically complex and are not easy to understand by the general public and the business community who are their key target users. It should ordinarily follow that if the trade agreements are easily understood by the business community, their level of use will increase and the benefits thereof will be realized, especially in relation to the following areas:-·         Increase in trade; exports and imports;-·         Increase in foreign direct investment;-·         Creation of wealth;-·         Creation of sustainable jobs/employment; and-·         Acquisition and nurturing of applicable and sustainable skills and expertise.-Engagements between the public and the private sector have been undertaken regarding collaborative efforts on enhancing the implementation challenges for Trade Agreements. One major challenge was the lack of uptake by the private sector and the business community, which is attributed to the complexity of the technical language of the trade agreements and lack of understanding of the market access requirements for the products, among other factors.-Further, it is expected that the Trade Agreements should be aligned to the objectives and anticipated output of the National Export Strategy, Economic Diversification Drive Strategy and other key national economic development strategies that will be used to achieve the aspirations of Vision 2036.-Therefore, the simplified texts of the above listed trade agreements are intended to assist Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the business community through the private sector as well as civil society in both rural and urban areas to understand the markets of interest, assess the benefits thereof and have an appreciation of the detailed processes needed to utilise these Trade Agreements.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Fast facts,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Botswana "

As part of the domestication process, efforts have been employed to align the SDGs with national development frameworks, namely Vision 2036, National Development Plan (NDP 11) as well as District and Urban Development Plans. Other notable initiatives include development of the Domesticated Indicated Framework (DIF), formation of the necessary institutional structure as well as development of the National Roadmap on SDGs, a strategic document that guides implementation efforts at both national and sub-national levels. The Roadmap identifies six broad/strategic areas to accelerate implementation of the SDGs, being;-·         National Ownership, Leadership and Coordination-·         Advocacy, Sensitization and Awareness-·         Planning and Implementation-·         Data, Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation-·         Strengthening the SDGs Institutional Arrangements-·         Policy Research and Interventions-Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), being the SDG Secretariat, ensures that strategic interventions that contribute towards Botswana’s SDG realization and linked to the above mentioned broad areas are in place. One such is the development of the SDG Planning Guidelines to support Planning Officers in line Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and other stakeholders to integrate SDGs into planning instruments and thus ensuring their systematic implementation. The initiative, executed in collaboration with United Nations (UN) Botswana, specifically United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is in line with the Roadmap’s broad/strategic area of Planning and Implementation, which calls for the alignment of the national and local levels development plans with the SDGs and their targets and indicators, among others.

This follows the realization that waste has not been taken as a resource in the country and this waste could be used for other uses. The reuse of waste to generate energy is an opportunity that Botswana must tap into for future use.  Several waste streams are available in various agro-industrial facilities which can be utilized for generation of energy.

The pandemic is a big blow to different sectors and groups and especially to the vulnerable ones. The informal sector businesses and workers have not been spared. In fact, they have been disproportionately affected.  -As part of responding to the early days of Covid- 19 in Botswana UNDP together with UN agencies supported the development of three Covid – 19 Recovery Plans for  the Private Sector, Social Protection and  the Informal Sector.-Globally:  The numbers speak very loudly about the level of importance of the informal sector to the economy. Globally, the informal sector employs 61% of the working-age population (2 billion workers). ILO estimates that in Sub-Saharan Africa, the informal sector accounts for 86% of men and 92% of women in employment. Unfortunately, most of these workers are not covered by social protection.- Who are the Informal Sector?-Informal workers encompass various sectors of work, ranging from subsistence small holder farmers, gardeners,  urban street vendors and market traders, that you and I buy from each week,  waste pickers, domestic workers, unpaid family workers, migrant workers, as well as many platform and gig workers.-The plan agreed on a definition for Botswana that identifies them as “.... all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in practice – not covered or sufficiently covered by formal arrangements”.-For instance, they are not formally registered as businesses (with CIPA) or workers and are not registered as tax-payers (with BURS).-The informal sector constitutes 5.3% of GDP, it is estimated that there are more than 116,000 informal sector businesses which employ more than 191,000 people. It is also a sector that is rapidly expanding, growing 233% from 2007 to 2015. 67% of informal businesses are at least partially women-owned. Women and youth are among some of the vulnerable groups.-ERTP acknowledges that the informal sector businesses and informal workers provide social safety net and contribute to household resilience (ERTP).- What  was the Impact of Covid-19?- As UNDP, we are happy and proud to have rendered support during the critical time to analyse the impact of the pandemic as part of developing the Plan.-The analyses shows that the initial government Covid -19 relief plan was geared towards wage subsidies and financial relief benefitting formal businesses. It became clear that the informal sector had become the ‘missing middle’ both in terms of policy making and the economic response.-Their annual income which was already relatively low was completely wiped out due to the restrictions on travel, movement and meetings, especially during the earlier period of the pandemic.- As you may know, about 16.3% (about 380,000) of our population live below the poverty datum line and 5.8% live in extreme poverty (about 135,000). So we do not want the informal sector falling below  the  poverty datum line.  Keeping the informal sector in business  is helping to reduce the numbers  falling  into poverty.  So it is in all our interests to ensure we support this sector.-What are the Informal Sector  main issues?-COVID-19 has brought to light and further exacerbated the vulnerability of the informal sector businesses and in turn those whose survival is (directly and indirectly) dependent on these businesses’ operations.-Data shows that nearly 50% of these businesses have challenges accessing operating space and close to 40% of them have trouble accessing the market for their products and services.-Building Back Better,  the Plan : We were motivated to support the development of the plan because as a global development organisation, it is in our interest to see a positive change in the lives not only of the informal sector but other vulnerable groups.  We see this plan as opportunity to build-back-better  from Covid -19 and emerge from it stronger.-Fundamentally the plan focus on, in brief :  highlighting the need for dedicated policy-making and government support structures  for the informal sector. It calls  for  support to women and youth-led businesses . It calls for an inclusive recovery and  a broader platform for economic diversification so that the informal workers have  access to training , friendly spaces to work in while  also having opportunities to market their products .-I want to thank all those who helped and participated in some way to the development of the plan including the Informal Sector Associations-UNDP  support to the implementation of the Plan:-UNDP HQ has put together a Rapid Response Facility, to Covid -19 not only to develop this and other recovery plans but also to support their implementation. A seed fund of over two million Pula has been availed to support part of the initial implementation of the plan. The recovery plan is anchored on two Strategic Goals with 11 strategic objectives.-I am pleased to share that UNDP will support some aspects/actions from 6 of the 11 strategic objectives. Among the areas that will be supported are:-1.     Engagement of Technical Advisor to help the MITI and LEA with kickstarting the key activities of an Informal Sector Unit.-2.     Setting up of a Business Intelligence System to ensure data-driven and evidence-based decision making for the informal sector businesses.-3.     Promotion of digitisation of business operations by the informal sector and in particular offering digital training and virtual spaces .-4.     In recognition of the risks that are faced by the informal sector businesses and informal sector workers, commissioning of a feasibility study on a social insurance scheme for the informal sector.-We are already working with the MITI and LEA to realise the intended objectives of these actions. The whole objective is to not only see the informal sector recovering from the devastating effects of COVID-19 as quickly as possible, but to also see them being built into stronger and more resilient businesses that will find it attractive to formalise their operations.-I do cherish the long-term partnership with MITI and am looking forward to the new partnerships with LEA and the informal sector associations.-In closing, I want to loudly say  that this informal sector plan  is about acknowledging and appreciating  the informal sector   and to say again  that  the ‘missing middle’   is no longer missing . The plan has set out a policy direction for you and will provide economic and social  opportunities  as you are valued and you have a voice.  You have been heard.   We are proud to work with MITI and LEA  and the Informal Sectors associations to   assist  you to  access operating spaces  and to access the market for  your products and services. We are pleased to  be part of providing training  especially in digital skills  so you can  carry on your business on line . I have no doubt we have so much to learn from you and you will be the ones spearheading  in Botswana  the digital age and businesses .-  Pula, Pula!!!!!!-Download the Botswana Informal Sector recovery plan","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Coronavirus COVID-19,Crisis response,Health,In the news,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities"

The mission entailed consultations with an array of stakeholders including Dikgosi (Tribal leadership), BORAVAST Trust board members and others. Having supported the establishment of the BORAVAST Charcoal production project which was launched in July 2020 and the fodder production business venture, the KGDEP has further facilitated capacity building initiatives for these business ventures as a way of ensuring their long-term sustainability.-Of essence to the trust and its business sustainability is a functional governance structure and this being the case with the BORAVAST, the trust will hold its annual general meeting (AGM) on 24th March 2021. This AGM will be an elective forum for a new board of trustees. The process is also supported by the KGDEP and as part of the implementation of its (KGDEP) Gender Mainstreaming Strategy the project views the AGM as an opportunity to increase active participation of women in leadership positions and therefore encourages stakeholders to play an active role in attainment of this. Consulted stakeholders during the mission strongly advocated for the KGDEP to provide refresher training for the newly elected trustees on issues of governance and further training to the charcoal producers to improve their efficiency and workmanship. The Local Enterprise Authority (LEA) which has been engaged by the KGDEP to provide business management and records keeping training for the BORAVAST has also pledged to compliment the KGDEP support through availing more resources for the strengthening business management structures. With this LEA support and further support from the KGDEP, the BORAVAST will be upscaling its businesses’ production capacities and contributing positively to the improvement of the community livelihoods.-The KGDEP will continue its support for the BORAVAST business ventures and will be working with Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (BUAN) and the Department of Agriculture Research to assist the community in improving its fodder production venture. This assistance will be in the form of skills training, research into determining the nutrition levels of the produced fodder and how it can be enhanced and other necessary support.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,In the news,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities"

Positioned at the tip of the borders of Botswana and Namibia, Shakawe is made up of small farming communities, rural homesteads and some government offices. Small scale fishing from the Okavango River forms a means of seasonal income for some of the locals. Livestock farming and crop cultivation is done at a small scale, however, the lack of knowledge about adaptive farming practices, coupled with the lack of finances to invest in relevant inputs has been a challenge for many farmers, who rely solely on the crops for income to sustain their households.-“I was not working after finishing secondary school and it was really tough , I used to sell airtime outside the shops every day. This is just so I can get something” says Maria Khukhwane. The 32-year-old was born and bred in Shakawe and had difficulty in finding a job or securing steady means of income.-“I used to visit my parents at the homestead and saw that they survive from farming so after a while I decided to start farming also.”  Maria dedicated herself to planting onions, rape and green peppers on a piece of land allocated to her by her parents. Initially she sold most of her harvest to the local school, however, her crops could not survive the river drying up and water becoming scarce. She also realised there   was a need to improve her farming methods.-Maria’s friend Benny Morundu, (33) experienced a similar situation “I have a degree in Accounting and worked in Gaborone and Maun. After some time I saw it is better to come back to Shakawe and just use the land here to start farming” says Benny. He started with planting green peppers, but struggled to get a market for the produce and barely broke even. Another challenge, was that he did not have the necessary skills to sustain the crops during harsh seasons.-In October 2020, Benny and Maria were two of the six farmers selected as beneficiaries of the UNDP supported and GEF financed OKACOM Climate Smart Horticulture Demonstration project in collaboration with the Botswana Ministry of Agriculture Development and Food Security (MADFS). The project aimed to capacitate farmers to implement climate smart agricultural techniques, with the provision of shade nets, irrigation systems, seedlings and water tanks. Each farmer was guided by a dedicated mentor, who trained the farmers on how to cultivate under the shade net, the use of organic fertilisers and the relevant methods of irrigation.-From the shade net erected on her land, Maria has so far harvested 200 kilograms of baby marrows since February 2021, which she has sold to local retailer. The mother of two says, “With these profits, I managed to buy more seeds so I can start with cabbage because now I know this is the season for that crop”.-“Since last year, I managed to send 614 cucumbers to Gaborone for sale and I know for sure my product is competitive and of good quality.” says Benny, who has harvested a total of 2000 cucumbers so far and has also supplied a local retailer in Shakawe with his produce. “I really appreciate the support I received to start with the cucumbers and there is even more potential because now I can also use the shade net to grow other vegetables too. I was able to get money to buy seeds to plant a variety of crops. I am able to pay my workers on the farm.” He adds.-The demonstration farmers have reaped the benefits of using climate smart methods, harvesting and taking the fresh produce to local market. The mother of two says, “Me and my children depend on these crops. I sell and use that money for our daily needs. I am very hopeful, because now I understand how to use the shade net and I already have a market for my next crop.”-The project has identified the need to further capacitate farmers with record management and basic bookkeeping skills required by MADFS for program support and monitoring.  This has been addressed through a partnership with Local Enterprise Authority (LEA) which has recently facilitated training workshops for farmers in Maun and Shakawe.-Story and pictures by; Nelao Haimbodi, Communications & Outreach Manager, OKACOM ","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Africa,Climate change,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Botswana ,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,English"

Botswana has the 2nd highest rates of rape per capita in the world and the Botswana Police record an average of 6 rape cases per day.-When giving remarks at the occasion the UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Ms. Margunn Indreboe Alshaikh said the campaign aims to inspire everyone to take action and commit to ending GBV in Botswana, and to provide critical information to victims seeking help.-To do this, the conversations on preventing GBV must take place in the spaces where people are already talking and interacting with each other. Therefore, UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs and Kgalagadi Breweries Limited to to launch a campaign across more than 2000 liquor outlets and bars to rally people around the prevention of GBV and remind consumers of their responsibility to act responsibly and take a stance against GBV in their communities.-Liquor outlets and bars operators have since placed GBV themed posters and social distancing floor stickers in their business facilities. Mr Destiny Bulikwe, one of the operators in Gaborone thanked the tripartite for initiating the campaign and explained that the floor stickers in his business engaged customers in conversations around GBV while they waited their turn to buy. He said that since the Government suspended the sale of alcohol in the country as of 3 January 2021 he has resolved to extend his liquor outlet facility and pleaded for more branded stickers to cater for the expansion.-Ms. Kabonolo Loeto who also sells alcohol in Gaborone said she placed the posters strategically in her liquor outlet for customers to see and read. “The posters provide very useful information to my customers such as Botswana Police Service’s GBV helpline which can be reached any time to save the victims of GBV”, explained Kabonolo.-This campaign entails engaging everyone to take a stand against GBV through their everyday actions and conversations. Only by realising that ending GBV is everyone’s responsibility and a whole-of-society problem, can we jointly, and through partnerships such as this, prevent GBV from happening at all.- The campaign materials are installed in KBL mainstream outlets, i.e. bars and bottle stores, nationwide. It runs in parallel with a campaign to encourage alcohol consumers about responsible drinking and promoting good health and (mental) wellbeing of its consumers and gender equality, as per the UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 5, adopted by the brewery.-UNDP looks forward to expanding its support and strengthen its partnerships with the Government of Botswana, private sector and civil society as key actors in the fight against GBV in Botswana.",['Icon of SDG 05'],"Africa,Goal 5  Gender equality,News,Botswana "

The event was  themed “Building resilient farmers through adopting Climate Smart Agricultural Practices’ and was hosted by Dolphins Farm owned by Mrs Gaotshwarwe Otimile (54 years). The official program started with an address by representatives of MoADFS, OKACOM and the demonstration farmers. This was followed by a tour of the hosting farm led by a narrative from Mrs Otimile who offered an account of the implementation of climate smart horticulture methods, the provision of infrastructure and the mentorship support received. Two more farms were visited, with varying high yield crops aimed at meeting the demand posed by specific target markets. The delegation of attendants were afforded the opportunity to pose questions and share insights on lessons learned by the farmers.-Experiences Shared and Lessons Learnt-Attendants were informed of the peer learning approach of experienced horticulture farmers in mentoring other farmers. The highlight was the practice of the Horticulture Demonstration Farmers who volunteered to mentor others in collaboration with the local Extension Officers from MoADFS in:-Expansion and Replication-As a result of the knowledge acquired from the demonstration project, some of the farmers have gone on to construct new shade nets to increase their production in a controlled environment. In order to share knowledge among others, the demonstration farmers are now hosting aspiring farmers to practically train them on aspects of soil preparation, management, seedlings production scheduling, care and management. Farmers have learnt how to do regular observations of their crops for potential pest outbreak and prepare timely actions. The following approaches for replication and upscaling have been identified:-Sustainability and Further Support-Financial Institutions are keen to educate to farmers and aspiring farmers on the requirements for accessing finance in response to the national call for Botswana to achieve her aspirations of attaining food security, while reducing country’s food import bill.

These 10 and other 34 Botswana citizen-owned Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have all benefitted from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) flagship Business Supplier Development Programme (SDP).  The UNDP SDP was rolled out in earnest in March 2019 bringing together three partners: Suppliers – local citizen-owned SMEs, Buyers - large local and regional companies and local SDP trained Consultants to ensure that SMEs were mentored to grow and remain sustainable. -The consultants’ ability to mentor the SMEs, on every aspect of their business, over a 10month period, to ensure the quality required by the Buyers were met, has proven to be an essential ingredient for the success of the SDP. Notwithstanding, the SDP would not have been possible without the great collaboration, and willingness, of the Buyers, to buy locally from the SMEs.  UNDP is eternally grateful to all the Buyers who remained steadfast in their support right from the beginning. Their desire to grow the local economy has paid off as evident from the many success stories of some of these SMEs below. The Buyers provided a ready- made market for the SMEs. Furthermore, profound credit goes to the SME leaders who were determined, from the start, for their entities to benefit from the hands-on mentoring support and the markets provided through SDP.  Their vision was, and continues to be, clear. They wanted to grow their business, be competitive, improve their standards, diversify their products and of course improve their profits. Their hard work paid off.",[],

The project focused on supporting the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), as the coordinators of SDGs for Botswana. Four significant results were achieved as follows:-Result 1: The Role of the SDG Coordinating Ministry (MFED) Defined-The first phase of the support focused on clarifying the work of MFED as the lead/coordinating agency for the SDGs. In this context, a “Guidance Note on Executing the Coordination Role by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development” was developed, following extensive consultations with key stakeholders.  The Guidance Note unbundled the coordination role into seven (7) functions and mapped out specific actions to be carried out under each.  The seven include: -i) Planning and Budgeting-ii) Advocacy, sensitization and awareness creation-iii) Implementation-iv) Monitoring, data collection, analysis and reporting-v) SDGs Research-vi) Stakeholder Coordination-vii) Resource Mobilization-These seven functions to be impledged by MFED are different in scope to similar functions that the  line miniseries  will undertake as part of SDG implementation. The former is focusing on providing overall guidance to line ministries on what to do to ensure an all of government approach.  The Project  developed a slide presentation of the 7 coordination functions. Assisting MFED to unbundle their coordination role helped them to leap frog their work  in advancing SDGs implementation in the country. Previously MFED role was seen  to be  about bringing  other  ministries  together to discuss  and report progress.  -Result 2: Tailored Made SDGs Planning Guidelines Developed and Rollout-Given that only 42 SDG indicators were included in the national Develop Plan 11, 2017- 2023, the Project supported MFED to develop tailored made SDG Planning guidelines to assist ministries to plan for the implementation of specific SDG targets and indicators, using a structured approach . The SDG Planning Guidelines and Tools are currently being piloted in selected ministries. The global approach to planning for the implementation of SDGs has been mainly about adopting an “alignment” approach. These planning guidelines are unique as they provide a structured 5 stage planning process on how to integrate specific SDG targets and indicators into ministries plans. Again, a great instrument to accelerate SDG implementation in a country.-Result 3: Status of SDG Implementation Defined Using Three Variables-UNDP undertook a study to assess the Status of implementation of the SDGs focusing on three variables as follows:-• the extent to which the Government and partners are implementing actions/programmes aimed at addressing each of the goals, targets and indicators considered relevant for Botswana;-• the extent to which specific SDG targets and SDG indicators have been integrated/mainstreamed in policy and planning frameworks, both at national and district levels; and-• progress made in the implementation of the Botswana SDGs Roadmap in line with the strategic areas considered critical for successful implementation of the SDGs.-The summary findings are captured in the following Table 1.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Botswana ,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 5  Gender equality,partnerships,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 14  Life below water,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

She said, “The Programme was designed to contribute to Botswana’s exports in an ever-changing and increasingly competitive global environment.”-On her part the UNDP Resident Representative Ms. Jacinta Barrins explained that her office is excited to be part of the launch of the Revised Botswana Exporter Development Programme. She said it is very important that existing and potential businesses  are encouraged to export and are assisted to ensure their product meet the standards required by the markets.  BITC is well positioned to provide  this support-The pursuit of export-led growth is a key objective of Botswana’s Vision 2036 and central to the National Development Plan (NDP 11). Historically, Botswana’s economic growth has been export-led, particularly during the period from the early 1970s to the mid-2000s as the diamond industry expanded rapidly. However, diamond exports’ contribution to the economy has been declining, in relative terms, over the past two decades, and in 2018 were equivalent to 24 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared to over 50 percent in the mid-1980s and 40 percent of GDP in the early 2000s.-Therefore, it was found necessary to diversify exports and promote the growth of non-diamond goods and services to ensure sustained GDP growth, balance of payments stability and employment creation. Institutionally, the Government established the Botswana Export Development and Investment Authority (BEDIA) in 1997 to help promote export-led growth. In 2006, the Botswana Government developed its first five year National Export Strategy (2006-2010) whose key objective was to make Botswana more internationally competitive and more productive in order to increase and diversify its export base thereby raising incomes and the standards of living of Batswana.-In 2012, BEDIA was merged with the then International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to establish the Botswana Investment and Trade Centre (BITC). After the launch of the second National Export Strategy (2010-2016), the Government decided to establish a Botswana Exporter Development Programme (BEDP) that spanned from 2013 to 2017, that was aimed at increasing exports through targeted interventions undertaken by various agencies and service providers. The Botswana Investment and Trade Centre is responsible for managing BEDP.-The Revised Botswana Exporter Development Programme was developed with the support of UNDP. It is a programme that seeks to implement the aspect of the Botswana National Export Strategy by building the capacity of local private sector to produce products that are ready for and competitive in the international markets-For more information and media interviews, contact:-Lebogang Tlhaloso, UNDP Communications Associate - Tell: +267 363 3745; | Mobile:+267 71 686 682; Email: lebogang.tlhaloso@undp.org-Johnson Tsoro Maiketso, Programme Specialist – Economic Diversification and Inclusive Growth , Tel: +267 363 3710 Email: johnson.maiketso@undp.org","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,In the news,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Botswana ,Goal 2  Zero hunger"

It is one of the very few major interior delta systems that do not flow into a sea or ocean, with a wetland system that is almost intact. The delta has two international designation under the Ramsar and the World Heritage Convention, and this has contributed to the protection and management of the landscape. The site was designated as a Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar Site) on 12 September 1996. At the 38th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2014, it was inscribed on the World Heritage List as the 1000th World Heritage Site due to its exceptional biodiversity and scenic values. As a World Heritage site, it is a protected cultural and natural heritage of international importance under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention.

The Biogas Project seeks to facilitate low-carbon investments in the production and utilization of biogas from agro-waste in the districts of South-eastern Botswana. The project aims to assist Government of Botswana through three project components:-To meet the above components, the project through the Department of Energy (DOE) is currently in the process of constructing and implementing the 200 small scale biogas digesters in the South-Eastern part of Botswana to provide a sustainable solution to these problems. By the end of the project more than 200 households will be provided with their own biogas plant to utilize the free and sustainable energy contained in their animals’ excrement. The biogas is used for cooking, household lighting and water boiling. Water is often boiled as a purification measure, preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.

A call for applications was made for the potential beneficiaries to apply and benefit from the project through part-financing the construction of the small-scale underground fixed dome biogas digesters where by the beneficiary purchase their own materials as per the Bill Of Quantities designed and provided by the project and the Biogas-project contribute by paying for construction labour.-To date 28 small-scale biogas digesters has commenced construction since July 1st, 2020 and five (5) digesters have since been completed and fed, undergoing retention time of minimum thirty (30) days for the digesters to begin biogas production for utilization.-The biogas digesters will primarily be utilized to meet residential energy requirement mainly for cooking and space heating. This applicable at farms, residential homes and the SMEs. The main feedstock being used is cow-dung and chicken droppings.-The project has trained and certified 33 masons to undertake the construction of the 200 digesters of which 23 are male and 10 are female. The designs of all different completed and under construction digesters sizes have been created/designed by key project partner being Botswana Institute for Technology Research and Innovation (BITRI) and they are all certified and approved for utilization. For the project’s sustainability and continuity beyond UNDP technical support and for the roll-out throughout the country, the project trained fifteen (15) trainer of trainers to facilitate the construction and implementation of the small-scale biogas digesters through the country.-One of the beneficiaries of the project, Ms. Phatsimo Mmifinyana (44) has installed a 10 cubic meter (10m3) biogas digester at her farm in Nkoyaphiri, Kweneng District which is fed by the dung from cows in the nearby kraal, chicken droppings and piggery waste.

This initiative is delivered through a joint programme “Support to the fulfilment of Human Rights, access to Justice and the Empowerment of Youth and Women” Project (2018 – 2021) which seeks to increase access to law and legal services as a way of promoting the rule of law and access to justice in Botswana.-“As Botswana seeks to accelerate towards a knowledge-based economy and the broader transformation agenda, access to justice and legal empowerment and a clear and accessible legal and policy regulatory framework are more essential than ever,” said Margunn Indreboe Alshaikh, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative to Botswana at the event. With the COVID-19 pandemic, access to technology and digital literacy have become critical for ensuring equal access to and continuity of services as well as economic recovery. Ms. Indreboe Alshaikh added that open access to legal information also promotes investor confidence which is key to inclusive and sustainable economic growth.-The Botswana Legal Information Institute (BotswanaLII) Project was established under the joint UNDP Government Programme to provide access to legal information online and free of charge.  In fact, the project is building on the work done by the Attorney General’s Chambers in establishing Botswana e-laws and the legislations published online up until 2013. The courts have also been publishing cases and distributing them on CD Rom for a fee.-Botswana is well placed, therefore, to move forward, to leapfrog into new technology and ensure its legal documents are widely available online, free of charge and Government welcomes the partnership with UNDP to achieve this goal.-A Reference Group was formed in April 2019 to guide the process of establishing the BoswanaLII. The Reference Group includes Government Printing and Publishing Services, Administration of Justice, Attorney Generals’ Chambers, the National Assembly, University of Botswana and the Department of Information Technology.-Under the auspices of the Project, African LII, Laws Africa and Kenya Law visited Botswana in 2019 to share their experiences of providing free access to law online, the challenges, the pitfalls and the successes.

In order to ensure the credibility of the Ombudsman at national and international levels, the Government was also encouraged ensure compliance with the Paris Principles in formulation of the Ombudsman Amendment Bill and to ensure the institution was well-equipped to promote and protect human rights in Botswana.-This year saw Botswana, for the first time, being included in the global Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which was launched on the 16th July 2020 in Gaborone. UNDP is working together with Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) to develop an MPI for Botswana that measures deprivations across a number of indicators, including in health, education and living standards.-UNDP continues to support the Coordinating Office for People with Disabilities on the development of a National Disability Policy, National Disability Strategy and Disability Law, and accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Ms. Barrins encouraged the Government to accelerate finalisation and adoption of the National Disability Framework. She added that the UNDP is ready to support the incorporation of any revisions to the Framework arising from the Cabinet process. The Government was also encouraged to accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD).-On anti-corruption  matters, the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) has received UNDP support to: finalise the National Anti-Corruption Policy, develop a Quality Management System, build capacity of officers to develop a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and Manual, and develop regulations and a training manual to operationalise the Whistleblowing Act. Ms. Barrins requested the Honourable Minister to support the finalisation and endorsement of the National Anti-Corruption Policy at Cabinet and Parliamentary levels, as a concerted stride towards making Botswana a high-income country.","['Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,In the news,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Egypt had 13 million tourists in 2019, ranking 19th in the world.-·       We have recently witnessed the decline in tourism due to the Pandemic and the Ukraine crises. It's time for us to think earnestly about the development of the tourism industry that is more sustainable and resilient and acts as a catalyst to unlock local socio-economic development in an integrated and transformative manner. -·       At UNDP, we refer to sustainable tourism or green tourism as the kind of tourism that takes complete account of its current and future impacts on the economy, society and the environment. It is tourism that does not just address the needs of its visitors but also considers the rights and needs of its host communities. -·       Accordingly, the tourism sector should promote three main dimensions: environmental integrity, social justice and inclusive economic development.-·       You will agree that Egypt tourism is in danger from global and local events. -·       Changing climate and warming seas have bleached the spectacular coral reefs.  Strong currents and unpredictable weather patterns are eroding our beaches. These events threaten not just the tourism sector but the survival and well-being of ordinary citizens across the country. -·       In addition to the consequences of global warming, localized human-made activities have hurt the environment. The damage created by sea plastic wastes is just one example. -·       The second dimension of Sustainable Tourism is social and cultural development. Cultural knowledge and practices should be revived, professionalized or used to find new developments in the interaction with visitors. The Tourism Sector can employ efforts in this regard to drive local economies and enrich local cultures.-·       The third dimension of Sustainable Tourism is enhancing equality and economic justice among the local population by giving them the chance to engage in the tourism sector through the rich knowledge of the different areas in the country.-·       Sustainable practices in tourism development also require business operators to assess the future of tourism in Egypt. Globally, we are seeing rapid changes in how tourism is practiced. These changes are coming about to complement changes in travelers' mindsets, who are increasingly aware of how their decisions have lasting impacts on local communities. There is also a greater interest from travelers to interact and experience local communities and their ways of life. The tourism sector needs to assess and adapt to these global changes to be sustainable. -·       UNDP has partnered with the government on critical initiatives such as installing PVs in hotels and museums and some protected areas such as Wadi Hitan. This will continue with the implementation of the Green Sharm Project soon to start, including the banning of plastic bags with support from the European Union. -·       Not to mention the mainstreaming of biodiversity into the tourism sector project, which was monitoring the drafting of the four guidelines we are launching today.-·       Today's event gives UNDP a new hope to engage in Sustainable Tourism Initiatives across Egypt.-·       Hopefully, these four guidelines we are launching today will lead to lasting, positive impacts for the country, ensuring that every aspect of our culture and environment is conserved, protected, and, wherever possible, enhanced.-·       Thank you.",['Icon of SDG 15'],"Egypt,Speeches,Goal 15  Life on land"

In 2018, TBHF initiated the operation of a two-floor Ready Made Garments (RMG) factory in El Maana village in Qena which now accommodates 96 young women.-TBHF helped ENID renovate two rural health units, in Isna District, Luxor and El Waqf District, Qena. In addition, TBHF supported ENID to implement its model of integrated interventions in literacy, and vocational training for women, together with preschool classes for their children in several villages in Qena.-The partners visited the first RMG factory in Qena located in El Maana village. TBHF support for this factory enabled ENID to acquire up to 152 sewing and related machines. The factory operates 26 days per month with a daily production capacity of up to 750 pieces including polo-T-shirts, training pants, and uniforms.-With the additional support of the Government of Japan, the RMG factory was able to be responsive to regional needs to produce medical face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming one of the first factories in Upper Egypt that started producing face masks, with a daily production capacity of up to 6,000 masks per day.-The delegation also attended a vocational training workshop teaching local women in the Nagaa Qoteib village to produce pre-school uniforms and bedsheets. This vocational training supported by TBHF combines both sewing and literacy classes, which helps women gain marketable job experience and earn income by working at the factory.-During the visit, UNDP Resident Representaive, Alessandro Fracassetti, stated: “women are disproportionately affected by poverty  and illiteracy. This is true for many women in rural areas, who often face the challenge of not having access to economic opportunities or education. This joint project is testament to how women in rural areas, with timely and targeted support, can grow personally and professionally. Investing in women matters now more than ever”.- -For more info:-Fatma Elzahraa Yassin, Communications Head, fatma.yassin@undp.org ","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Egypt,Press release,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth"

We have numerous joint projects supporting Egypt on its digital transformation journey.-•       We are all especially grateful for the crucial role Egypt Post has played in helping the country respond rapidly and innovatively to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.-•       Throughout this crisis, Egypt Post has remained the primary channel for providing government support to vulnerable communities across the country.-•       With over 155 financial, postal, governmental and social services, Egypt Post continues to undertake innovations to serve people better and to ensure that no one is left behind.-•       These innovations have provided crucial support for the country’s bold vision of developing an inclusive economy and society in accordance with the government’s 2030 vision.-•       Today we are celebrating the latest of these innovations – the new Yalla App.-•       This app will significantly expand digital financial inclusion in Egypt, giving many more citizens a greater chance of leading a decent life.-•       Financial inclusion has been shown to be an effective way to reduce extreme poverty and boost economic growth.-•       In this way, financial inclusions can help boost the country’s progress on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the key SDG principle of leaving no one behind.-•       As we all know, Egypt Post has already achieved financial inclusion for 25 million citizens through its saving accounts, providing digital financial services through electronic payment cards, ATM services, a mobile app, and other advanced digital services.-•       UNDP has enjoyed a close partnership with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and Egypt Post for over 15 years.-•       In this time, we have collaborated successfully on many fronts, building institutional capacity, modernizing delivery mechanisms, and enhancing the accessibility of services.-•       In recent years, we have been especially delighted to cooperate with Egypt Post in its development of digital financial services, supporting this important transformation through UNDP’s global network and technical expertise.-•       The future of development is digital.-•       Digital technology will be a fundamental driver of change, reshaping economies, governments, and civil society – impacting almost every aspect of development.-•       While digitalization opens up countless opportunities, it also comes with many challenges - including issues of data privacy, cybercrime, and misinformation disseminated through digital platforms.-•       In addition, rapid change can be disruptive to governments and may further exacerbate inequalities.-•       Taking all these factors into consideration, UNDP worldwide has launched its digital strategy for 2022–2025 with the primary aim of helping countries achieve the SDGs.-•       At the same time, the Egyptian Government has been accelerating digital transformation and financial inclusion by creating opportunities to deliver more responsive and effective services to all citizens.-•       And today with the launch of the Yalla App, Egypt Post is again supporting these efforts by serving as a crucial channel to ensure no one is left behind.-•       Developing low-cost, innovative and customer-centred financial products is a key part of these efforts.-•       The importance of providing and expanding these services can be seen from the statistics of the Central Bank of Egypt for financial inclusion rate. This rate reached 54% in the year 2021. With less than 40% of all Egyptians thus using the banking system, it is essential to expand access to financial products like savings accounts, loans, credit and insurance.-•       These statistics further highlight the importance of supporting the expansion of financial literacy throughout the Egyptian population.-•       Expanding financial literacy here means not only raising public awareness of financial services and products but also addressing the behavioural barriers that inhibit the uptake of financial services and hinder digital financial inclusion.-•       There are strong grounds for hope in the transformation of finance worldwide and in Egypt. According to a recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute, digital finance alone could benefit billions of people by spurring inclusive growth that adds $3.7 trillion to the GDP of emerging economies within a decade.-•       And according to a recent report on digital finance in the MENA region, Egypt was recognized as the country with the most dynamic digital finance services environment, enabled by political leadership in expanding financial inclusion.-•       In 2020, digital finance services witnessed an annual growth of 30%.  In addition, Egypt has prioritized financial inclusion for women in its national financial inclusion strategy.-•       And here we are today to witness another milestone along this journey!-•       Speaking on behalf of UNDP, I am happy to assure you that we fully share and support your commitment to achieving Egypt’s vision 2030.-•       Once again: Congratulations to Your Excellency Dr. Amr Talaat! Congratulations to Dr. Sherif Farouk! And to the whole team who have helped make this latest innovation possible.-•       Thank you!",['Icon of SDG 09'],"Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Speeches,Egypt,Press release,Development Effectiveness"

UNDP leadership in the sub-region expressed their commitment in supporting a development paradigm shift from vulnerability and crisis to sustainable development and economic prosperity’.-UNDP’s Horn of Africa Forum is an annual platform that brings together UNDP Resident Representatives from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan to discuss cross-border development planning and cooperation in the region.-The Regional Director of the UNDP Bureau for Africa, Ms Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie noted, “The Horn of Africa (UNDP) Forum is an idea whose time has come. The subregion, straddling Africa and the Middle East, is one of the world's poorest and most stressed regions ; Our job as UNDP, and development practitioners, is not only to understand the challenges but also to grasp the opportunities for building stability and resilience, sustaining peace and ensuring shared prosperity.”-The Horn of Africa (HoA) is a young region, home to over 270 million people, 70% of whom are under the age of 30. The region is not only among the youngest but also the most diverse on the African continent.-The Regional Director of the UNDP Bureau for Arab States, Ms Khalida Bouzar, stressed that, “It is important for countries in the region to learn from each other, including through South-South Cooperation. UNDP’s added value is that of working across the humanitarian, development, and peace eco-systems. And, in that context we are committed to unleash the full spectrum of support from governance, poverty reduction to helping build resilience, promote climate action, and strengthen gender equality which will be critical to help address the underlying causes of fragility in line with UNDP’s new Strategic Plan (2022-2025).”-The establishment of the UNDP Horn of Africa Resident Representatives Forum is expected to help UNDP country offices to share analysis and exchange information on regional dynamics in the Horn and create momentum around actions that can achieve major impact in strategic areas. -Hosting the launch meeting of the Forum, UNDP's Resident Representative for Ethiopia, Mr Turhan Saleh noted, “This is a critical juncture for the Horn of Africa. The sub-region has become a centre of global attention, not least because of its location astride a major trade route but also due to its historical role as a ‘bridge’ between Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The Horn is also facing major development challenges that are often structural in nature, demanding urgent action at-scale across multiple issues and across borders to innovate and deliver durable solutions for the people of the sub-region.”-Over the years, UNDP has complemented the work of regional bodies, such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the African Union and the League of Arab States (LAS), most recently through leading on the development of a joint UN strategy for the Horn of Africa that promotes a new way of working (NWOW). The NWOW poses a strong argument for closer collaboration across the humanitarian-development-peace-security nexus to address complex development challenges.  - - - -###  ###  ###- -UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

Data collected over the past 50 years suggests that temperatures have increased by an average 1°C since the 1960s and that rainfall is subject to high variability between years, seasons and regions. The combined risks of water scarcity and recurrent droughts due to rising temperatures could increase the incidence of food insecurity and prompt population movements in search of natural pastures and water resources, implying that  the pastoral and agro-pastoral activities in the country should adapt to the changing climate.-To strengthen national, regional and Woreda (district) level capacities to adapt to climate change, Ethiopia is implementing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) which categorizes short-term adaptation priorities in the sectors considered most vulnerable to climate change, namely: agriculture, forestry, health, transport, energy, industry, water and urban. Ethiopia is working to integrate climate information into planning and decision-making for development interventions, and prioritizing climate resilience across policies. Its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) submitted in July 2021 also outlines adaptation commitments focused on the agriculture and land use sectors, with a priorities identified in livestock diversification, drought-resistant animal breeding, rangeland management, crop, and livestock insurance.-Ethiopia has partnered with the FAO and UNDP Scaling up Climate Ambition on Land Use and Agriculture through NDCs and National Adaptation Plans (SCALA) programme (2020-2025), funded by the German International Climate Initiative (IKI), to further support the implementation of its NDC and NAP, focusing on climate action in the agriculture and land use sectors. In early 2022, Ethiopia officially launched the SCALA programme with an inception workshop that brought together key stakeholders from the Ministries, private sector and civil society institutions. The SCALA programme sat down with Negus Lemma, the Director General at the Climate Change and Biodiversity (EPA) and H. E, Wondale Habtamu, the Advisor of the Minister (MoA) in Ethiopia to learn more about the outcomes of the workshop and highlight the programme’s plans for the next five years.- -***-SCALA: What are some of the key adaptation and mitigation priorities in agriculture and land use that have been outlined in your country’s NDC?-Negus Lemma - Director General; Climate Change and Biodiversity (EPA): “First of all, the agriculture and land use sectors in Ethiopia are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their  reliance on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources, as well as their relatively limited adaptive capacity. In 2017, Ethiopia launched a fifteen-year National Adaptation Plan, which entails 18 adaptation options in the main vulnerable sectors. Some of these options are relevant to agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) and aim to improve the agricultural productivity in a climate-smart manner; strengthen sustainable natural resource management through safeguarding watersheds and landscapes; enhance sustainable forest management and improve early warning systems among others.”-SCALA: What are some of the main barriers experienced in achieving these adaptation goals?-H. E, Wondale Habtamu, Advisor of the Minister (MoA): “Climate change is not something we can push aside and ignore. It is a reality, and we need to pull together resources (technical, financial, and innovative technologies), knowledge and experience to cope with the challenges. Unless addressed systematically and, through a multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral coordinated effort, climate change could negatively impact the country’s progress to transform. Therefore, these resources and coordination related challenges need to be addressed.”-Further discussions at the SCALA inception workshop in Ethiopia highlighted the need to build institutional and technical capacities to implement and scale up climate action. Additionally,  there is a need to strengthen Monitoring, Reporting, Verification and Evaluation (MRV and M&E) by enhancing institutional arrangement. This will require adequate infrastructure and human resources for tracking the progress of climate adaptation and mitigation actions.-SCALA: Ethiopia is part of the 5-year SCALA programme.  How can SCALA support the country in these efforts?-H. E, Wondale Habtamu, Advisor of the Minister (MoA): “I understand that the SCALA Programme is purposively designed to ensure sustainability in our climate response through supporting the implementation of the Climate-Resilient Green Economy (GRGE) transformative climate actions in the land use and agriculture sectors to reduce emissions and enhance adaptive capacity while enhancing collaboration between the public and private sectors as main drivers for implementation of those climate actions.”-The SCALA programme will support an integrated approach to NDC, NAP and CRGE implementation by enhancing national and sub-national capacity to plan, budget, track progress and mobilize finance for climate action in land use and agriculture sectors, particularly through community-based participatory watershed management. The programme can therefore support Ethiopia in its efforts of integrated natural resources management and related activities within the watershed system to enable improved irrigation, as well as small ruminants’ production. Small ruminant systems are particularly important because they will rehabilitate and protect pasturelands to improve feed availability and promote business in the production of small ruminants. Small ruminants have triple economic purposes, such as meat, milk and skin/hide and this will enhance nutrient security and create jobs.-***-The SCALA programme has a strong emphasis on transformative climate actions in the land use and agriculture to reduce GHG emissions and enhance removals, as well as strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change impacts in Ethiopia. Its specific objective is to support the country to translate its NDC, NAP and national climate resilience strategy into community-based watershed management through participatory methods, particularly through strong collaboration amongst federal and regional government bodies, civil society, academia and the private sector.","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 15  Life on land,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,News,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Ethiopia,Climate change,In the news,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,FAO,Goal 13  Climate action,UN Agencies,Mitigation,UNDP,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

He quoted from the closing remark of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme to the 1972 World Summit on the Human Environment, who had said, 'Our Future is Common. We must share. We Must Shape it Together'. -On Behalf of the UN Regional Coordinator, Mrs Worknesh Mekonnen highlighted various development initiatives on which the UN agencies, especially the UNDP, have supported Ethiopia. She noted that the Stockholm+50 Summit was designed to help accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals during the Decade of Action, including through a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. -During the two-day meeting, presentations were made on the national and sector themes. Mr Muluneh Gebremariam from EPA made a presentation on Ethiopia’s climate compatible development journey, including the updated NDC. He said that the country would continue to be heavily impacted by the effects of climate change and the cost of inaction is very high unless we act in a coordinated manner. Ethiopia was said to have heavily invested in climate change actions. Over the last ten years, Ethiopia has invested around 600 Billion Ethiopia Birr. NDC requires over US$316 Billion in both adaptation and mitigation, of which 80% is conditional and is expected to be externally funded by donors.-Other presentations include: National Responses to the Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) in Ethiopia by Mr Mensur from EPA; Landscape Restoration and Livelihood Improvement for Building Social-ecological Resilience by Dr. Adefires from UNDP; the implementation of CBD objectives in Ethiopia by Dr. Melese Maryo from EBI; Meaningful  Youth Engagement on Environment and Climate in Ethiopia by Mr. Yared Abera, a youth representative; National Implementation Plan and Ethiopia’s effort to reduce and eliminate Persistent organic pollutant (POPs) by Mr. Girma Gemechu from EPA; Pesticide management and efforts to dispose stockpile to avoid legacy HHPs by Dr. Mesfin Redi from Addis Ababa University; Generating knowledge and communicating the evidence base to influence policy , practitioners and decision-makers by Mr. Yitatek Kelemu from Policy Studies institute; impacts of environmental and climate change disaster on women by Mrs. Mastewal Habtamu from Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association. -Presenters highlighted how Ethiopia's green legacy initiative inspired millions of people to think of addressing land degradation and restoring degraded land all over Ethiopia, including how community participation has contributed to biodiversity conservation in situ. Ethiopia was said to have reduced the average annual rate of deforestation from 92,000 ha to 33,000 ha. -Presenters also indicated how pollution and other environmental problems are posing development challenges, stressing the need for the active participation of all stakeholders in environmental actions. They also underlined that youth and women participation is crucial in environmental governance and needs to be supported by policies and strategies, including institutionalizing the efforts from the current voluntary engagement. -During the discussions, participants stressed that the issue of environment and biodiversity conservation is not a one-sector issue and that collaboration between sectors and different stakeholders is crucial. -Developed countries' financial and technical support was said to be crucial for the implementation of multifaceted environmental and climate actions. Development partners also play a role in mobilizing resources for investments in climate actions in developing countries. -Ethiopia's national consultation will continue with virtual and in-person meetings until the end of May 2022.

The situation jeopardizes the safety of all Ukrainians and, as with other conflicts in other parts of the world, puts women and girls in particular at increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence, especially those who are refugees or otherwise displaced from their homes. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has joined the UN-system wide response to support those affected by the conflict, both inside Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries receiving refugees.  In Ukraine, as with many other crisis and conflict contexts, from Afghanistan and the Sahel to Myanmar and Yemen -- increasing the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women in peacemaking, conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts is crucial to find lasting solutions.-This approach also holds true when it comes to tackling climate change and environmental degradation; and boosting disaster risk reduction -- the theme of this year’s Commission on the Status of Women. Women play a crucial role in the climate and environmental sectors, and they are often leading frontline natural resource management strategies. This makes them well-placed to identify and implement effective and sustainable solutions. Yet environmental degradation and increased competition over scarce resources are exacerbating the risk of gender-based violence while women environmental human rights defenders, including indigenous women, often face threats and violence. UNDP and the University of Pittsburgh’s Global Report on Gender Equality in Public Administration shows that even though women are disproportionately impacted by the climate and environmental crises, they are still hitting a glass ceiling that stops them from advancing to the highest levels of leadership in environmental protection and climate action. Women’s participation in ministries of environmental protection averages 33% globally, for instance, and parity in decision-making on these critical issues is exceptionally rare.-Yet change is possible. UNDP’s Climate Promise is currently assisting 120 countries to enhance their climate pledges, known as National Determined Contributions (NDCs). These NDCs are important vehicles for advancing not only sustainable development but also gender equality. Globally, over 110,000 people have engaged in NDC stakeholder consultations and women are leading the process in many cases. 96% of second-generation NDCs supported under the Climate Promise include references to gender compared to 48% of first-generation NDCs. Or look to the Feminist Action for Climate Justice Action Coalition, co-led by UNDP and a consortium of partners. It aims to accelerate progress on climate justice and gender equality over the next five years. We need to build on such efforts to advance more ambitious gender-responsive environmental and climate agendas. In particular, they must take the unique needs and perspectives of women into account and actively promote women’s participation and leadership. They must also make climate and environmental finance work for women. Driving forward this change can have a ripple effect.

It is also found out that most of the vision problems are rudimentary refractive errors, treatment of which requires only limited skills and knowledge, and improved pair of eyeglasses.-UNDP Ethiopia benefitted from two rounds of challenge fund which financed four Czech companies and local partners including DOT Glasses to test their solutions to solve vision problem in Ethiopia. The Accelerator  Lab identified priority areas for the challenge fund, participated in the evaluation of applications, and most importantly created grassroot connections for selected solutions with relevant stake holders in Ethiopia for successful implementation of the pilot projects and scale-up.-The implementation of Challenge Fund projects is financially supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. Prior to the start of the project, an initial DOT pilot testing made sure that the final price of glasses is accessible to Ethiopians. DOT also identified 150 locals who agreed to join the project and become Ethiopia’s first DOT Glasses distributors. The way forward was to use the Czech-UNDP’s funding to train local distributors to use the DOT Glasses kits and assemble glasses. Such training took several days. Finally, 141 participants completed the training and became micro-entrepreneurs, able to approach customers. Ultimately, the funding helped to purchase the Vision kits and two months’ worth of replenishments for project’s local distributors. By involving locals to participate in the distribution, DOT’s solution looked further than just delivering a few sets of glasses.-The solution therefore targeted not only the people who need glasses but also provides an economic opportunity for local distributors trained within the project. Priced at around 6-7 USD, the glasses are significantly more affordable than alternatives, yet they still provide an economic motivation for distributors which strengthens project’s sustainability. The margin for the entrepreneur is between 2-3 USD. Aware of the local conditions, the DOT also entered negotiations with local authorities with the goal of securing additional funding for those still not able to afford the product.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Innovation,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,In the news,Development Effectiveness,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,partnerships,News,Ethiopia,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

UNDP leadership in the sub-region expressed their commitment in supporting a development paradigm shift from vulnerability and crisis to sustainable development and economic prosperity’.--UNDP’s Horn of Africa Forum is an annual platform that brings together UNDP Resident Representatives from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan to discuss cross-border development planning and cooperation in the region.-The Regional Director of the UNDP Bureau for Africa, Ms Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie noted, “The Horn of Africa (UNDP) Forum is an idea whose time has come. The subregion, straddling Africa and the Middle East, is one of the world's poorest and most stressed regions ; Our job as UNDP, and development practitioners, is not only to understand the challenges but also to grasp the opportunities for building stability and resilience, sustaining peace and ensuring shared prosperity.”-The Horn of Africa (HoA) is a young region, home to over 270 million people, 70% of whom are under the age of 30. The region is not only among the youngest but also the most diverse on the African continent.-The Regional Director of the UNDP Bureau for Arab States, Ms Khalida Bouzar, stressed that, “It is important for countries in the region to learn from each other, including through South-South Cooperation. UNDP’s added value is that of working across the humanitarian, development, and peace eco-systems. And, in that context we are committed to unleash the full spectrum of support from governance, poverty reduction to helping build resilience, promote climate action, and strengthen gender equality which will be critical to help address the underlying causes of fragility in line with UNDP’s new Strategic Plan (2022-2025).”-The establishment of the UNDP Horn of Africa Resident Representatives Forum is expected to help UNDP country offices to share analysis and exchange information on regional dynamics in the Horn and create momentum around actions that can achieve major impact in strategic areas. --Hosting the launch meeting of the Forum, UNDP's Resident Representative for Ethiopia, Mr Turhan Saleh noted, “This is a critical juncture for the Horn of Africa. The sub-region has become a centre of global attention, not least because of its location astride a major trade route but also due to its historical role as a ‘bridge’ between Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The Horn is also facing major development challenges that are often structural in nature, demanding urgent action at-scale across multiple issues and across borders to innovate and deliver durable solutions for the people of the sub-region.”-Over the years, UNDP has complemented the work of regional bodies, such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the African Union and the League of Arab States (LAS), most recently through leading on the development of a joint UN strategy for the Horn of Africa that promotes a new way of working (NWOW). The NWOW poses a strong argument for closer collaboration across the humanitarian-development-peace-security nexus to address complex development challenges.  - - -###  ###  ###- -UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

As co-chairs, our focus is to sensitize and encourage women to get involved in politics and to vote for their counterparts irrespective of our political differences. We also encourage men to vote for women. Since independence, women  are often used as mobilizers,  cooking and cheering during political engagements. However, since the establishment of  WOBIPC, we have seen some progress towards the inclusion of women in strategic spaces such as political debates and in decision making, a transformation we intend to keep promoting. The Gambia has a total of 962,157 voters, including 545,318 women (56.68%) and 416,839 men (43.32%). The percentage of young (18-35) voters stands at 57.71% (555220), highlighting the importance of these two demographic groups in deciding the outcome of the presidential election. Before the The Gambia 2022 National Assembly elections, we went on a nation-wide tour to sensitize and encourage citizens to vote for women, inform them of its importance and highlighting that women are key actors for development. An increased representation of women in Parliament will contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Moving forward and in collaboration with the IPC and partners, we intend to continue the advocacy during elections and beyond for people to understand the seriousness and value of women leadership. Key decision-making positions in political parties are usually given to men but we are calling out on all party leaders and members as well as CSOs leaders, community leaders and influencers to consider women and give them key leadership positions.

As research-cum-educational establishments, universities have been the citadel of learning, knowledge production and dissemination on improved development programs and practices worldwide. In cognizance of this, on October 12, 2020, UNDP signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the University of The Gambia (UTG) in mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in its academic curricular, research programs and community engagement.-This partnership, which is currently advanced by UNDP Accelerator Lab The Gambia (AcclabGM), equally aims to support the country’s overall reform process in the social, economic, political and security spheres, as embedded in The Gambia’s National Development Plan (NDP 2018-2021). In line with national priorities, the MOU captures five thematic areas:-i)                   SDG tracking:-This aspect of the MOU is necessitated by the fact that substantive qualitative and quantitative research output is crucial for sustainable development planning and practice. Against this backdrop and as a lead research institution in The Gambia, UTG will conduct research to track, monitor, and evaluate the progress of the implementation of the SDGs in The Gambia. This also includes enhancing data and statistics for development within the National Statistical System of The Gambia. Broadly speaking, such research interventions would be invaluable in informing government policy decisions and UNDP programs in the country.-ii)                 Curriculum Development-Under this pillar, the MOU seeks to mainstream the SDGs in the university’s academic curricular as a way of providing familiarity and learning opportunities to students in the areas of sustainable development. In other words, this approach is geared towards preparing young people in becoming progressive development planners, analysts and practitioners. To achieve this goal, the different Schools at UTG will develop curricula on thematic areas of the SDGs as part of classroom lectures/discussions and seminars. Notwithstanding, the SDG curricula will be used to train and enhance the capacities of Gambians and other nationalities domiciled in the country.- -iii)               Case study and research on SDG baseline information-Studies on The Gambia have increasingly revealed the gaps on baseline information in many areas of development – water quality, rural poverty, agriculture etc. This is where UTG will come in and fill that gap on baseline information by conducting case studies and research. Essentially, having such baseline information will enable us to assess progress, identify challenges, and set realistic benchmarks towards attaining the SDGs. This will equally serve as a guide to development stakeholders, partners and donors.- -iv)                SDG Lecture Series-In their quest to reach out to the larger population of The Gambia, UNDP Gambia and UTG will organize various seminars, conferences, and workshops throughout The Gambia informing and educating the Gambian population on the SDGs. Considering the high illiteracy rate in country, especially in rural areas, this sensitization project will particularly target rural people – farmers, women, girls and youths using local languages and methods. This engagement seeks to avail local populations the opportunities to further understand and relate with the SDGs and as well adopt sustainable practices that enhance their daily socio-economic activities.- -v)                  Project Piloting-Considering the AcclabGM project will phase out in 2022 and as part of the gradual phasing out, AcclabGM by extension of UNDP will support and co-host activities with UTG that strengthen its standing as the likely national partner to which UNDP would hand over the Lab framework. This move is in line with the understanding that the nature of project, in terms of research, experimentation and solutions mapping, predominantly aligns with the mandate and interventions of the university.-Notably, in this strategic partnership, each of the nine Schools within UTG will focus on a specific SDG or SDGs that aligns with its mandate to design innovative projects that respond to the pressing development needs of The Gambia. For instance, the School of Arts and Sciences, precisely the Development Studies Unit, will incorporate and focus on SDG 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender Equality) and related Goals in its lecture/seminar series and research programs. While the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences will direct teaching and research on SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) amongst other associated Goals. On the other hand, UNDP will aid in the mobilization of financial resources and as well provide the requisite technical support.-As we are nearing the end of 2020, this partnership has put in motion fascinating projects around girls and women empowerment, implementation of the gender seal, (rural) community development, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), youth entrepreneurship amongst others for implementation in early 2021. The upcoming launching of the Center for Sustainable Development and Policy Studies (CSPS) at UTG is key among these initiatives. CSPS will be home to academic research, public policy evaluation and development and rapid rural development in The Gambia.-Overall, this partnership is shaped by the understanding that local ownership of the SDGs is integral to their success. Moreover, the complex development challenges of our time signal the need for concerted efforts and (new) cooperation from different stakeholders at all fronts (local, national and global) for successful development interventions. Importantly, synergizing international and local initiatives/efforts is imperative towards the realization of the SDGs by 2030. The UNDP-UTG partnership is a move in the right direction!- - - - - ",[],"SDG Deep Dive Series,News,Sustainable development,UNDP,English"

Our aim at Plastic Punch is to continue to work with all partners to raise awareness among citizens on the dangers of marine pollution and how we can contribute to saving and protecting our marine resources and livelihoods since we all depend on the oceans for survival”.-The aim of the beach clean-up exercise is to leverage volunteerism and mass action to reduce the amount of plastic waste going into the oceans whilst raising awareness on the need for sustainable consumption, production, and proper waste management practices in communities towards a sustainable future for all. This is because, the waste that end up in the oceans largely come from improper waste management from inlands.-“With no time to waste, we must re-evaluate our roles in reversing environmental degradation that puts our health, prosperity, peace, and planet at risk. We are taking a step toward revitalizing our oceans, and every citizen, institution, and stakeholder group has a part to play. Let’s all come together to promote environmental stewardship by changing our consumption and production habits”, noted Angela Lusigi, UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana.-The UNDP Resident Representative added that, UNDP will continue to support innovation and work with public and private partners across Ghana’s vibrant innovation ecosystem to expand opportunities for young innovators who are working to keep the oceans healthy.  So far, UNDP, she noted, has provided about $400,000 grants to 11 companies that are promoting waste recovery, creating jobs and livelihoods.-The EU Ambassador to Ghana, Irchad Razaaly noted that “improved waste and wastewater management, increased recycling, avoidance of single-use products and product eco-design can efficiently prevent marine litter. To drastically reduce plastic pollution, intensive education and awareness raising is needed, together with resolute policies on plastic reduction and recycling. Some private companies are invested into circular economy to increase profits and create more jobs, and a conducive regulatory framework would scale-up and increase these investments.”-The 2022 beach clean-up exercise organized by Plastic Punch, UNDP and the EU in Ghana mobilized over 250 citizens comprising staff of these organizations, school children, and community volunteers to take action to save the oceans for people and for the planet. Innovators, who are members of the UNDP facilitated Waste Recovery Platform were also involved in the exercise and collected some of the various waste sorted for recycling. This is to complement efforts by Plastic Punch over the years, in leading the charge to protect and revitalize the ocean and everything it sustains through beach cleanup exercises.-World Ocean Day is an annual event marked on June 8 to inform the public of the impact of human actions on the ocean. The day is celebrated worldwide to mobilize and unite citizens to take action for the sustainable management of the world's oceans.- -###-For more information and media enquiries contact:

Yet, deforestation and forest degradation continue to threaten the global forest cover and the livelihoods of many people.-In Ghana’s Eastern Region, Akyem Abuakwa, which is one of the country’s high forest areas, has experienced some of the highest levels of deforestation. About 30% of the region’s forest loss is attributable to socio-economic activities such as illegal timber logging, mining, expansion in agricultural land use and bad agricultural practices, wildfires, and unsecured land and tree tenure arrangements.-The impact of deforestation and degradation is believed to be closely linked to other human development challenges. To provide sustainable solutions to these interconnected challenges and accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations in Ghana with funding from the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security is implementing a project titled: Fostering Reforestation, Environmental Sustainability and Tourism in the Okyeman Area (FOREST Okyeman).-This project is particularly significant as it is adopting human security and community-based approaches towards promoting sustainable livelihoods and wellbeing of the people by strengthening local systems to address critical gaps in environmental, health and education response in Akyem Abuakwa.-It is worth noting that, the FOREST Okyeman is also a clear manifestation of how multi-stakeholder collaboration can be leveraged to co-create solutions for sustainable development challenges, as it is being implemented by Traditional authorities and communities in the area in collaboration with UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, UNEP, UNV and the Okyeman Environment Foundation as well as government, and private sector actors.-The Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP in Ghana, Sukhrob Khoshmukhamedov reiterates the uniqueness of the FOREST Okyeman partnership when he stated at the project’s inception meeting that “the environmental and socio-economic challenges facing communities today are enormous. We must continue to leverage strategic partnerships to empower communities to build their resilience and advance respect for human rights and dignity”.- -Indeed, the role of traditional authorities in all efforts to protect the forest and build sustainable livelihoods cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, it is significant that the project emphasizes local ownership, with strong support by the traditional authorities in Akyem Abuakwa led by the Okyenhene, His Royal Majesty, Osagyefo Amoatia Oforipanin. As the custodians of the lands, the special role of chiefs will be critical in mobilizing communities to support the project implementation and facilitate sustainability.-As the Asomkahene & Kyebi Kyidom Panin, Barima Fredua Agyeman Okotomin rightly said during the inception meeting of the project, ""the forest has a huge potential waiting to be tapped. As communities and traditional leaders, we must work towards protecting it for the long-term socio-economic benefits"".- - -The FOREST Okyeman project will promote considerable investments in reforestation program hinged on sustainable environmental governance and management, ecotourism, livelihoods empowerment, and the promotion of better health and education outcomes.-It is being implemented over 3 years and is expected to benefit over 1.3 million beneficiaries (671,921 women and 505,907 children between the ages of 0-14 years) spanning across 5 districts in the Eastern Region.-As the threats to the environment continue to widen, sustaining livelihoods and the wellbeing of people require actions at all levels. Leveraging the influence of traditional leaders in this agenda as being done in the FOREST Okyeman project is the most effective way to drive communities towards sustainable practices for people and for planet.","['Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Goal 15  Life on land,UNICEF,Goal 13  Climate action,UN Volunteers,Ghana,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,UNEP,WHO,News,English"

These contribute towards fiscal revenue, income, job creation and poverty reduction.-In Ghana, over the past years, extraction of natural resources such as cocoa, gold, and oil among others has helped transform Ghana’s economic growth, with revenue contribution valued at 67% of exports and 15.4% of GDP. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, overtime analysis of trends in Ghana’s natural resources governance performance reveals some deficits and gaps.-As part of efforts to contribute to Ghana’s efforts to enhance natural resource governance, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) organized a dialogue to examine Ghana’s progress in its efforts towards good natural resource governance and explore policy options to address existing and emerging deficits to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).-Addressing the dialogue on the theme “Gaps in natural resource governance: spaces for accountability and transparency”, the UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana, Angela Lusigi, called for stronger collaboration among stakeholders to drive a transformational change and co-create together the future of governance needed for sustainable development.-“At UNDP, we believe that there are opportunities for us to work together to consolidate gains and take bold and decisive steps in the area of governance to ensure that Ghana’s wealth of natural resources become true national assets; benefiting all.”-The Keynote Speaker at the maiden Future of Governance Series, Professor Abdul-Gafaru Abdulai, an Associate Professor in the Department of Public Administration at the University of Ghana Business School, applauded Ghana for the substantial progress in the governance of the extractives sector, particularly relating to legislations and value realizations. He noted that Ghana’s gold mining sector scored 69% in the 2021 resource governance index, which is an improvement of 13 points from the 2017 score.-He however highlighted key challenges that need to be addressed to improve natural resource governance in Ghana.  Among the key deficits he cited is the issue of contract disclosures where there is currently no legislation or policy to make contract disclosure compulsory. He also mentioned inefficient open data system, revenue management issues and challenges with artisanal small-scale mining particularly issues of environmental degradation.-Moreover, he added that, despite Ghana being signatory to the international protocol on Free Prior Inform Consent (FPIC), which makes it important for the local people to agree to any extraction that takes place in their jurisdiction, the final consent must be given by the sector minister which sometimes limit citizens participation in extraction governance. But he commended the transparency in the oil and gas sector, where oil blocks are awarded through an open and competitive bidding process but stressed on the need for more accountability.-Professor Abdul-Gafaru Abdulai, in his presentation, recommended investment in geological data and open data system, particularly in the mining sector which will be beneficial to the mining industry, land-use planners and environmental scientists. He also suggested the need to explore opportunities to formalize the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) operators through innovative financing solutions.  -He further recommended the inclusion of mandatory contract disclosure in the mining sector, the need for a more transparent, accountable, and productive use of mining revenues by subnational authorities, as well as greater citizens participation.-A Project Coordinator at CARE International, Mr. Zakaria Yakubu highlighted the need to evaluate the relevance of Ghana’s Natural Resources and Environmental Governance Programme (NREG) to enhance effective coordination between agencies in the resource sector.-“It is my hope that, the NREG initiative would be evaluated and implemented to provide annual sector budgetary support to the natural resource sector and also enable coordination between the various agencies to ensure that important key policies that need to be put in place are addressed”, he stated.-The Future of Governance dialogue series seeks to create a platform for critical analysis and engagements with national stakeholders with interest and mandate in governance to explore innovative and sustainable alternative solutions towards good governance.

Since then, the pandemic has caused significant impact on health systems around the world, disrupting all aspects of human life including the delivery of routine health services.-As part of Ghana’s recovery efforts, it has therefore become necessary to support the continuity of essential health services to address health issues like malaria, AIDS, tuberculosis, and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). This is to facilitate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 on Good Health and Wellbeing by 2030.-In this regard, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service, with funding from the Government of Japan, has been implementing a series of interventions to strengthen health systems at the community level for improved health outcomes.-The project dubbed: ‘Strengthening Community Health System to Support the Continuity of Essential Services for the Vulnerable during and post COVID-19 Pandemic’ is strengthening the capacity of health facilities and Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) in underserved urban communities to provide health services.-To underscore the importance of CHPS in healthcare delivery, it is worth repeating the profound words of the Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP in Ghana, Sukhrob Khoshmukhamedov, when he said “for us to achieve universal health coverage and SDG 3, we must bring healthcare services to the doorstep of communities. This is a pragmatic strategy that can promote access and equity in health service provision”.-Speaking at the handing over ceremony of a fully equipped CHPS facility at Chorkor Chemuena as part of the project, the Japanese Ambassador to Ghana, H.E. MOCHIZUKI Hisanobu highlighted the need for sustainable healthcare initiatives to overcome health challenges.-“COVID-19 has placed a heavy burden on health systems and consequently affected the delivery of essential health services. We must strengthen health systems by building the capacity of health facilities to respond to health emergencies”, added H.E. MOCHIZUKI Hisanobu.-This project is significant in several ways. It is bringing health service delivery to the doorsteps of the most vulnerable in society and helping to ensure that no one is left behind. Moreover, it is simultaneously enhancing the capacities of community health systems, communities, vulnerable groups such as women, children, persons living with HIV, persons living with non-communicable diseases and slum dwellers for the uptake of health services during and post COVID-19 pandemic.-Moreover, thanks to the project interventions, 100 community health management committee members, community health volunteers and community health officers in the Ga Central Municipality and the Accra Metropolis in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana have gained the requisite knowledge and skills to strengthen essential health service provision.-In addition, through series of engagements with community members, over 200 community leaders, including women leaders are now aware of the available services within their communities and are poised to support other community members to take full advantage.-“I am particularly very happy for the pregnant women and children in this community. Previously we used to struggle to go to Korle Bu Polyclinic, but now with this CHPS compound, pregnant women will not have to struggle to access quality healthcare”, noted Naa Adokor Gyamfi, Queen Mother of Chorkor.-Indeed, 22 CHPS zones in Accra Metropolis and Ga Central Municipality are benefitting from the project, with Chorkor Chemuena receiving a fully equipped CHPS compound and Anyaa receiving a patient care block in Anyaa Polyclinic, whilst the other zones have received over 60 essential medical and operational equipment including weighing and height scale, adult and pediatric stethoscope, digital blood pressure apparatus, refrigerator thermometer, motorbikes and tricycles, and tablets.-To facilitate effective health surveillance in the era of COVID, especially at the borders of Ghana, the project is also providing mobile laboratories at Aflao, Elubo, Kotoka International Airport, and Paga points of entries to strengthen case detection and management for COVID-19 and future public health emergencies.-It is worth noting that if the pandemic has taught the world any lesson, it is that leaving others behind in the access to quality healthcare services is a potent threat to the health of all. This is better summarized in the powerful words of the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, when she stated, “No one will ever be truly safe until everyone is safe.”  -Therefore, the time to build strong community health systems that truly work for all is now or never.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Coronavirus COVID-19,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Ghana,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Governance and peacebuilding,News,Sustainable development,English"

These increasing complexities and drivers require a robust approach to tacking the trend.-The United Nations (UN) Plan of Action to Prevent Extremism recognizes the inclusion of women, youth and communities in strategic approaches as vital to the success of the  measures against extremism and conflict.-As a result, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), with support from the governments of Netherlands and Sweden, has been mobilizing stakeholders such as youth and women groups, traditional authorities, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and state institutions at the local level, especially in border communities to support efforts towards preventing violent extremism and conflicts through training and engagements.-One of such groups who have heeded to the clarion call of UNDP and partners is the Green Youth Association of Kajelo in the Upper West Region of Ghana.-The group is leveraging the training they had from UNDP to engage stakeholders over clashes between a local community and Fulbe herders. The dialogue sessions have expanded to include the paramount chief of the Paga traditional area who has lent his support to resolve the clashes between herders and the local communities in his traditional area.-“After participating in the sensitization on peacebuilding and preventing violent extremism, organized by UNDP, we realized that some of the strategies we learnt could be deployed to help solve the longstanding conflict between the herders and community members in the Paga Traditional area. This led us to replicating the engagements in the community’’, said Pwasam Frederick, the President of Green Youth Association of Kajelo.-These series of engagements which are aimed at promoting co-existence between the local people and the Fulbe people is already yielding results and contributing to peaceful co-existence among people in the area.-The feuding factions have resolved to deepen engagements and promote non-violent ways of settling disputes. As a result, the Fulbe herders have elected a leader to facilitate their continuous dialogue with the community to prevent further clashes.-“We have demonstrated through this engagement that dialogue is the only way we can achieve peace. Therefore, we must support our leaders so that together we can work to coexist with each other peacefully”, noted Pe Charles Awiah Awampaga II, Paramount Chief of the Paga Traditional Area,-The success chalked by the Green Youth Association of Kajelo in promoting non-violent ways of handling grievances is not only an indication that dialogue is best approach towards sustainable peace, but it also reinforces the role young people can play in promoting peace and harmony among communities.",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Ghana,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Governance and peacebuilding,News,English"

Under her leadership, City Waste Recycling now recycles plastic waste, contributing to reduce the plastic waste menace in the country. With the zeal to grow, City Waste applied for the second edition of the Waste Recovery Innovation Challenge, which was organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF), under the Ghana Waste Recovery Platform. Thankfully, City Waste was one of the winners of the challenge and the seed money, according to Vivian, was used to transform the business.-“The support from UNDP and the Coca Cola Foundation was very timely. We received the funds at a time that we needed to scale up the business. So, the fund was used to purchase very critical equipment such as an agglomerator, granulator, crushing machine and mold”, Vivian disclosed.- -A Delightful Journey-City Waste Recycling has been in operation since 2018. In the early days of the company, it was mainly producing briquettes from sawdust, with the aim of helping to reduce the release of harmful chemicals that go into the atmosphere when people burn sawdust.  -After some years of producing briquettes from sawdust, the company saw a business opportunity in the growing plastic waste pollution and decided to find innovative solutions to turn plastic and other waste into useful products.-“When I realized a lot can be done with plastic waste, I decided to venture into that sector. The journey so far has been amazing and with thanks to UNDP and other partners, the business has been running smoothly,” Vivian narrated.-Today, City Waste Recycling produces plastic pellets and sell to other companies for reuse. The company is also into electronic waste recycling and scrap fridge degassing (removal of oil and gas from the cooling system of a scrap refrigerator without spilling anything into the environment) for re-use.-“This journey has been a fulfilling one for me and the company. Now, we are not only helping to keep our environment and planet safe, but we are also improving the livelihoods of a lot of people”, noted Vivian.- -Partnership Opportunity-In 2021, UNDP in partnership with the Coca Cola Foundation and the Ghana National Plastic Action Partnership (GNAP) organized the Ghana Waste Fair. The Fair brought together actors in the waste management value chain, like City Waste, to network and share ideas to promote sustainable waste management and circular economy in Ghana.-“The Ghana Waste Fair was a door opener and a game changer for our business. The fair connected us to two big investors. I signed two big deals on both the electronic waste and plastic waste initiatives thanks to the fair”, Vivian noted.- -Today, Vivian’s determination and leadership has made City Waste a thriving business, reducing plastic pollution, contributing to climate action and livelihoods improvement for many. Thanks to the support from UNDP and other partners, the company now recycles 500 metric tons per day, an increase from 200 metric tons of plastic per day that it used to recycle before getting the 40,000 US dollar grant from the Waste Recovery Challenge. City Waste also now employs about 600 people of which 538 of them are temporary staff and 62 of them are permanent staff.- -Ghana produces about 1.1 million tons of plastic waste produce per year and the remarkable leadership provided by Vivian is yet another testament of how women can be supported to lead the charge in the race against time to protect the environment and planet.",['Icon of SDG 12'],"Africa,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,Ghana,News,English"

For example, out of Ghana’s 275 members of parliament (MPs), there are only 40 women representing about 16%. Similarly, only 18 women are appointed as Ministers out of the 86 current ministerial positions, representing about 21%. The situation is not different at the local government level, where out of the current 261 Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs), only 38 are women, with the remaining 223 being men. Though these statistics suggest some progress made from previous years, there is still more work to be done to bridge the gender inequality gap.-Besides women, youth representation in political institutions, policy-making and decision-making processes has remained limited in Ghana; despite the country being touted as a youthful nation, with the youth constituting about 37% of the population.-“My community elders had a meeting with me to step down as an Assemblywoman aspirant to allow a man in the community to contest unopposed. Their reason was simply because I am a woman and must not challenge a male-aspirant who was contesting with me in the community because this is disrespectful. I had to step down because I had no support. But I will stand again”, said Agnes Akanwake in the Kassena Nankana West District Assembly in the Upper East Region of Ghana. - -Agnes was among a group of women and youth engaged at leadership and advocacy capacity development sessions organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for selected district and municipal assemblies to promote inclusive recovery from COVID-19. During the sessions, the women and youth noted challenges confronting them in their bids to take up leadership positions.-Lack of confidence, social norms such as cultural and religious beliefs, absence of support from men and society, intimidation, harassment, name tagging, and lack of funds are some of the challenges cited by the women participants as factors preventing them from exercising their civil responsibility to take up political leadership positions. For the youth, age is mainly an inhibiting factor.-Despite the legal and constitutional provisions which clearly state that a person shall not be discriminated against on any ground such as gender, race, colour, ethnic origin, religion, creed or social or economic status, the story of Gladys and Agnes, and other women who aspire for leadership and political positions in Ghana seems to be improving at a rather slow pace.-For women and youth to effectively engage in development and recovery efforts for pandemics such as COVID-19; society must respect their rights and they need to have the right capacities to articulate their issues and concerns. In this regard, about 250 women and youth participants in five selected districts where UNDP has been providing COVID-19 recovery support to the local assemblies, are benefiting from the leadership and advocacy training. The selected districts are Sagnarigu, Ketu South, Kasena Nankana West, Sefwi Wiawso and Jomoro. The participants including assembly women and aspirants, representatives of queen mothers, youth groups, and other relevant community leaders/ members involving persons with disability are being engaged in useful lessons and discussions to identify structural barriers and co-create solutions to address the gender equality barriers.-“We still have men who get intimidated with the success of their wives or women in general. So, sensitization efforts must also target men to break down the gender barriers. The good thing in supporting women is that they get the opportunity to support development efforts which benefit everyone including men and children”, noted Desmond Abire, Assembly Member, Kassena Nankana West District.- -The women want to see more sensitizations targeting men, traditional rulers, and opinion leaders to contribute to efforts to break down the cultural and religious barriers inhibiting gender equality at the grassroots. Funding support for women aspiring for political leadership positions, and honoring men and communities that support the political leadership of women, they stated, will also help in closing the gender inequality gap.-For Sherifa Bawah, who leads a women group in Paga at the Kassena Nankana West District, it would also be helpful if women build their confidence level, as this would help overcome the odds.-“My advice to my fellow women is that they should ignore the criticism and discouragements and remain focused on what they want to do to help society”.- -Empowering women and girls advances social inclusion, economic growth, and development. It is therefore important to end all forms of discrimination against women, girls, and youth to ensure a sustainable future for all.

GEORGETOWN, 17 DECEMBER 2021 – The United Nations Development Programme today, officially launched the 7th Operational Phase of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP) in Guyana. The launch was held virtually, with a limited number of stakeholders in attendance at UN House. Attendees included stakeholders from the public and private sector, diplomatic corps, civil society and academia. The 7th Operational Phase (OP7) of the SGP, aims to “promote and support innovative, inclusive and scalable initiatives, and foster multi-stakeholder partnerships at the local level to tackle global environmental issues in priority landscapes and seascapes”.-The GEF SGP complements the work of the Government of Guyana by creating a funding platform that contributes positively to key developmental goals. This is accomplished through the direct engagement of grassroots organisations and local communities in decision making for the creation of sustainable environmental solutions that enhance their well-being and livelihoods.  The GEF SGP has been active in Guyana since 2013 and invested more than USD 941,000 in 24 projects with more than USD 925,000 in cash and in-kind co-financing. The projects’ geographic coverage includes seven of the ten administrative regions (1 to 6 & 9). Under OP7, a total of USD 500,000 has been earmarked for SGP Guyana to implement environmental-based projects.-
During his remarks, Mr. Jairo Valverde, the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme posited that the “SGP embodies the essence of sustainable development through our approach of thinking globally, acting locally, and has the comparative advantage of working with community groups for innovative, impactful, inclusive projects and initiatives which enhance the well-being and livelihoods of people including women, indigenous people and youth”. Mr Valverde affirmed that Operational Phase 7 is SGP Guyana’s third funding phase, and OP 7 targeted projects will be community-driven initiatives implemented through active partnerships with local organisations and indigenous groups”.-The feature address was delivered by Ms. Sharifah Razack, Deputy Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency and representative of the GEF Operational Focal Point. Ms. Razack outlined the guiding principle that governs the initiatives supported by the SGP, which is, they are spearheaded by communities. This Ms. Razack said creates a sense of ownership. Additionally, the communities implement their projects under the guidance of the SGP which creates the conditions for knowledge transfer and building competence. Before closing, the Deputy Executive Director reaffirmed the EPA’s commitment to ensuring that the funded projects meet the objectives of Operational Phase 7, which will be assured through the EPA’s resuscitation of the GEF National Working Group.-

 GEORGETOWN, 9 AUGUST 2021 – Each year, on August 9, the United Nations (UN) celebrates the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. The date marks the first meeting of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations. Recognizing the multiple and intersecting challenges faced by indigenous peoples across the world, this year’s theme “Leaving no one behind: Indigenous peoples and the call for a new social contract” encourages us to include, involve and integrate indigenous people at all levels, to protect their rights, and to obtain free, prior, and informed consent.-The history of most indigenous peoples around the world is marked by colonisation, which led to the loss of their autonomy over their territories and natural resources. Indigenous peoples have often been marginalised, excluded from participation in society, cast as poor and uneducated, and forced to accept fate as voiceless observers of the destruction of their sacred lands and waters.-
Indigenous societies have preserved, for generations, highly sophisticated knowledge of the natural world and have reconciled this with their culture, spirituality, and cosmovision of their place in the ecosystem of life. Their culture is often characterised by a harmonious, symbiotic relationship between humans and nature, making life meaningful and pleasurable. Such indigenous ability to share and transfer unique local knowledge from the older to the younger generations, to sustainably use and manage natural resources for the common good of the community is now being called for and recognised by researchers, climate scientists, and relevant international bodies as one of the best solutions to combat climate change, while restoring and protecting biodiversity.
-The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed and exacerbated many existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting indigenous populations which were already at a higher risk of poverty, illness, discrimination, and difficulties in securing livelihoods.-Many UN agencies and inter-governmental bodies, in cooperation with local, national, regional, and international stakeholders, are increasingly creating opportunities to engage indigenous peoples in problem-solving, decision-making, and knowledge-sharing to address global challenges such as biodiversity conservation and climate change. Such efforts are producing impactful actions and results within several international initiatives, such as the Inter-governmental Science Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services (IPBES), the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples’ Platform (LCIPP), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).-Since 1992, UNESCO’s programme on Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LINKS) has promoted the importance of indigenous knowledge in the UN system, among policymakers, governments, academia, and in research, and creates opportunities for exchange with indigenous peoples.  As such, Caribbean indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as experts from meteorological and hydrological services, and institutions dealing with climate change from 16 countries, came together for the first Caribbean workshop on indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in Georgetown, Guyana for three days in September 2019 to share their experiences of anticipating and responding to different environmental challenges, including natural disasters and climate change impacts. This enabled the elaboration of a Caribbean-wide overview of how indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) are being used to predict, prepare for and tackle the impacts of climate change, and to consider ways in which ILK, science, and policy-making can better collaborate.",[],"Early warning,UN Agencies,Guyana,Press release,UNDP"

The 2021 Regional Human Development Report “Trapped: High Inequality and Low Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean”, launched virtually today by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), analyzes the trap in which the region is immersed, which prevents progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.-Despite the progress of recent decades, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are more unequal than countries in other regions with similar levels of development, and their social indicators are still below those expected for their average income level.-The report explores critical factors that underlie the mutual reproduction of high inequality and low growth: concentration of power, violence all its forms -political, criminal and social-, and poorly functioning social protection policies.-“The report calls on Latin Americans to understand the connection between all these factors and highlights an entry point that can serve to break free from low growth and high inequality: the implementation of universal social protection systems that are redistributive, fiscally sustainable, and more favorable to growth, ”explains Luis Felipe López Calva, Assistant Administrator and UNDP’s Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean.-The document points out that concentration of power in the hands of a few who defend their private interests is one of the factors that connect high inequality with low growth. Through its political influence, power misuse distorts public policies and weakens institutions. One example explored in the report is the role of economic elites in blocking fiscal reforms that would support a more progressive form of redistribution. To balance the distribution of power, UNDP suggests exploring lines of action such as lobbying regulation and financing of political campaigns.-It also points out that the region is the most violent on the planet, and warns that although inequality causes greater violence, violence also increases inequality because it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, contributing to perpetuate their state of deprivation. Violence also limits growth through its impact on human capital (and productivity), the distortion of public and private investments, increased security spending and uncertainty about property rights.-Some of the the lines of action proposed in the document to address this issue include the strengthening of local justice systems and the expansion of mental health care for victims of violence.-The report also looks at the fragility of the region's social protection systems, evidenced by their limited response capacity during the pandemic. The linking of risk insurance systems with formal employment has motivated governments to create parallel systems, of lower quality, to cover the people who are excluded, who are the majority in the region. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have segmented labor markets and social protection systems that reproduce inequalities and encourage the organization of production in very small and unproductive businesses. To tackle this issue, the document suggests rethinking social protection to ensure universality.-Finally, the report recommends that the solutions must lead to greater growth with environmental sustainability, and to greater inclusion and social mobility. These are solutions require balancing power by defining rules and policies, eradicating violence in all its forms and redefining the institutional environment that constitutes the essence of the social contract: opportunities in the labor market, taxation and social protection.-More information about the 2021 Regional Human Development Report.- -###-The United Nations Development Program is the leading United Nations agency dedicated to ending the injustice of poverty, inequality and climate change.

 GEORGETOWN, 15 JUNE 2021 – As Guyana experiences nationwide flooding, a National Flood Forecasting System (NFFS) was developed and is currently being operationally tested by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), Hydrometeorological Service. Under the Japanese Government funded project, “Strengthening Disaster Management Capacity of Women in Guyana and Dominica”, being implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), this system was developed by the Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) in close collaboration with the International Centre for Environmental Monitoring  (CIMA) Research Foundation and the Hydrometeorological Service, MoA. This announcement was made by the UNDP’s Resident Representative, Jairo Valverde, at a simple virtual closing ceremony for this component of the project and to formally hand over the NFFS to the MoA.-“Today I am pleased to announce the completion of a National Flood Forecasting System, which is an important element of a National Flood Early Warning System for Guyana. This Flood Forecasting System, developed by UNOSAT in collaboration with-CIMA Research Foundation, is currently being operationally tested by the MoA, Hydrometeorological Service over the period of this current rainy season all towards enhancing the capacity of the MoA, Hydrometeorological Service to forecast extreme flood events on a national scale.” Mr. Valverde said.-The NFFS was designed and calibrated for the prediction of extreme flood events that are caused by the overflow of rivers using meteorological and a nationwide hydrological model. Flooding caused by overtopping of manmade drainage canals along the coast of Guyana is however, not captured under this system. The NFFS is also linked to a two-dimensional hydraulic model piloted in four vulnerable flood-prone communities: Paruima (Region 7), Chenapau (Region 8), Lethem (Region 9) and Kwakwani (Region 10). As a result, the development of flood maps for these communities will be possible for extreme flood events only. However, the NFFS is designed to allow for its further development to capture areas that are not included under the current project.-Additionally, along with the technical set-up of the flood forecasting platform, capacity development activities were also implemented to ensure the sustainability of the NFFS, as well as enhance the technical skills and knowledge of key national stakeholders in the use of Geospatial Information Technology (GIT) for Flood Risk Management (FRM).-Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Zulfikar Mustapha, emphasized the importance of a NFFS.- “The current floods have devastated significant portions of farmlands, killed livestock, damaged private and public infrastructure and is likely to have severe social and public health impacts that are still to be fully assessed. Recovering from this event will no doubt require Government and the Ministry of Agriculture to redirect resources to address the challenges posed by the current situation, affecting planned interventions. It is in this context that the development of a National Flood Early Warning System becomes extremely relevant to the development of Guyana.” said the Minister.-Similar sentiments were made by His Excellency Tatsuo Hirayama, Ambassador of Japan to the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and Mr. Lauro Rossi, Director of Early Warning Programme at CIMA Research Foundation.-Dr. Einar Bjørgo, Director of UNOSAT, expressed thanks to all partners for having the confidence to engage UNITAR to develop such an important flood forecasting system along with knowledge transfer and technical backstopping activities implemented throughout the project scope. Dr. Bjørgo has also advocated for more collaborative efforts to support Guyana’s Government on climate information and impact-based flood forecasting systems in the near future.-After the testing period, the NFFS will be fully operational and will provide support for timely warnings for extreme flooding events. This would be beneficial to vulnerable communities, especially those currently experiencing severe flooding.

Chief Hydrometeorological Officer, Dr Garvin Cummings, thanked the UNDP, UNOSAT and the Government of Japan for their continued support to the MoA Hydrometeorological Service and reiterated the Government of Guyana’s commitment to the sustainability and continued advancement of the NFFS.
-The UNDP and UNOSAT will continue to support the MoA, Hydrometeorological Service during the operationally testing period towards ensuring that the system is fully functional, and the services of this system are utilized to reduce the impacts of disasters and climate change.

But if I speak in Akawaio, they understand me right away” said Mr Aubrey Austin, District Crop Extension Officer, Region 7.-While Guyana is an English speaking Country, several indigenous languages are spoken, hence it is beneficial to have Agricultural Extension Officers who can speak the local language. Mr. Austin, who is attached to the National Agriculture Research and Extension Institute (NAREI), communicates with farmers in the Akawaio language. This interaction has led to him fostering close relationships, especially with the older farmers who cannot understand English.-In Region 7, the main languages spoken among indigenous farmers are Akawaio and Aracuna. Translated materials for agriculture purposes is nonexistent, therefore, Mr. Austin’s role in ensuring local farmers receive information orally cannot be underscored.-Mr Austin’s duties are many, which includes collaborating with the United Nations Development Programme and the Ministry of Agriculture Hydrometeorological Services to train smallholder farmers to integrate climate information in their agricultural practices using the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) tool. This training is being implemented as part of the Japanese government funded project, “Strengthening Disaster Management Capacity of Women in the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and Commonwealth of Dominica.”- -At training workshops, the project ensures that the PICSA tool is communicated to the target community by involving local Agriculture Extension Officers who can communicate with farmers in their local language. This initiative enables the flow of information on agricultural and climate concepts, to and from the Farmers, in their mother tongue.-“We are thankful that we can have presentations in Akawaio because our elders cannot understand English” said Ms. Kayleen George, a farmer from Warwatta Village who participated in a PICSA training workshop. “I was not aware that Fox eats our corn, but from the response by the elders, I now know” she continued.-Communicating in the Farmers’ local language is advantageous for Mr. Austin’s work since it gives him an in-depth knowledge of their traditional farming practices. This Indigenous Agricultural Knowledge enables him to integrate new practices, such as Climate Smart and Disaster Risk Reduction Agriculture, into traditional practices of Indigenous Farmers.-As an extension officer, Mr Austin is successfully bridging the language gap between insiders and outsiders of communities in Region 7. Using the local language, through the PICSA tool, he is ensuring that farmers, especially the elders, are equipped with the relevant information to address a varying and changing climate.-UNDP in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Hydrometeorological Services and the National Agriculture Research and Extension Institute (NAREI) will continue this training in other regions to enhance farmers’ capacity to alleviate the impacts of disasters and climate change.-

At a very young age they migrated to neighboring Venezuela in search of a better life. However, in 2010, now ageing, they decided to return to their homeland to live permanently in the village of their birth. Among their possessions were pieces of garden hose which Marco thought would be useful in Guyana.-During the dry seasons, the availability of water for household use and watering crops is limited. However, residents like Marco are using innovative ways to address this problem. Marco now harvests water in a pond located on the nearby mountain and transports it to his backyard using the pieces of hose that he brought from Venezuela. This initiative reduces the effort of carrying water long distances to water his crops in his home garden where he grows several crops, including, Corn, Cassava, Pepper, Banana and Sugarcane.-Water harvesting is a Climate Smart, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) initiative that can reduce the risk of disasters, such as floods and droughts. The Japanese government funded project, “Strengthening Disaster Management Capacity of Women in the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and Commonwealth of Dominica”, provides support to Smallholder Farmers to adapt similar DRR initiatives.
- -This support is necessary, especially for Smallholder Farmers who are most vulnerable to such disasters. Maria is determined to further reduce the labour intensive task of watering crops daily.-“We need more hose to take the water directly into our home and garden” says Maria. “But we can’t afford it since it is too expensive” she explained. Residents are very proud of Mr. and Ms. Blanco’s achievements.-“We would like to use a system like this to provide water for our shade house” says Ms. Sandra Edmund, head of the Paruima Women’s Agriculture Group. “It would be a permanent fix to our water problem since it does not dry out in the dry season” she said.-The Blanco’s water harvesting system eliminates the need for a water pump to distribute the water. This is because the water source is located on the mountain at a higher elevation than their garden, hence, providing a gravity flow suitable for irrigating crops.-Thanks to Mr. and Ms. Blanco, residents are seeing a tangible example of how simple solutions can address a complex problem.-

The support is targeted at vulnerable groups (mostly women) who are more at risk of violence during the pandemic given social isolation measures, restricted movement and increased economic pressures within the household.-EnGenDER is a key initiative (being implemented by the UNDP in partnership with UN Women, World Food Program and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA)) that seeks to address the issue of climate change impacts particularly on vulnerable groups such as women, children, youth, persons living with disabilities, and indigenous and tribal populations and is co-funded by the Government of Canada and the UK Government.  Recognizing that COVID-19 has brought new challenges and hurdles for the people of Guyana including many who are trapped at home with their abusers, EnGenDER reallocated part  of the project funding to support efforts to help stop violence while simultaneously supporting the people who have been victims of this violence.-
The support includes: (1)  the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) which will benefit over 100 officers within the Guyana Police Force who are trained to handle GBV issues; (2) the distribution of food hampers through the Ministry of Human Services and Social Security which will benefit 470 vulnerable women and other vulnerable groups, many of whom are survivors of gender-based violence; and (3) the supply of communication equipment including 3 GPS units, 3 satellite phones and 3 laptop computers to the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development which  is expected to improve real time communications and enhance data management and analysis in remote communities, to help improve disaster management, including COVID-19 response. The project, through the Office of the President, is also currently exploring options for installing handwashing stations in several vulnerable communities and supporting GBV messaging.-
Guyana Resident Representative (UNDP), Mr. Jairo Valverde, noted that “the effects of climate change and natural disasters exacerbate the challenges of inequality and socioeconomic vulnerability. Gender equality and human rights are essential to the successful implementation of disaster risk management strategies. The best investment we can make for tomorrow is to develop influential strategies today to ensure resilience for the future. We are very grateful to the Government of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom, and through them, to their taxpayers for the support to the project that has made this venture possible in contributing to the country’s COVID 19 response initiative in Guyana”.-
The EnGenDER Project has as its core objective to assist the Caribbean in becoming a more resilient region where there is a reduced impact of natural disasters on the public sector and vulnerable persons.  The EnGenDER COVID-19 Response Initiative is providing USD$ 1,149,000 to the nine (9) ODA eligible beneficiary countries to implement projects and activities which address gender-based violence, curb the spread of the coronavirus and provide essential goods and services as well as income support to the most vulnerable to strengthen their emergency response. These initiatives ensure that the project’s overall objective of reducing rather than exacerbating gender vulnerabilities is achieved by making certain that society’s most vulnerable are reached and assisted during and after crises.-For Additional Information on the COVID Response Initiative or the EnGenDER Project please contact Mr. Massimiliano Tozzi, Project Manager at email address massimiliano.tozzi@undp.org.-Partner Links:

In the wake of COVID-19, record-breaking temperatures and spiraling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.-“As this report shows, no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without putting immense strain on the planet. But we could be the first generation to right this wrong. That is the next frontier for human development,” he said.-The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time to for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.-To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).-By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress.-With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress. For example, more than 50 countries drop out of the very high human development group, reflecting their dependence on fossil fuels and material footprint.-Despite these adjustments, countries like Costa Rica, Moldova, and Panama move upwards by at least 30 places, recognizing that lighter pressure on the planet is possible.-“The Human Development Report is an important product by the United Nations. In a time where action is needed, the new generation of Human Development Reports, with greater emphasis on the defining issues of our time such as climate change and inequalities, helps us to steer our efforts towards the future we want,” said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, host country of the launch of the report.-The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.-For example, new estimates project that by 2100 the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather due to climate change each year- a number that could be cut in half if the Paris Agreement on climate change is fully implemented.-And yet fossil fuels are still being subsidized: the full cost to societies of publicly financed subsidies for fossil fuels - including indirect costs - is estimated at over US$5 trillion a year, or 6.5 percent of global GDP, according to International Monetary Fund figures cited in the report.-Reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.-“While humanity has achieved incredible things, it is clear that we have taken our planet for granted,” said Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy Youth. “Across the world young people have spoken up, recognizing that these actions put our collective future at risk. As the 2020 Human Development Report makes clear, we need to transform our relationship with the planet — to make energy and material consumption sustainable, and to ensure every young person is educated and empowered to appreciate the wonders that a healthy world can provide.”-How people experience planetary pressures is tied to how societies work, says Pedro Conceição, Director of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office and lead author of the report, and today, broken societies are putting people and planet on a collision course.-Inequalities within and between countries, with deep roots in colonialism and racism, mean that people who have more capture the benefits of nature and export the costs, the report shows. This chokes opportunities for people who have less and minimizes their ability to do anything about it.-For example, land stewarded by indigenous peoples in the Amazon absorbs, on a per person basis, the equivalent carbon dioxide of that emitted by the richest 1 percent of people in the world. However, indigenous peoples continue to face hardship, persecution and discrimination, and have little voice in decision-making, according to the report.-And discrimination based on ethnicity frequently leaves communities severely affected and exposed to high environmental risks such as toxic waste or excessive pollution, a trend that is reproduced in urban areas across continents, argue the authors.-According to the report, easing planetary pressures in a way that enables all people to flourish in this new age requires dismantling the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of transformation.-Public action, the report argues, can address these inequalities, with examples ranging from increasingly progressive taxation, to protecting coastal communities through preventive investment and insurance, a move that could safeguard the lives of 840 million people who live along the world’s low elevation coastlines. But there must be a concerted effort to ensure that actions do not further pit people against planet.-“The next frontier for human development is not about choosing between people or trees; it’s about recognizing, today, that human progress driven by unequal, carbon-intensive growth has run its course,” said Pedro Conceição.-“By tackling inequality, capitalizing on innovation and working with nature, human development could take a transformational step forward to support societies and the planet together,” he said.-To learn more about the 2020 Human Development report and UNDP’s analysis on the experimental Planetary Pressures-Adjusted HDI, visit http://hdr.undp.org/en/2020-report-###-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Corruption is also fuelling distrust of leaders and institutions -- and depleting valuable resources for financing development and recovery.  We are seeing the impacts of corruption being felt in service delivery, procurement processes, and the management of funds, economic stimulus packages and social protection measures. As a result, corruption has manifested itself through the circulation of defective ventilators, poorly manufactured COVID-19 tests, and counterfeit medicines -- while the equitable distribution of life-saving vaccines is at severe risk.-Every year, an estimated $2.6 trillion is lost to corruption globally. At least $500 billion is siphoned off due to corruption in the health sector -- that may be more than the total cost of ensuring global Universal Health Coverage for everyone. On the ground in 170 countries, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting governments to integrate transparency, accountability and anti-corruption in both response and recovery priorities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our support has focused on everything from working with the World Health Organization and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to integrate anti-corruption measures into health systems -- to supporting Ukraine to implement a new e-platform to increase transparency in procurement. Indeed, amongst a range of areas, UNDP’s Next Generation of Anti-Corruption programming aims to further harness the benefits of technology and innovation in enhancing transparency and openness.-UNDP itself takes all cases of financial mismanagement and other irregularities extremely seriously to ensure that the organization is fit-for-purpose. In concrete terms, we are working to continuously improve our oversight and risk management systems. Indeed, the entire United Nations system will continue to prioritize transparency and accountability, in and beyond the COVID-19 response. -This year’s UN campaign for International Anti-Corruption Day 2020, Recover with Integrity, emphasizes that an inclusive COVID-19 recovery can only be achieved with integrity and accountability. The UN will be on hand, at the request of governments, to strengthen critical transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption measures. That includes implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and monitoring the progress of Sustainable Development Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda. In sum, standing up to corruption will accelerate progress on the Global Goals towards that more inclusive, resilient and sustainable future.-Achim Steiner, Administrator, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)- ",[],"Speeches,Administrator,Achim Steiner,Ukraine,WHO,News"

It also aimed to ensure that accountability, as an integral part of sustainable social cohesion, remains at the heart of the support which the United Nations is providing to religious leaders and actors in Iraq, to advance healing, trust building, reconciliation, and social cohesion, by countering hate speech. More than 40 faith leaders from across Iraq took part in the conference, including some of the leaders representing parties to the Interfaith Statement.-United Nations Under-Secretary-General (USG) and Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Ms. Alice Nderitu said that “moving forward, bringing peace and building a joint future requires accountability as well as re-knitting the social fabric of the country, from the highest levels in the government institutions in Baghdad to the smallest villages at the heart of the country. This is in the hands of each and every one of Iraq’s citizens and religious leaders have a key role to play. This requires the involvement of all communities, and we are here to support you.”-Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator to Iraq, Ms. Irena Vojáčková-Sollorano, stated that “the United Nations recognizes the important role of religious leaders in promoting coexistence, preventing violence and extremism, and addressing the needs and grievances of the Iraqi people. While we recognize that the government has the primary responsibility to protect populations, many actors, such as religious leaders who have a strong influence on the lives and behavior of those who follow their faith, shall play an important role in strengthening mutual respect in communities. That is why today’s event is so important.” -In his opening remarks, Special Adviser (SA) and Head of UNITAD Mr. Christian Ritscher stressed that “ensuring accountability for Da’esh/ISIL international crimes and serving justices to the victims from all Iraqi communities are key in ensuring viable reconciliation in Iraq”, adding that “the Interfaith Statement came as an important acknowledgment by faith leaders of the tremendous suffering which Iraqi communities endured as a result of Da’esh/ISIL crimes. It reflected a core belief of UNITAD, and the UN at large: there is no hierarchy in victims. The magnitude of ISIL/Da’esh crimes affected all Iraqi faiths and communities, and to us, each and every victim of such international crimes matter, from all communities that suffered from ISIL crimes.”-UNDP Resident Representative for Iraq, Ms. Zena Ali-Ahmad says, “Today’s conference demonstrates a unified approach to peacebuilding in Iraq.  Engaging with interfaith religious leaders across the country is key to promoting cohesion between groups and is a necessary step to building a strong social fabric.  UNDP is committed to working with our partners to ensure all Iraqis are supported during the journey towards sustainable peace through our ongoing work to promote moderate religious discourse, prevent violent extremism, combat hate speech, and encourage reconciliation and reintegration of Internally Displaced Persons back into their communities.”-During the conference, the United Nations senior officials reiterated their full and unwavering commitment to victims of  ISIL/ Da’esh crimes, which targeted a broad range of communities whether Christian, Kaka’i, Shabak, Shia, Turkmen, Sunni or Yazidi.-Participants at the event discussed challenges and opportunities to ensure that justice for all victims and survivors can be achieved, highlighting the importance of holding ISIL/Da’esh perpetrators accountable for the serious allegations of international crimes committed by them through national courts.-The attending religious leaders renewed their commitment to dialogue and mutual understanding between religious communities in Iraq in areas most impacted by ISIL/Da’esh crimes. They also identified challenges faced by survivors of ISIL/Da’esh crimes, particularly those who have been subject to sexual and gender-based crimes. They also explored means of further coordination with the UN co-hosting entities to effectively engage religious communities in Iraq in promoting accountability as an integral part of viable social cohesion. -Religious leaders and actors reiterated the commitment expressed in the March 2020 Interfaith Statement and renewed their repudiation and condemnation of the violence committed by Da’esh/ISIL as completely contrary to their respective faiths. The Statement also underscored that member of all religions across Iraq have been impacted by the crimes of Da’esh/ISIL, and that all survivors must be supported in their efforts to move on with their lives within their communities. The Interfaith Statement built upon the Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide’s Plan of Action for Religious Leaders and Actors to Counter Incitement Which Could Lead to Atrocity Crimes.-Following liberation from ISIL/Daesh, UNDP has engaged with over 2,500 leaders through its Social Cohesion Programme, and lately during 2021-2022, UNDP-Iraq facilitated dialogue forums among 300 religious leaders from different sects in Anbar, Diyala, Ninewa, and Salah al-Din.

Equipment was stolen and infrastructure was left destroyed. Prior to rehabilitation of the health facilities, residents were forced to travel more than fifteen kilometers to Fallujah Teaching Hospital for treatment and medical services.-The two facilities were rehabilitated by UNDP’s Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS) with generous funding provided by the Government of Australia.  In addition, the Government of Denmark provided furniture and USAID supplied equipment to the Al-Sijr Public Health Centre.-""The reopening of the External Consultancy Clinic and Al-Sijr Public Health Centre in Al-Karma is an important milestone to restoring essential health services across the region. However, our commitment to building Iraq forward better and stabilizing areas affected by ISIL do not end here. We have also supported the rehabilitation of over 50 health facilities in Anbar alone. This includes clinics, public health centers, hospitals and even specialty hospitals such as maternity and dental clinics,” says UNDP Resident Representative in Iraq, Zena Ali Ahmad.-“We are here today because of the generous funding and longstanding partnership with the international community. The rehabilitation of the two facilities would not have been possible without the support provided by the Government of Australia. I would also like to thank Government of Denmark for providing the furniture and USAID for supplying the equipment at the Al-Sijr Public Health Centre,” she added. -“Australia values our longstanding partnership with the Government of Iraq and UNDP and is proud to support recovery efforts in this country. The conflict with ISIL left severe damage to vital infrastructure and impacted the lives of many Iraqis, says Ms. Paula Ganly, the Australian Ambassador to Iraq.-“The Australian Government believes that access to adequate health care is a basic human right. The rehabilitation and functioning of these clinics will provide essential health services to Karma district and surrounds,” she added.-Since 2015, through the Funding Facility for Stabilization, UNDP has completed around 3,100 stabilization projects across the liberated areas of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa, Salah Al-Din.

She commended the Government of Jamaica for bringing the Act into effect in February, noting that the legislation is an important asset to expand opportunities for PWDs.-“Education is the currency with which persons living with disabilities can acquire professional and personal growth, with no limits on their potential,” the Resident Representative said.  She committed to expanding UNDP’s partnership with the CDA, School for the Blind and JAD throughout 2022 and beyond to ensure they are not left behind as contributors and beneficiaries of Jamaica’s development goals.-“Braille machines are to blind students what pen and pencils are to other students ... They are used daily for reading, writing all class-related teaching and learning, including homework”, Salvation Army School for the Blind Principal, Iyeke Erharuyi explained in his acceptance remarks. He said without enough machines to assign to each student, learning outcomes have been severely impacted. He disclosed that many of the school’s old braille machines malfunction every two weeks on average and are often out of circulation awaiting parts and maintenance. The donation of 20 new machines will improve access by students, while strengthening class participation, literacy and numeracy, he explained.   -JAD Interpreting Officer, Mary-Angela Fatta also indicated that inadequate equipment is a challenge for the Association’s several schools spanning four parishes. She disclosed that less than half of JAD’s teachers and Deaf Culture Facilitators have access to a reliable school issued device to support teaching and learning of 230 students. “The laptops received will be utilised by the instructors to ensure this process is effective as well as to ensure the visual nature of Deaf and Hard of Hearing learners is addressed,” she said.-Gloria Goffe, CDA Executive Director said for seven years, staff of the Association struggled with office equipment, including computers designated obsolete in their audit report. This led to a slow work rate, late responses, delayed completion of work and increased expenditure on updates and repairs, she explained. “The donations have increased the productivity of the staff; and reduced the Association’s dependence on borrowed computers. The computers have also improved the Association’s capacity to properly establish a membership database in one location,” Ms Goffe pointed out.-UNDP routinely supports vulnerable communities including Persons with Disabilities to reduce inequalities and exclusion in the spirit of leaving no one behind. The Multi Country Office’s new Country Programme 2022 – 2026 places some emphasis on empowering vulnerable communities to realise their development aspirations in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals and Jamaica’s Vision 2030 plan for national development.- -NOTE: UNDP uses the latest United Nations Operational Rate of Exchange (UNORE) dated 1 March 2022, of J$154.219 Jamaican dollars to US$1.00- ","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Goal 4  Quality education,Poverty reduction and inequality,Latin America & the Caribbean,News,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities"

Authenticated users can use the system to locate different types of known mineral deposits across Jamaica; identify location and boundaries of areas licensed for mining, adjacent housing, roads, upcoming developments and Protected Areas bordering mined and unmined deposits; apply for relevant licenses; as well as manage and track the status and performance of mining license applications.-Funding was provided by the European Union (EU) under the OACPS-EU Development Minerals Programme which is implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Mining in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Multi Country Office in Jamaica.-In delivering the keynote address at the launch, Minister of Transport and Mining, Hon. Audley Shaw, noted that artisans, mining and quarry operators, geologists, mining investors and government agencies will experience short and long-term positive impacts on the mining sector. “The system significantly improves the existing procedures and the management of mineral licenses and related documentation. It provides a client-focused user-friendly interface to investors and other users,” he explained.-Minister Shaw said that JAMinCAD “will allow future changes to reflect the state of legal and regulatory frameworks and modification of licensing procedures with little or no software modification. The system will enable transparent and internationally recognized best practices of granting and managing mineral licenses throughout the country.”-In noting that the database’s web maps can identify adjacent Protected Areas, Minister Shaw said, “we have to take a very balanced approach to how we access our resources while protecting our environment as well as protecting our water resources”.   -He congratulated the teams from the Ministry, the UNDP and project consultants Compet-Terra for making the project a reality and acknowledged the strong partnership and support that the European Union has offered to Jamaica’s minerals sector, particularly through the OACPS-EU Development Minerals Programme. “The UNDP and EU have offered a crucial partnership geared towards building the profile and improving the management of the development minerals industry in Jamaica,” the Minister said.-“This tool has come at a time when the need for investments is increased significantly, which is pivotal to realising growth and development, especially as we work to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. ... The Mining Cadastre is timely and augurs well for the country’s path to economic recovery” Minister Shaw said.-UNDP Resident Representative Denise Antonio lauded the digital platform as another milestone in Jamaica’s bold mission to becoming a digital society.-She pointed out that by going digital, government agencies have boosted their capacity to monitor compliance, manage the industry and generate data, which are all keys to strengthening productivity, efficiency and planning. “We regard this development as a major addition to the expanding architecture of the digital society, and a gamechanger for generating inclusive and sustainable growth within the sector,” she stated.-The UNDP Resident Representative said consistent with the shared commitment to accelerated progress through digital transformation, more than one third of the Development Minerals Programme budget is allocated for the procurement of technology. “Today’s launch is therefore the latest technology asset transfer designed to strengthen the Ministry’s capacity to manage the sector. Previously, we have handed over Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Computer Servers and other equipment, as well as fast-speed wireless internet technology with greater capabilities,” she disclosed.-Mr Aniceto Rodriguez Ruiz, Head of Cooperation, Delegation of the EU in Jamaica EU said JAMinCAD is an example of how digitalization can improve the management of a sector. He noted that the system will help to address key issues related to non-compliance with relevant mining legislation and regulations by generating notices to companies and making changes to legal and regulatory frameworks more accessible to industry players. “The launch of JAMinCAD is a step in the right direction for the country and we at the European Union are hopeful that the relevant players will take advantage of this important development,” he stated.-The Development Minerals Programme is designed to foster increased employment and income for artisanal and small-scale mining enterprises (ASMEs), and in particular, increased economic opportunities for women participating in ASMEs throughout the Development Minerals value chain.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Information and communications technology,Goal 1  No poverty,Latin America & the Caribbean,News,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth"

Ministry of Education and Youth. Private Sector Organization of Jamaica. Planning Institute of Jamaica. RISE Life Management Services.-We partnered to seek answers to one critical question: What if we moved youth from the margins to the leadership of citizen safety and security interventions targeting their peers?-We tested our theory in two main ways:-First, by strengthening mechanisms to foster youth participation in decision making;-Second, by financing and mentoring youth groups to implement innovative and sustainable solutions in Citizen Security and Safety.-Today, the AYVA 10 are here to demonstrate why our investments in their co-leadership of crime prevention interventions are worthwhile.-You will see a demonstration of many insights and lessons learned.-You will also see results indicating that this pilot project can be upscaled to ensure that youth led crime prevention programmes flourish.-Above all you will see that young people have the capacity and insight to co create and lead crime prevention and peacebuilding strategies.-They represent a remarkable generation of young leaders who are working in tandem with national development aspirations for a peaceful and just society.-Sustainability is now crucial in this period. UNDP will be working with our partners to upscale the best and most promising of the micro projects for phase two implementation.-But we need the support of government and development partners to secure the gains made through the AYVA Project, and other similar initiatives.  -I called for Government to consider establishing a national Knowledge Sharing and Empowerment Network on peace, crime prevention and citizen safety and security for youth organizations at the Youth Summit on Crime and Violence in September 2021.-I reiterate my call today.-Such a network can bring obscure best practices in youth-led crime prevention efforts to national attention so they can be multiplied for greater impact.-We could empower the network with mentorship, resources, crime prevention micro grant funding and other opportunities to encourage youth innovation.-We believe that this would be a powerful supplement to existing crime prevention interventions.-Truly, I believe coopting the efforts of young people can help cut the problem at its root, before its turns into a young person shooting a gun.-I call on Government to identify, empower and mentor young people to help each other and their communities, and to encourage their creativity and innovation.  -I challenge our young people to continue to innovate whether your place has been set at the implementation table or not. Keep the ideas flowing. [PAUSE]-I must commend our partners for joining us on this important process of discovery and multigenerational mentorship. AYVA would not have been possible without you.-The next chapter holds much promise, but only if we remain open and responsive to the fresh ideas of young people.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through its GEF Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP) joins in celebrating this initiative, made possible with the contribution of a USD93,000 GEF SGP grant under the “Resilience Strengthening to Climate Change Impacts through Youth Education in Primary Schools” project.  I am pleased that this activity directly supports the Government of Jamaica’s initiative dubbed ‘Renewed Jamaica’, geared at climate action in homes, schools, churches, and communities, and that sustainability is ensured by integrating the text into school curriculum.  -This book is an excellent example of how to better understand the science of living things, the science of climate change in the Caribbean, implications for possible future changes in the climate and the urgent need for us to make a difference- How can environmental education help to combat and strengthen the global fight against climate change? It helps young people to understand the consequences of global warming, encourages them to change their behaviour, and helps them to adapt to this climate emergency through innovative youth friendly initiatives.-The evidence from a UNEP survey taken in 2011 is clear, 84% of young people surveyed agreed that they need more information to prevent climate change, while earlier studies from a GlobeScan survey indicated that 89% of youth polled globally say young people can make a difference on climate change. By 2015, close to half a million youth around the world had taken action on climate change through joint SGP UNDP projects.  -UNDP is convinced that by educating children and young people, we can nurture a new generation of change agents capable of encouraging their peers to adopt positive behaviours that combat the varying impacts of climate change. Through environmental literacy, we can cultivate a culture of care for the planet.- I wish to acknowledge Professor Michael Taylor and his team for the excellent work that led to the production of this important new knowledge product. I am grateful to all who contributed, whether as writers, editors or publishers, and for keeping this important issue of Climate change on the agenda.-You have our word that UNDP and GEF SGP will continue to be responsive to the vision of adapting to the impacts of climate change, and to ensure that young people are suitably integrated and empowered to lead this movement in the future.-Our commitment is anchored on UNDP’s corporate mission to help countries end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change, and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Projects designed to secure SDG number 13, Climate Action, are of particular importance at this time.  Together, we can produce a stronger and more honest form of partnership and nation building to make this goal a reality in our lifetime.

The bright side though is the level at which digital transformation has fast tracked in both public and private sectors, to improve access to varied services and products.-Despite this growth, we recognise that these digital advancements while beneficial, is also driving inequalities among our most vulnerable. Considering this current development context and the need for inclusive digital transformation – which supports the National Development Plan, Vision 2030  and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals –  the  launch of this initiative is both timely and valuable.-The Digital Readiness Assessment tool supports countries in assessing their digital transformation pathway, providing RAPID, HIGH-LEVEL INSIGHTS on OPPORTUNITIES, GAPS, and PRIORITIES.-The DRA  provides a unique opportunity to engage a wide cross section of stakeholders including the Private Sector in advancing a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to digital transformation.  -The DRA and the participation of the private sector is also well aligned to the mandate of the PSOJ to inform and participate in Jamaica’s digital transformation.-UNDP’s global 2022-2025 Digital Strategy recognises the value of strategic partnerships in catalysing digital development.  We are therefore pleased that the private sector is participating in this critical initiative.-We are hopeful that today’s workshop and the findings of this assessment will support national efforts and sustained actions in achieving Jamaica’s vision to become a digital and technology-enabled society.-Thank You and have a productive workshop.- ","['Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Innovation,Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Speeches,Latin America & the Caribbean,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities"

This day is aimed at raising awareness on the fact that we have “only one Earth”, and our collective survival depends on it.-But this year WED comes at a critical moment in history, as the world is grappling with the triple crises of climate change, ecosystem degradation, and the continued devastating effects of COVID-19. There are two things we have learnt from dealing with these crises. First, they require global multi-lateral cooperation and solidarity.-No one country can solve these issues on their own. Second, solutions cannot be left to governments only; we all have collective and individual responsibilities to do our part, no matter how small, to save Mother Earth and protect ourselves from global crises.-With respect to climate change, despite all the denial, science has prevailed, and there is growing global consensus that it is real. Certainly, it is a very present reality for many people in Liberia. Even those who may not know much about greenhouse gases and increasing atmospheric temperatures, have noticed that rising sea levels are decimating the country’s coastline and wreaking havoc in the lives of thousands of families across Liberia.-From West Point and New Kru Town in Monrovia, and indeed the entire coastline from Robertsport to Harper, there are thousands of families who can point out to sea to show some location where their homes once stood. Abandoned homes on the edge of the coast battered by sea storms, roads abruptly cut off by sea erosion and schools which only continue to stand because of protective rock revetments constructed to hold at bay the advancing ocean are all evidence of the reality of climate change.-The country’s unique forests and wetlands are also under assault from shifting agriculture, mining, logging and construction activities. Losing these valuable ecosystems would present a double tragedy because these ecosystems provide vital environmental services including absorbing atmospheric carbon helping to minimize temperature increases that are driving climate change.-The degradation of forests and wetlands is also accompanied by the loss of plants, animals and other creatures that may hold the key to cures for diseases such as cancer, malaria, Ebola and COVID-19. The clearing of forests and draining of wetlands, littering and polluting the environment are putting our very own lives at risk. With 68% of biodiversity lost globally in the past 50 years, it appears we are consigning ourselves to extinction!-And, as if climate change and biodiversity loss are not enough, COVID-19 has thrown another spanner into the works. The world is struggling to get back on its feet after COVID-19 claimed millions of lives, brought the global economy to a standstill for well over a year, and reversed critical development gains. COVID-19 has proved to be more than a medical emergency.-It disrupted health services, stunted agricultural production, throttled small businesses that are the lifeline of most Liberians, and resulted in a further rise in poverty. It also wiped out an entire school year as the country’s limited access to electricity, computers and internet connectivity eliminated the digital learning option. COVID-19 sparked a development emergency that continues to unfold in unpredictable ways compelling governments, including that of Liberia, to review and revise their national development plans.  The world has been hit by a perfect storm.  -This year, which marks 50 years since the first UN conference in Stockholm on the environment and development, provides a timely opportunity for the world to pause and re-look at our relationship with nature, our goals and aspirations for growth and prosperity, and our resilience in the face of existing and emerging crises. We simply cannot afford to continue with business as usual, or to be caught as unprepared as we were for another global crisis.-Here in Liberia, the Stockholm +50 consultations engaged more than 900 Liberians in debates focusing on new ideas to achieve prosperity, a healthy planet, and greater preparedness and resilience to disasters. Women, youth, people with disabilities, students, NGOs, private sector companies, international development actors, and government officials, among others, all came together, recognizing our common destiny and shared responsibility. The discussions were rich, the recommendations practical, and the sense of urgency great.-Some examples of the priorities which emerged included better waste management at the household, city, and national levels, and the need to scale up plastic recycling into a full-fledged circular economy. (This is an area UNDP has started to act, partnering with Government to provide grants to some of Liberia’s waste management companies to help them scale up their activities. This is resulting in innovative waste recycling initiatives, job creation for youth and women, as well as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.) There were also calls for job creation programmes tied to forest protection activities.  -Liberians also recommended a multi-sectoral approach to post-COVID recovery that draws on lessons from past epidemics and creation of social safety nets to help those whose livelihoods were obliterated by lockdowns to get back on their feet. (UNDP this year supported LISGIS to undertake a comprehensive socio-economic impact assessment of COVID-19 on small informal businesses. The data, which is currently being analyzed, will help the government and development actors to design better targeted programmes and initiatives to aid a green, inclusive recovery from COVID-19.)-The full report from the consultations, with all the recommendations, was presented last week at the global Stockholm +50 conference in Sweden.-The clock is ticking towards 2030.  If there was one common refrain from the national consultations, it was “After all the talk, let us act!” This message was repeated during each consultation event. Now is the time to act. Many participants also agreed on the need to implement the commitments the government has signed up to and decentralize information dissemination to all counties because “Monrovia is not Liberia”.-So, as Liberians converge in Ganta and other parts of the country to observe World Environment Day, the messages are clear: We have only one Earth and a shared responsibility for ensuring sustainable use of our natural resources. We must act together to tackle climate change and confront global crises. The time to act is now.

The Situation Room is located at the ECOWAS compound in Monrovia.-The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Liberia Electoral Support Project, with support from the Embassy of Sweden in Monrovia and Irish Aid, worked with the PBO to revitalize and re-open the Situation Room to support Early Warning and Early Response mechanisms.-This project is an example of continuing UNDP support for peacebuilding and conflict prevention in Liberia through the Peacebuilding Office, focusing on addressing conflict by strengthening links between early warnings of electoral violence and the response, and preventing violence against women in elections and politics.-The Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon. Varney A. Sirleaf observed, “Although the name implies that the focus of the Situation Room is on elections and COVID-19 monitoring...it is actually a platform that also collects and reports alerts on a variety of issues...”-Initially established in August 2020, the Situation Room was used primarily to prevent violence associated with elections as well as COVID-19. It is connected to every county through the Liberia Early Warning and Response Network and is able to respond quickly to rising tensions and threats of violence throughout the country.  -UNDP Resident Representative Stephen Rodriques stated that “the peaceful conduct of the upcoming 2023 General Elections is critical to Liberia’s peace, development, and prosperity, and it is in our common collective interest. We should not allow politicking, we should not allow political gamesmanship, we should not allow those pursuing short-term political gain, we should not allow bigots and people with bias against women, and such, to hold back this society or worse, to set it on a course towards violence.”-Representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Defense, State, and Internal Affairs were in attendance, as well as representatives of the Land Commission, civil society organizations, the diplomatic corps, human rights organizations, and international partners.-At the ceremony, Mr. Rodriques also presented 20 motorbikes to the Liberia PBO. These will be used for early warning, data collection, and intervention in the field.-The Liberia Electoral Support Project applies novel approaches to make a qualitative difference and further progress in electoral assistance in Liberia.

Effective use of this system will reduce backlog of cases, detention periods, and will allow easy generation of reports for stakeholders at different levels of the criminal justice system in Liberia.-Speaking at a certification ceremony May 27, 2022, following a two-week intensive training, Chief Justice Francis Korkpor committed the Judiciary to ensuring that the system is sustained and emphasized that the use of the CMIS will strengthen access to justice.-Chief Justice Korkpor urged Clerks of Courts and Magistrates to make maximum use of the training to improve their work environment and avoid going back to the old ways of doing things.-He stressed the need for more capacity development initiatives targeting lower courts as the courts of first instance in the country. “It is imperative that we take a bottom to top approach for such interventions to implement reforms that achieve meaningful results,” Liberia’s Chief Justice noted.-Since its Independence in 1847, the Criminal Justice System in Liberia continues to face challenges in the proper management and reporting of cases. For example, in the Magisterial Courts, case records are kept in paper files that are susceptible to tampering, misplacement, or lost during case trials which hinders the pace of cases and quality of judgements.-“The current Case Management Information System will increase efficiency in case disposal, reduction of case backlog and addressing of pre-trial detention. Therefore, the system will serve to ensure that the Judiciary fosters Liberia’s human rights obligations such as the right to personal liberty and the right to a trial within reasonable time,” said UNDP Resident Representative Stephen Rodriques.-In his remarks at the certification program, Mr. Rodriques reiterated that the efficiency of the criminal justice system can only be enhanced if the relevant institutions can keep track and measure the progress of case disposal.-He noted that digital space is increasingly becoming an everyday public tool for doing business and supporting public service delivery, adding that Liberia needs to embrace this as a current reality which has become inevitable.-Rodriques stated that, “Going digital enables the judiciary to infinitely store, copy, and distribute data without depletion, and at very low costs”.-He applauded the fact that the CMIS is home grown, in that it was developed by a Liberian and all of the trainers were Liberians. “This demonstrates that Liberia has the human resource and technical capacity required to embrace digital transformation,” said UNDP Liberia Resident Representative.-As part of its support to improve the criminal justice system in Liberia, the UN’s Joint Rule of Law Programme, has supported the conception, design, development, and roll-out of the online Case Management Information System (CMIS) for the Judiciary, the Prosecution Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Liberia National Police.-The system also uses mobile apps which works both online and offline to ensure use in remote areas where internet connectivity is problematic. It includes security features and GPS functionality to capture locations where offences occur enabling their digital mapping.-As part of the support package, UNDP procured over twenty galaxy tablets and supported the development and printing of training manuals for use by judicial staff.",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Access to justice,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Governance and peacebuilding,News"

Zayzay Jr. during the second phase of the training sessions held in Ganta, Nimba County.-UNDP has also committed to procure laptops and printers to enhance MIA and GC capacity in consolidating all the reports from counties for internal and external use.-Given the importance the government has attached to reporting, Commissioner George Howe of the Governance Commission encouraged participants to use the skills and knowledge acquired from the training to improve reporting timelines.  “The government takes seriously the regular submission of reports by CSC coordinators because the reports are very vital for decision making,” Commissioner Howe noted.-Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Olayee Collins lauded the support from UNDP and its partners and urged beneficiaries to ensure that the training will make them more effective and change the narrative that a major shortcoming from CSC Coordinators is timely reporting.-“Our expectation is to see the knowledge you acquire from this training translated immediately into actions that allow you to step up and ensure the regularization of monthly and quarterly reporting,” Collins emphasized. He reaffirmed the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ commitment to ensuring that County Service Centers are empowered with the necessary skills and tools to sustain decentralization.-Participants expressed gratitude to the government and partners for the training and assured that the knowledge gained will be applied in their respective work at the CSCs.-The training which targets 45 local government staff, covers topics and presentations on data collection methods, data analysis strategy, customer service, as well as local government gender policy with specific emphasis on the goals, objectives, policy alignments and priority areas including policy commitments.-The statutory mandate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) is to administer the affairs of local administrations in the counties; to improve coordination between the central government in Monrovia and sub-national units at county levels, and to build capacity for effective decentralization and accountable local governance in Liberia.-Under the Liberia Decentralization Support Programme (LDSP), UNDP with funding from development partners, support the MIA as the lead agency of the government in the implementation of decentralization reforms and policies.

There are so many times we talk, and nothing is being done,” said Atty. Tonieh Talery Wiles, Founder and Executive Director of Women Entrepreneurs & Environmental Links, echoing many speakers who have said the same thing during the consultations.-“To accelerate the implementation of the SDGs in the context of the Agenda2030, the Government of Liberia should follow up international commitments with concrete actions, for example, by revising its budget to adequately finance development, and make it gender responsive,” says Mathias M. Yeanay, the Executive Director of the Institute of Research and Democratic Development (IREDD).-Urias Goll, an environmental specialist with USAID’s EcoHealth Alliance buttressed Yeanay’s comments saying: “Liberia needs to budget adequately for environment management, build its environmental institutions, and begin to think of developing sustainable products”.-The Stockholm+50 consultations were organized by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) with support from Sweden and facilitated by UNDP, as part of a global effort to stimulate discussions on the Earth’s triple crises – the climate emergency, the unprecedented socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, and continued degradation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity.-The consultations were designed as an inclusive process that brought on board the views of people from all walks of life - women, youth, civil society, academia, religious groups, people with disabilities; the whole of government and the whole of society, on how the country could attain a healthy environment that supports the prosperity of all people.-Speaking at the final national consultations, the Executive Director of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Professor Wilson Tarpeh said the proposals and recommendations from the consultations would be used to complete Liberia’s strategy for management the environment for the prosperity of the people and country.-He promised to re-look at the Agency’s budget to increase resources for information dissemination and awareness raising, saying less than one percent of the institution’s budget is currently spent on creating environmental awareness.-While appreciative of their inclusion in the Stockholm+50 consultations, people with disabilities lamented not having been sufficiently included in the country’s development initiatives such as the national response to COVID-19 and climate change.-“There is nothing about us without us,” said Peter Flomo, the President of the National Union of Organizations for people with Disabilities (NUOD).-“Disability is not inability. We can only survive in an environmentally friendly society. Dumping waste products in drainages and building on water ways results in flooding making it difficult for visually impaired and physically challenged to move around without resulting in their exclusion from society?”-Key issues that emerged from the consultations include the management of plastic waste and the need for better environmental sanitation, especially along the country’s beaches; enhancing sustainable forest management and governance; achieving food security and sustainable recovery from Covid-19, and dealing with corruption.-Participants at every consultation session held stressed the need for massive public awareness, advocacy and community outreach saying, “Monrovia is not Liberia”.-“We need clear information to pass on to our people through the religious community to help raise awareness. God charged man from the very beginning to care for the environment,” said Episcopal Bishop James B. Selee.-“To accelerate implementation of the environmental dimension of the SDGs in the context of Agenda2030, partners must plan with, and not for, the media in order to effectively raise public awareness,” said Siatta Scott-Johnson, President of the Female Journalist Association of Liberia (FEJAL).-UN Resident Representative Niels Scott commended the media for taking the Stockholm+50 discussions into the homes of Liberians.-In the wake of Liberia signing a new international treaty aimed at ending the use of single use plastics, stakeholders in the waste management sector said opportunities for recycling plastic were “endless”, recommending that the government evaluate the plastic waste value chain, scientifically study the problem, follow through its commitments, develop a system for shared responsibility of waste management between government and other stakeholders.-“Liberia should consider using the tax system to control plastic pollution by putting a price tag on all plastic products,” said Dorsla Farcarthy, the team leader for UNDP’s Green and Inclusive Growth Programme.-On forest management, Atty. Gertrude Nyanley-Korvayan of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) highlighted the absence and sidelining of women, whose lives and livelihoods are intricately linked to the country’s forests.-“The rural Liberian woman sees the forest as her hospital, her market, her supermarket yet she is grossly under-represented in its governance right from the community level. This must change,” she lamented.-The international community was asked to be fair and compensate Liberia for protecting its forests for the carbon sequestration services they were rendering. “We have not received any results-based payment for the forests we have been protecting. We ask for a fair share for keeping our landscapes as pristine as possible; this is to enable our citizens living on the fringes of forests to make a livelihood,” said Mr. Johnson Willabo, the Assistant Minister for Mines and Energy.-Some students were concerned about their prospects for getting jobs, the quality of education and health services, as well as leadership, particularly at the community level. They also expressed concern that the scourge of corruption was compromising their future.-The Covid-19 pandemic, which took a heavy toll on jobs and employment, was described as a good early warning mechanism that revealed the need for Liberia to pay attention to domestic food production and build resilience. ""What we are doing now is importing poverty and exporting our wealth, which must stop,"" said Robert Bimba of Community of Hope Agriculture Project (CHAP).-FAO’s Dr. Patrice Savadogo said farmers needed climate information at the right time in order to know what to plant and when, if green recovery was to be accomplished. “We must eat what we produce and produce what we eat,” he reiterated.-UNDP’s Resident Representative Stephen Rodriques warned: “With the world having lost about 68% of its species since 1972, it looks as if humanity is choosing extinction. Everyone must seize the opportunity presented by these consultations to take positive actions for the environment in their own way. These individual actions add up to make the BIG change we all want to see.”-The various ideas, views and proposals from the consultations will be compiled into a national report to be presented at the Stockholm+50 international meeting scheduled to take place in Stockholm from June 2-3, 2022.",[],"Climate change and disaster risk reduction,News,Liberia"

The VP also called for the development of a second phase of the project that will include the establishment of a corruption court in Liberia to address impunity.-The Judiciary which plays an important role in nation building, has the responsibility to administer the rule of law from which flows order and stability for the people. Whenever there are disputes, the courts serve as the forum where people are heard and receive justice.-Chief Justice Francis Korkpor at the ceremony stressed that, “People everywhere have the right to have access to justice. This is a cardinal right of all mankind. There must be a forum where people can have redress to their grievances.” The Chief Justice in his remaks reminded Magistrates of their responsibility in ensuring that their decisions are correct and that they will bring satisfaction to the people. ""It is not the beautiful court that will bring access to justice. What will make people satisfied is the quality of judgments that will come from this court.”-Access to affordable and quality services from the court remains critical to bringing justice closer to the people and reducing the number of cases on the dockets. In this regard, UNDP Resident Representative Stephen Rodriques believes that the judiciary as well as lawyers are in a unique position to help people in times of need.-Making remarks at the opening of the Magisterial Court in Botota, Mr. Rodriques emphasized that it was important for citizens to have trust and confidence in the commitment of the Judiciary to deliver justice. He stressed the importance of strengthening public confidence in governance structures.-Mr. Rodriques noted that while the court forms part of the Judiciary’s assets, it reflects UNDP’s people-centered approach to justice which is responsive to the needs of the people to uphold the rule of law. “This approach relies on the perspectives, needs, strengths, and expectations of the justice-user to improve the quality of justice and reduce barriers to service delivery,” said UNDP Resident Representative.-He hailed the partnership with the Governments of Sweden and Liberia and encouraged residents of Botota to own and protect the facility.-“To the people and communities of Botota, I wish to state that this is your court.

In partnership with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Ministry of Interior (MoI), Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the European Union (EU), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) launched today the “Development of Juvenile System” joint project.-Children encounter the justice system as victims, witnesses, because they are in contact with the law or as parties to the justice process, such as in custodial arrangements. In the past, the juvenile justice system in Libya was deemed progressive as it diverted children away from prison and placed them in care institutions outside the prison system. After nearly a decade of conflict and instability, this system has been greatly affected.
-The Joint project “Development of Juvenile System” aims at providing child-friendly access for all children in Libya in contact with the law, including those deprived of their liberty, in accordance with the UN Child Rights Convention (CRC), the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules), and the relevant international legal instruments.
-During the ceremony, Mr. Mahmoud Alsharif, head of Children Council noted in his/her opening statement that ""Imagine a child left his basic education 11 years ago and has a poor upbringing. This will expose themselves and others to risk. Therefore, there must be institutions and support programmes to protect this segment. It is the time, the time to start today and now. All partners are excited about this program. Our main goal is to save those children and serve their best interest.""
-Sandra Goffin, European Union Delegation to Libya Head of Operations, affirmed that “ The Rule of Law is one of the principles guiding the EU’s external action. All public authorities should always act within the constraints set out by law, in accordance with the values of democracy and fundamental rights, and under the control of independent and impartial courts. Through the joint project signed today, the EU is honored to have the possibility to support the efforts of Libyan authorities, in partnership with UN, to improve respect for the Rule of Law and application of international standards of juvenile justice.”
-From UNDP, the Deputy Resident Representative Mr. Christopher Laker stated: “The primary goals of developing the juvenile justice system in Libya is to maintain public safety, to support children in Libya with skills development, habilitation, rehabilitation, addressing treatment needs, and successful reintegration into the community. UNDP is proud to partner with Libyan authorities and the EU to help advance children’s safety and development in Libya.”
-“The launch of the Development of Juvenile Justice programme in Libya is a culmination of extensive efforts by the Government of Libya and different stakeholders including UN sister agencies to build a strong juvenile justice system in the country which is in line with the international standards,” said Ms. Cristina Brugiolo, Acting UNICEF Special Representative in Libya. “UNICEF believes in access to justice for every child, and I would like to thank the European Union in Libya for sharing this belief.”
-“Children in Libya deserve a child-friendly justice system that is tailored to their needs through the provision of basic needs, training of relevant personnel, enhancing the children’s living space and family visits area, providing reintegration and rehabilitation programmes, giving them another chance and more. This will be done through our joint project in collaboration with the State of Libya, relevant Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and partners,” Mr. Polleak Ok Serei, Head of the UNODC Office in Libya added in relation to the project’s importance.
-The “Development of Juvenile System” project is funded by the EU to support children in contact with the law in greater Tripoli and other selected locations, including those in detention, to have a child-friendly justice system. Some of the project’s targets will focus on supporting the development of relevant policies and coordination at the national level, improving access of families and children to tailored services accelerating the rehabilitation and reintegration of children, and enhancing pre-release planning and assistance programmes.

After more than a year of intense work in each municipality, which included stakeholder mapping and engagement, identification of needs and priorities, conducting strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, and preparing comprehensive costed lists of investment projects, the workshop was essential in providing the space for the participants to come together, exchange best practices and lessons learned, and agree on next steps to implement the plans.- -With ongoing guidance and support, the Task Forces met regularly to assess the needs, identify challenges and opportunities, among which water and power supply, housing, and clean energy, define a shared vision, and develop a road map for their municipality. Importantly, the road maps focus on locally-driven development, directly benefiting residents. ""We should really be focusing on local projects that benefit citizens, "" emphasised by Bani Walid's mayor, Dr. Alazoze. The plans are also designed to help municipalities to embark on a strategic, locally-led, medium-term development path, transition away from direct assistance towards self-sufficiency, and ensure greater sustainability at the local level. It is also a step towards reconciliation and peacebuilding.-At the national level, the development plans will help MoP advocate for establishing local planning and development support structures and enacting Law 59 on decentralisation of the administration system and subsequent by-laws and regulations. 
-The Task Forces will continue to work together to finalise the plans and present them to the local and national authorities for implementation in the coming months.

-“Digital technologies are driving new ways of working and thinking while opening-up opportunities that we could not have imagined,” says UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “For instance, it can assist policymakers to better understand how our natural world -- such as forests, coral reefs, or glaciers -- are changing in real-time and where to take action. Look at UNDP’s Data Futures Platform for example, it provides policymakers with the latest data and analytics to inform key areas like vaccine inequity.”
-UNDP is already supporting communities to develop and use digital technology to surface a wide range of much-needed development solutions. In the space of just one year, UNDP assisted 82 countries to adopt over 580 digital solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included everything from leveraging digital finance to facilitate cash transfers to people unable to leave their homes during lockdowns; to helping countries develop digital readiness assessments; to providing robots that are serving in COVID-19 wards.
-“Over the past year, demand has grown among our partners to provide strategic support on national-level digital transformation,” says Robert Opp, UNDP’s Chief Digital Officer. “At present, UNDP is supporting 35 countries on their digital transformation journey – a strong signal in the trust and confidence placed in our organization to provide the cutting-edge support needed.”
-The strategy will also help guide the organization in its efforts to tackle the emerging challenges associated with our new digital world. If left unchecked, digital technology can exacerbate existing inequalities and reinforce biases. And while some progress has been made in closing the digital divide, 2.9 billion people – mostly in developing countries, and mostly women, remain without access to the Internet. “We’re committed to a rights-based, whole-of-society approach to digital transformation that leaves no one behind. We want to make digital work for everyone, everywhere – this generation, and future ones,” added Robert Opp.
-The strategy outlines how UNDP will assist countries in reaping the benefits of digital technology with a three-pronged approach:
-·First, UNDP will amplify development outcomes by embedding digital into its work; experimenting with new approaches and tools, scaling promising solutions, and applying foresight to understand possible futures.
-·Second, it will support societies in their efforts to create more inclusive and resilient digital ecosystems, ensuring they are rights-based and leave no one behind.-· And third, UNDP will continue to transform and lead by example to meet current and future technological needs. That means prompting  #FutureSmartUNDP personnel to continue upgrading their digital skills and using data strategically – helping to future proof the organization.-UNDP will also engage with global and local businesses and entrepreneurs, academics, researchers, young people, and policymakers to foster collaboration around the responsible and sustainable use of technology. This necessary conversation will feed into the work of the UNDP Accelerator Labs network as it surfaces and scales up local development solutions – many of which are digital.-Anchored in the UN Secretary-General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and the framework presented in the Our Common Agenda report, the strategy complements the UN's global efforts to expand access to affordable broadband and enhance the digital capacity of key groups including women and people with disabilities – ultimately creating new opportunities like jobs while boosting human development.
-“This latest Digital Strategy demonstrates that UNDP will not stand still. With the Global Goals serving as our guiding stars, we are looking beyond the immediate horizon to help ensure digital futures for everyone,” added Achim Steiner.

The Ministry of Local Government, the Municipality of Sabratha, the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) inaugurated the Roman theatre in Sabratha recently renovated with the support from the EU.-In 2016, clashes within and around the archaeological site destroyed parts of this invaluable cultural heritage. The World Heritage Archaeological Site of Sabratha has a long and important history and has been inscribed to the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage List since 1982. The landmark was once a Phoenician trading-post that served as an outlet for the products of the African hinterland, and later Romanized and rebuilt in the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D. In modern times, the site serves as a landmark and symbol for all Libyans as well as a destination for tourists, locals and students who come from all parts of the country.-In cooperation with the Ministry of Local Government, the Department of Antiquity and UNESCO (through the International Council on Monuments and Sites – ICOMOS), UNDP provided support to the Municipality of Sabratha to restore the historical and non-historical buildings of the Roman Theatre. The restoration works consist of rehabilitation of service offices to manage the monuments, rehabilitation of the Roman theatre stage, maintenance, and improvement of three entrance gates, as well as installation of solar streetlights.-Sabratha Roman theatre is expected to attract around 500,000 visitors every year, generating critical economic activity and thousands of jobs.-This initiative is part of UNDP’s efforts, since 2017, to accompany public institutions, local governments, civil society, and communities to build peace and resilience in 65 municipalities throughout the country.-During the ceremony, Mr. Mohamed Alhasluk, Mayor of Sabratha stated: "" This place is a historic-millennia old site that needs maintenance for its sustainability. We are grateful to UNDP and other partners for their contribution including installation of solar streetlights and renovation of all facilities within this archaeological site. ""-Mr Mohamed Abouhalga, International Cooperation Advisor to the minister of Local Government affirmed: ""The historic city of Sabratha has been an umbrella of many civilizations. The support from international organizations to renovate this edifice is an indication of prevailing peace and the desire of Libyans to enjoy its dividends. The ministry of Local Government continues to work with international partners to enable municipalities to provide better services to their residents. ""
-Mr. Marc-André Franche, UNDP’s Resident Representative said: "" The Roman Theatre is a symbol of how common values and culture may unify communities and contribute to peace and reconciliation in Libya.  UNDP is proud to partner with Libyan authorities and the EU to help preserve the rich cultural heritage of the country as an essential pillar of recovery and development.,-Mr. José Antonio Sabadell, Ambassador of the European Union in Libya, stated: ""Libya’s shared cultural heritage has all the potential to become an important driver for sustainable development. Extraordinary archaeological sites like the Roman Theatre in Sabratha offer immense opportunities for the communities to create jobs and boost the local economy. The EU is glad to be able to contribute to the work of Libyan authorities and our partners in preserving Libya’s rich cultural heritage.""-On his part, Mr. Mohamed Aboageila, the Head of Sabratha Antiquity Office, declared: Renovation of the service offices including restoration plant will allow to restore coins artifacts and pottery pots. Grateful to partners for their interest in the city's cultural heritage.""-***-This project was implemented in the framework of the programme ""Managing mixed migration flows in Libya through expanding protection space and supporting local socioeconomic development"" financed by the North of Africa Window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The main objective of this programme is to comprehensively reinforce protection and resilience of migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya while supporting an improved migration management along the migration routes in the country.

The kick-off meeting of Phase 2 of the European Union-funded “Recovery, Stability and Socio-Economic Development in Libya – Baladiyati” programme was held today, at the El Andalous hotel in Tripoli.-Conceived as an opportunity for institutional representatives to meet and discuss objectives and plans towards strengthened cooperation in the South of Libya, the event was attended by Libyan Vice-President of the Presidential Council, H.E. Al Koni, the Libyan Vice-Prime Minister, H.E. Mohammed Abu Janah, the Minister of Local Governance, H.E.

Badr Eldin Sadig Altoumi, who chaired the event, welcomed participants and said: “The Ministry of Local Governance has been working closely with colleagues from municipal authorities in the South to identify major challenges and tackle them jointly, and we will continue to do so. Today’s event is further proof of our commitment to support all populations in Libya and provide them with the assistance that is needed, in cooperation with the European Union, the Italian Embassy and Baladiyati’s executing agencies.”-Building upon the successful results achieved by the three implementing agencies throughout Baladiyati Phase 1, which allowed for over 300 priority interventions in the sectors of health, education and water and sanitation (WASH) in 27 Libyan municipalities, Baladiyati Phase 2 relies on additional 26.2 million EUR of EU funding to foster basic services, sustainable economic development, and social cohesion in 15 municipalities in the South of Libya.-The Ambassador of the European Union to Libya, H.E. José Antonio Sabadell, said: “Functioning local administrations and efficient public services are key elements of Libya’s stabilization, peace and prosperity. At the heart of the EU’s Baladiyati programme stands thus a partnership with Libyan municipalities to improve basic services, create livelihood opportunities and strengthen social cohesion. Baladiyati will put a special emphasis on municipalities in Libya’s South, responding to the hardship and challenges many of the Southern municipalities have to face.”-The Italian Ambassador in Libya, H.E. Giuseppe Buccino, renewed Italy’s commitment to strengthen cooperation toward stability and improved welfare in the South of Libya, in line with the priorities of the Government of National Unity. H.E. Buccino said: “I am glad to be attending this event today, together with the Libyan Vice-President of the Presidential Council, the Minister of Local Governance, the representatives of the Minister of Planning, the EU Ambassador and the Mayors of the municipalities where Baladiyati’s Phase 2 will concentrate work. Today we are joining forces to improve livelihoods and public service delivery in the Southern region of the country and address the most pressing needs of the communities.

We are committed in promoting peace and stability in Fezzan, supporting the reconciliation efforts of Libyan Government and financing concrete intervention in different fields such as health, renewable energy and water.”-The AICS Head of Regional Office, Mr. Andrea Senatori, said: “Supporting local governance and strengthening the delivery of basic services to the Libyan population have been the main objectives of the Italian Cooperation in Libya. Since October 2018, Phase 1 of the Baladiyati programme has carried out over 300 priority interventions, contributing substantially to improved access to basic services and enhanced resilience for the most vulnerable communities in Libya. In Phase 2, AICS will continue boost dialogue and coordination with the Libyan Central and Local Authorities, the European Union and colleagues from UNDP and UNICEF to assess and deliver the needed support in the South of Libya.”-“UNDP is keen to increase its support in the southern region of Libya as a component of its resilience and peace building programme implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Local Government. In the second phase, the project will support local economic recovery, renewable energy and social cohesion as the building blocks for peace and sustainable development in the south of Libya. I look forward to continuing our partnership with Libyan institutions, the European Union, the Italian Cooperation and UNICEF, for Libyans to generate peace dividends and be strong drivers of recovery efforts for a more peaceful, united, and democratic country,” said the UNDP Resident Representative, Marc-André Franche.”-The Acting UNICEF Special Representative to Libya, Mr. Khaldoun Shakkour, expressed UNICEF’s continued commitment to leaving no one behind, noting that Phase 1 of the Programme had done much to open up the Southern region to comprehensive international support, stating that: “UNICEF welcomes this opportunity to deepen our engagement towards sustainable programming in Southern Libya in a way that meets our collective responsibility to assist communities to build back better.”-After the opening session, the European Union’s implementing partners AICS, UNDP and UNICEF took the floor to present Baladiyati’s Phase 2 scope and overall goals and engaged with participants in an open discussion on the shared vision toward quality basic services, community dialogue and livelihood opportunities for all in the South of the country.-Photos of the event can be downloaded here: https://bit.ly/3nZDf0m-For more information:-Carlotta Comparetti, AICS Communications Officer: carlotta.comparetti@aics.gov.it-Aml Barghuti, UNDP Communication Associate: aml.barghuti@undp.org- Suad Al Marani, UNICEF Communications Specialist: salmarani@unicef.org","['Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 17']","UNICEF,Arab states,Libya,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Arabic,UNEP,Press release,Sustainable development,Newsletter,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

In total, fifteen districts and 2 cities have been impacted, with the seven districts of Nsanje, Phalome, Chikwawa, Mangochi, Balaka, Chiradzulu, and Zomba hardest hit. -Based on Malawi’s Flood Response Plan, a coordinated emergency response is underway by the Government of Malawi, its UN partners, and NGOs to address immediate needs, particularly relating to water and sanitation, essential medicines and food assistance.   Ms. Claire Medina, interim UNDP Resident Representative, noted, “In partnership with the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), NGOs, and other UN partners, UNDP is supporting efforts to deliver effective early recovery interventions in parallel with the crisis response”.-As part of its Emergency Development Response to Crisis and Recovery (EDRCR) Funding Window, UNDP is providing US$500,000 to Malawi for early recovery interventions in response to Cyclone Idai.-Noting that most of the hardest hit districts in 2019 are the same that were severely impacted by heavy floods three years earlier in 2015, Ms. Medina said, “While ongoing efforts are rightly focused on immediate needs in affected communities, recovery can take months for those households whose lives and livelihoods have been severely disrupted.  Without more investments to build resilience to floods, which we know will increase in severity and frequency owing to climate change, communities will remain vulnerable to the steady erosion of their productive assets, deepening the cycle of poverty and putting at risk Malawi’s development gains”.  -Early recovery is a vital element of an effective humanitarian crisis response, serving as the foundation for building resilience in post-crisis transition.  Early recovery interventions will focus on emergency employment in affected communities to help clear debris, repair damaged infrastructure, restore basis services, and help households to build back better by making their houses more resilient to extreme weather events.-Initial assessments point to the need to rehabilitate vital community assets, such as irrigation systems and bridges, with further interventions to be identified during a post-disaster needs assessment which will be led by the Government of Malawi with its UN and other partners.-The early recovery activities will focus on livelihood-centric interventions to support the immediate economic recovery needs of affected communities, while strengthening the capacity of district authorities to support preparedness and recovery in affected communities.-UNDP funding from the EDRCR for early recovery in Malawi is made possible by contributions from Denmark, Germany, Luxemburg, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Slovak Republic, Sweden and Switzerland.-~ End ~-Media Contacts: UNDP Communications and Resource Mobilisation Analyst – Madalitso.mbendera@undp.org","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Malawi,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 13  Climate action,Crisis response,Press release,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

This has been done with the primary objective of developing baseline and target indicators to track progress on socioeconomic interventions at the regional and district level,” said Komatsubara.-In his remarks, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Hon. Sosten Alfred Gwengwe, MP said the report is a good reference document for stakeholders in the development space as it outlines how decentralization and good governance at a district-level contribute to long term sustainable development.-“The current version of the Malawi National Human Development Report is unique in the sense that, for the first time, the report has separately calculated district-level human development indices that capture spatial differences in the level of human development across districts, cities and regions,” said Minister Gwengwe.-The 7th Malawi National Human Development Report analyses how local governance structures influence both decision making and development processes and has drawn lessons and made recommendations for enhancing the local governance systems to accelerate this local level development.-The report also advocates for improvements in the socio-economic well-being of the people by implementing development interventions in local government areas where most of its people live while achieving equal opportunities for and active participation by all.-In general, the report advocates and highlights three key messages on decentralization and good governance. It highlights on delivering services and promoting sustainable development more effectively and efficiently. It advocates on giving people a voice to actively participate in the development process of their country in a more inclusive way.

The 2019 Cyclone Idai affected more than 865,000 people including more than 86,980 displaced, with 59 deaths and 672 injuries.-On the 24 of January 2022, Malawi experienced yet another disaster when the Tropical Storm Ana struck Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi, with high winds and torrential rains, leaving at least 80 people dead across the borders.-According to the latest situation report from the Government of Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA), more than 945,727 people have been affected, including close to 100,000 displaced, with 37 deaths and 158 injuries.- Tropical Storm Ana has severely affected communities that were already suffering due to the ongoing rainy season and the effects of Cyclone Idai in 2019.-Whilst ongoing efforts are focusing on immediate needs in affected communities, the current situation calls for more investments that will ensure long-lasting impact to minimize the effects of future floods.-UNDP Malawi is currently working with Government, under the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, in providing technical assistance to help strengthen the current coordination efforts and ensure that there are robust recovery mechanisms in place.-To help reduce the threats posed by climate change and natural disasters UNDP Malawi continues to work alongside the Government and other national and local structures, to help build capacity of key actors to improve early warnings and climate information, to enhance the resilience of affected communities.-In its disaster risk management work, UNDP Malawi has invested a complementary US$10 million to promote the resilience of communities, amongst which includes the construction of Evacuation Centres and developing Information Management Systems and Mechanisms aimed at strengthening the humanitarian coordination for timely response to the affected populations.-UNDP has also invested in the Inclusive Recovery Project, with financial support from the Government of Japan and the Government of the People’s Republic of China, aimed at preventing affected communities from slipping back to extreme vulnerability, and to strengthen their resilience by building back better.  Through this project, UNDP has constructed a total of 400 Climate resilient houses, rehabilitated damaged infrastructure and provided training to various players on how to build back better.-With support from Green Climate Fund (GCF), UNDP Malawi also invested in 16 million USSD, to help scale up the use of modernized early warning systems and climate information, with lifesaving early warnings, and dissemination of valuable climate information to help save lives, protect livelihoods, and inform decision-making on development plans.-In his remarks, the UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Shigeki Komatsubara said: “Our goal is to have permanent and sustainable solutions that address the threats posed by natural disasters like Tropical Storm Ana. We are therefore calling for more players and donors to invest in sustainable solutions in addressing natural disasters that helps us protect the significant development gains already made this far”.- With more than half of the 28 districts in Malawi being deemed as disaster prone, working to address the challenges that are inflated by a lack of preparedness, recovery capacity, limited early warning systems and the effects of climate change, is therefore key.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Malawi,Goal 1  No poverty,Disaster risk management,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,News,Multimedia,Resilient recovery,Disaster recovery,In the news,Goal 13  Climate action,Damage and loss,Early warning,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Through the Growth Accelerator Tourism Entrepreneurship Challenge; business owners in tourism have launched various initiatives in Nkhotakota, Dzalanyama, NkhataBay and many more to promote domestic tourism in their local districts. The programme also aims to support value chain revival, employee retention and Eco-tourism through the selected entrepreneurs. Eight other entrepreneurs were supported with up to USD40,000 in financing to promote domestic tourism. To know more about the Growth Accelerator Malawi programme, visit: www.growmalawi.com-Over the last twenty years, focus has been on international tourism marketing with little regard on the impacts of the domestic market.1 Growth Accelerator saw an opportunity to work with local tourism entrepreneurs that have innovative ideas, products and services that will amplify local tourist destinations. Pakachere Lodge and Creative Center is one such ventures that promoted Zomba City as a tourist destination for local people through the Zomba City Festival. With support from Growth Accelerator Malawi Pakachere is re-branding as a business that embodies the spirit of Zomba championing tourism, publicity and conservation of Zomba’s nature and history.-Zomba City Festival is an annual festival that aims to put Zomba on the map for local and international tourism to promote the history and natural vegetation of the city. Zomba City is a historical destination with breathtaking vegetation and scenery. Zomba City Festival was a collaborative effort of: Pakachere Lodge and Creative Center; Zomba Arts Platform; Zomba Tourism Association; TREES; WESM; Lodges in Zomba and Zomba City Council. The festival was a three-day city wide extravaganza hosted in eight different venues and featured activities such as: Musical performances; Mountain Hike; Yoga; Art in the park; Poetry; Coffee Tasting and Book Fairs; E-gaming; Family Fun park; fashion and theater showcases and a treasure hunt. The event was patronized by locals from several districts such as Blantyre, Mangochi, Lilongwe, NkhataBay to mention a few.-Pakachere played a significant role in the success of the Zomba City Festival. With support from Growth Accelerator Malawi the lodge and creative center was able to construct a multipurpose stage and barbecue yard. This made Pakachere the main venue for musical and theater performances. Pakachere also hosted yoga and other recreational activities on the stage. In addition, the center donated office space for the planning team to organize the festival. Pakachere also lead the city clean up and litter picking in Zomba City during the festival.-Beyond the Zomba City Festival, Pakachere intends to continue using its stage and barbecue area to host various recreational and creative events such as: dance recitals, poetry shows, theater, weddings, yoga and other recreational activities. They hope to use the stage to promote local talent and venue for events in the city. For Pakachere their main motivation to support Zomba City Festival is to: firstly, raise awareness on the conservation efforts to protect Zomba Mountain and its vegetation; secondly, continue to work collaboratively with other businesses in Zomba to promote the city as a tourism destination; and promote art, local talent and Zomba’s history. In the future the Festival plans to lobby for a museum, an education center in the Zomba Botanic Garden; and fine art gallery. They plan to partner with the Chancellor College’s Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts; and continue to promote local talent in Malawi.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Malawi,Goal 1  No poverty,In the news,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,News,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production, targets on substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, and recycling of all waste, by 2030.-Malawi has been facing several challenges in waste management, with City Councils managing only 12% of the waste, and the private waste collectors working to fill the gap. Furthermore, the limited coordination between waste generators (households and institutions), waste collectors and recyclers also exacerbate the challenges.-To help strengthen Malawi’s waste management in cities and district councils, UNDP through its Accelerator Lab collaborated with the City of Yokohama and Malawi’s City Councils on a two-day webinar to exchange expertise on sustainable waste management.-“Major cities in Malawi are challenged by the accumulation of waste due to rapid increase in the urban population and limited resources that are available for public service delivery”, observed Shamiso Najira, Deputy Director of Environmental Affairs under Malawi’s Ministry of Forestry and Natural Resources, in her opening remarks.-With over 60 participants from both the public and private sector, representatives from Yokohama shared their experiences on key activities and initiatives undertaken by the city since its existence.-The City of Yokohama highlighted the importance of having a robust systems approach, which leads to the reduction of waste amount and waste management cost. The city started developing waste treatment facilities and expanding waste collection in the 1970s ‘Mass Consumption Age’, when Japan experienced an explosive economic growth, with rapid urbanization and increase in population growth rate which created challenges for the city, as the amount of waste skyrocketed.-Some of the key lessons shared with the participants on Japan’s success also included: citizens’ cooperation in maintaining cleanliness in the city; proactively engaging the public to promote the 3R Policy (Reduce, Re-use and Recycle); importance of sorting waste at source which is crucial in household waste management; sensitization of the public on conducting appropriate household waste management; and how the city makes use of its landfill sites and incineration plants.-In his remarks, the Resident Representative of UNDP Malawi, Shigeki Komatsubara said, “Water and Sanitation are critical components of the SDGs and Malawi’s 2063 vision. Waste management is not only reducing waste but also reusing and recycling waste. Simply put, there is no waste to be wasted. I am very happy that our team is now working with friends in Malawi on such critical part of Malawian lives, in partnership with the City of Yokohama”.-Commenting on the sessions, Wasili Mfungwe, Head of Exploration for UNDP Malawi’s AccLab indicated how the Lab anticipates a lot more collaboration as they experiment on solutions aimed at sustainable waste management for the country.-“It was great to learn that the City of Yokohama took a similar trajectory that Malawi Cities are currently taking.  There were interesting insights on how communities were involved at the design of plans to do with waste, which enhanced implementation”, said Wasili.-In their testimonies to the event, one of the participants remarked; “It is amazing how the Yokohama G30 plan and the adoption of 3R policy triggered a reduction in waste and landfill waste.  Citizen education on sorting is instrumental”.-UNDP Accelerator Lab Malawi is the only Lab in Africa selected alongside four others, working on circular economy to implement the Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge for UNDP Accelerator Labs with support from the Office of the Cabinet of Japan. The innovation challenge projects allowed collaboration of Accelerator Labs with partner local governments, private firms and academia in Japan.  The City of Yokohama, which is also a host of Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) Summits in Japan, has been identified as the main Japanese partner for the project. In Malawi-The current partnership builds on a long standing partnership between Malawi - Japan - UNDP; as well as the support from Yokohama through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to Lilongwe Water Board, to support the better management of the water system for the City of Lilongwe.-The Acclab in Malawi will continue the dialogue with stakeholders to work towards finding solutions to challenges in Waste Management in Malawi with key initiatives in engaging communities/households to sort waste at source, City Master Planning, Recycling and Waste Collection.-","['Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Malawi,In the news,Blog post,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,News,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,Accelerator Labs"

Even though Malawi has made progress in improving essential health services, there are still many gaps and challenges that need to be addressed. Management of medical supplies is one of those – that if managed well, can positively impact the wellbeing of people within the health facilities-However, managing medical supplies can be a tiresome task for health workers, including filling forms that take hours to complete and delivering them to the relevant authorities. To expedite and simplify this process, Malawi’s Ministry of Health and UNDP have adopted a new system to improve medical supply chain management and accountability of medicines and other medical supplies in the country.-This can only be possible through complete visibility into the supply chain system from central warehouses to the patients that consume these commodities.-The system is called the Electronic Health Information Network System (Ehin). Ehin allows doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other Health Care Workers to track medicines from the Central Medical Stores Trust up to the end-user. The system applies mobile technology to collect and transmit data in real-time. Thereby, simplifying the process for health care workers to report on health commodities in stock and in need of resupply.-Health workers will be given a username and password to access the system. Ministry of Health officials will know who has accessed the system, and changes made each time. Health Workers that have undergone this training have been given smartphones to use to access the system.-Ehin is being rolled out in Ntchisi, Blantyre and Rumphi and will be expanded to all health facilities and bridging the information gap between facilities and patients.-So far, 680 health workers from the three districts have been trained on how to use the system when ordering and dispensing medical supplies. Ministry of Health, with support from UNDP, organized hands-on training where participants were given access to the system and taken through all the steps to order and dispense medical supplies.-The Director of Health Technical Support Services in the Ministry of Health, Godfrey Kadewere, said it’s time the ministry embraced technology to improve supply chain management so that everyone benefits from it. He said the Ministry has been struggling with stockouts, diversions of medicine, and drug theft.  -He said Ministry of Health needs a strong supply chain management that is seamless from top to bottom to track down medical supplies.-“Ehin will address the gap that was there within the supply chain management. With coming of the system, everyone will be able to go into the system and monitor what is happening. When I am sitting in my office, I should be able to log in into the system and access information for each health facility”. Said Mr. Kadewere.-Mr. Kadewere further added that the system will improve accountability, transparency, expiry of medicines and reduce stockouts. This will improve patient satisfaction, improving health outcomes in the process.-Frankson Chibwato is one of the health workers who has been trained and has started using the Ehin System. He works as a Drug Store Clerk at Chinguluwe Health Centre in Ntchisi.-Concurring with the Director of Health Technical Support Services, Chibwato said Ehin is a system that will reduce unethical practices since everyone who has rights can access it to track medicines from District Health Offices, facilities up to Village Health Clinics.-“The system will be able to detect and show disparities thereby improving service delivery. There will be trust between health workers and community members now. At first, they thought we are lying or stealing when we tell them there are no commodities. But the system will improve all this”.-Chibwato added that the system has also improved teamwork. Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacists and Drug Store Clerks can work together and are able to share information leading to effective treatment of patients thus improving service delivery.-Health Workers in areas with limited connectivity will still be able to access and enter data offline. Once connected to a network, the data will automatically be updated.-This technology has emerged as an opportunity to improve service delivery and patient satisfaction. Districts Hospitals will be able to plan and ensure they have everything they need.-The Ehin system is expected to be rolled out to all districts.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Malawi,In the news,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Access and delivery,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,English"

In areas where public service delivery is functional most of us see no need to make changes. In one of my early solutions mapping trips, when I asked one group village headman in a remote area north of Malawi, why he came up with the innovation he was showing us, he had looked at me, paused a bit and said “Poverty. When you are poor you look for ways to make life bearable”. I looked back at him, feeling chastened, followed as he went ahead to show us the rest of his innovation. What I was seeing reminded me of a similar innovation we had seen a few days back in the south of the country;   a wind turbine like the one created by Malawi’s famous “Boy who Harnessed the Wind”. The set-up of both innovations made me question safety, efficacy, reliability, sustainability, and at that moment I wished I were seeing something cleaner, and more appealing, and identifiable.-Different yet so similar-The Mini-grid: Richard Mhango Ngulukira, a group village headman in Nkhata Bay learnt how to install a hydroelectric power system from his cousin who lives in a nearby village. Ngulukira got his first motor from his cousin in 2013 and proceeded to install the system in his own village. He explained how he had used scrap material to install the whole system – the wires, extension, pipes and motor cost him about USD106 using savings over time.-He can generate 240 watts which allows lighting of 7 bulbs, listening to the radio and watching TV in his home. From the river where he taps the power, Ngulukira has connected 10 other households (for free) including grocery stores in the village that are able to operate until evening.-The Wind Turbine: George Kalichero is a young man who finished his secondary school education with credits too low for University admission. Living at a tea estate with his parents in Mulanje, one of the remote districts in the country, there isn’t much to do. George dreams and innovates, his curiosity of how things work has led him to create prototypes and test his innovations.-Five years back while visiting an aunt in the city, he got fascinated one day by a thing that looked like a magnetic motor. It was swept from inside the house and was meant to be thrown in the trash. Two years later, George had produced a windmill from scrap metal, bicycle parts and a used car battery, powering 3 houses in his compound.-Relatives and friends are using the generated power for lighting as well as charging phones. His sister who is still in school studies in the evenings because the house has light. George says the windmill could do more, only that the batteries that save the power are too small and he has no money to buy bigger batteries. Like Ngulukira, over time through savings, he has spent ~USD94 on the innovation.-George plans to find environmentally sustainable alternatives for building the windmill tower, to make it stronger and easily replicated without causing environmental degradation. One of his options is to turn plastic waste into durable thick pipes that can be used to build the tower.-Unmet needs and value addition-Talking to both innovators, each confirmed their biggest motivator was their situation and the desire “to find answers” and “to create change”. Although George being curious and young showed willingness to explore and refine his innovation, Ngulukira being older is satisfied with his system since “it’s working perfectly meeting his needs and the needs of others”.-It made me think of how we determine if a solution needs to be refined or scaled. Most grassroot innovators do not care about the frugality of the solution, only its function.  Care must be exercised when we come in with expert eyes tinkering on the solution.  How we add value to the solution equally matters for replication and adoption by similar communities. As Honey Bee Network’s Professor Anil Gupta has said, “you can add value to form, feature or function of a solution”, but getting the formula right requires humility, collaboration, recognizing the innovators’ role and sensitivity to community needs and values.-Getting country office programming teams involved-Mini grids have been estimated by the International Energy Agency as the best solution for over a third of the global population currently living without electricity access. We have involved the UNDP Malawi’s Access to Energy project team to fund, provide expertise and collaborate with Government into exploring opportunities for refining and scaling these innovations, so that they are compliant to quality, safety and environmental standards for sustainability [more in the next blog].-Providing energy access to people currently living without it by 2030 demands new and innovative solutions for rural electrification and we are committed to find the right formula.","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Malawi,Solutions Mapping,Blog post,Goal 13  Climate action,News,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Accelerator Labs,Landscape"

Each group reframed the category into a Point of View question to define the problem being solved using “How Might We [do an action] [on what] for [which stakeholder] in order to [change something]” structure.-Ideation and Prototyping Solutions-The groups used sticky notes to brainstorm as many ideas as they could come up with in a specified time before clustering them on a flipchart board. From the clusters, they picked their top three ideas and reviewed how much impact they would have versus how much effort they would require to implement. With a preference for high-impact low-effort ideas, each group picked their best idea which they prototyped, pitched to all participants and developed a work plan for. The five best ideas from the groups were:-Next Steps-We were amazed at the diversity of ideas the groups came up with during the workshop. By using tools, methods and knowledge of various individuals and institutions from various sectors, we brainstormed, reviewed and co-designed potential solutions to waste management issues in the city of Lilongwe. We thank everyone who has directly and indirectly contributed to finding solutions that will uplift the lives of those affected by unmanaged waste in Lilongwe and beyond.-The journey of addressing waste management challenges is not yet over for the UNDP Malawi Accelerator Lab team.

The tendency for risk aversion was well emphasized by one study participant who noted that she ""would rather pay more for a safer energy source because if I get into an accident while cooking, I will have to spend more"".- -Context, justification, relevance-There is evidence of the contribution of energy access in reducing poverty. Especially improved, clean, and safe energy has been linked with better human health, increased income-generating activities, and improving the situation for women. However, in many cases, the energy sources available for low-income households lacks several of these characteristics and are unreliable. Even when improved energy sources can be easily acquired in the market, the uptake is lower than it would be expected.-Take the example of Mozambique where there is heavy dependance on biomass. Approximately 75% of Mozambican households rely on charcoal and firewood for cooking. However, due to population growth, prices of biomass have hiked. In recent years, the fastest growing cities of Mozambique (Maputo, Beira & Nampula), for instance, have seen such a growth in the consumption of charcoal that the prices increased by more than 200% in some instances. This raises three concerns for low-income families, biomass availability, access, and high cost of energy.-Betting in energy diversification seems like an obvious solution but such has not been seen. One previous study even remarkably noted that in major cities where liquified petroleum gas (LPG), electricity, and biomass are all readily available, energy preferences remain unchanged and heavily dependent on charcoal across different income levels although the monthly cost of using LPG for example is only half of charcoal. This dichotomy is what set UNDP Mozambique Accelerator Lab out to explore questions around energy choices, preferences, and adoption. We focused on uptake of LPG.-
-Figure 1. Distribution of energy use in major urban areas.
- -Methodological approach
-Initial investment is drastically different between charcoal and LPG. Charcoal only requires a stove, while anyone intending to use LPG must first acquire a cylinder, hose, reductor, and stove. Hence, when the lab started, we assumed that initial investment was a plausible reason for low uptake of LPG among our target group. But the accelerator lab wanted to look beyond the numbers (investment) and explore other factors that could affect energy choices.-We designed a 5-day interactive workshop comprised of 6 exercises and invited 105 people to share their experience and perspective anonymously. The workshop started off with a yes or no survey of knowledge, beliefs, and biases about LPG. Then followed a survey of participants profiles including energy access, consumption, and expenditures. In the third exercise participants were asked to choose from 4 hypothetical energy sources which were made of combinations of 4 attributes (initial investment, minimum purchase quantity, safety, and distance from home to place of purchase). The intention was to identify the most crucial factor in energy choice among those attributes. The participants then responded to two sequences of willingness-to-pay (WTP): WTP for initial LPG investment, and WTP for services that could increase convenience (home delivery) or facilitate purchase by those with low liquidity (installment pay). The final set was resource allocation among 7 different energy products or services. This is a what if exercise where we eliminated the individuals’ resource constraints to gamify home resource allocation and observe allocation among energy options.- -1-Initial investment-500 MT-Minimum purchase quantity-At least enough to cook for 1 week-Safety-You are at risk of 1 incident or minor accident every 3 months-Distance from home to place of purchase-1 hour walking distance-2-Minimum purchase quantity-At least enough to cook for 1 month- -Initial investment-3200 MT-Distance from home to place of purchase-15 to 30 minutes walking distance-Safety-You are at risk of 1 incident or minor accident per year-3-Safety-You are at risk of 1 incident or minor accident every 6 months-Distance from home to place of purchase-<15 minutes walking distance-Initial investment-5000 MT-Minimum purchase quantity-At least enough to cook for 2 weeks-4-Distance from home to place of purchase-30 to 45 minutes walking distance-Safety-You are at risk of 1 incident or accident per month-Minimum purchase quantity-At least enough to cook for 1 day-Initial investment-1850 MT-Table 1: Four hypothetical energy sources considered under a choice experiment
- -The main results from the workshop-The theme that emerged in the several exercises and then in the focus group discussions that followed was safety. In the choice exercise (exercise 3) this appeared especially strong. Here over 90% of participants choose the hypothetical energy that posed relatively less risk of an accident for the users even though although it was the second most expensive, and it ranked second in accessibility. Several participants justified their choice by reasoning that they were actually minimizing health care costs. Based on focus groups, and perception survey we learned that LPG is largely seen as unsafe and an energy source that requires far more skills and knowledge to use safely than say charcoal.-Other result that was notably interesting came from WTP and resource allocation. The workshop participants were 65% people whose household income was between 3000,00 MT and 15000,00 MT (47USD and 237 USD), the equivalent to about 1 to 5 minimum salaries. But they were willing to pay on average about 2800,00 MT for a new 4.5kg gas cylinder and 2500,00 MT for a two-burner gas stove. Willingness to pay for a contract for future installment pay of LPG cylinders was higher than any other service but participants were also willing to pay for other services like home delivery. On the resource allocation we also observed participants putting considerable resources towards the same services, LPG initial investment, and cylinder refill.- -Beliefs and behavior patterns to increase adoption of LPG-We have only just scratched the surface on explaining why people in a developing country especially those with low incomes don’t take up alternative energy sources. As the Accelerator Lab Mozambique investigated LPG as a point of reflection, we recognized that the initial investment in LPG remains unaffordable for many people. But our exploration suggests that we may need to ponder beliefs and behavior patterns to increase adoption of LPG. The lab is now designing a portfolio of experiments based on these findings and is proposing to test different business models like installment pays, community training on safety, subsidy for initial LPG kit purchase, home-delivery, and behavioral components to increase safety.",['Icon of SDG 07'],"Africa,Social Network Analysis,Blog post,Energy access,Mozambique,Energy efficiency,News,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Accelerator Labs,English"

-The project is divided into four phases of implementation, namely: (i) development of the pgr's procedural management system; (ii) development of SERNIC'S procedural management system; (iii) development of the information reconciliation system; (iv) integration of information systems and training of technicians. With regard to the results, the system    expects (i) to utomatize and uniformize theinformation station of periodic and monthly analytical reports between theinstitutions, (ii) ensure that information is accessible in a timely manner, following the safety criteria pre-established by the institutions for the protection of information, and (iii) gradually decrease the redundancy of information as a result of duplication and errors. With the inchronics of the two systems it is expected that the level of differences in statistical results between the two institutions will decrease exponentially. -Background-In carrying out the activities of control and management of criminal proceedings between PRG and SERNIC, the identification and qualification of information are extremely relevant and decisive in the effectiveness of planning and strategy, driving an objective decision-making. Considering the complexity of this activity and the increasing flow of process information, the implementation of a controlled information sharing system is a fundamental boost in the objectifying of planned strategic results.-It is in this context that there is a need to automate the management of the process information shared between the PGR and SERNIC, ensuring, among other things, the reduction of the statistical discrepancy of procedural information, the prevention of redundancy d and information during the life cycle of proceedings between the institutions and the implementation of the inform procedural action.",[],"News,Press release,In the news"

That could result in as much as 25 million people - nearly half of Myanmar’s population - living below the national poverty line by early 2022, a level of impoverishment not seen in the country since 2005.-The analysis indicates that, by the end of 2020, 83 per cent of households had reported that their incomes had been, on average, slashed almost in half due to the pandemic. With these unprecedented circumstances, the number of people living below the poverty line in Myanmar is estimated to have increased by 11 percentage points as a result of the socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis.-And according to the projections outlined in the report, the worsening security, human rights, and development situation in Myanmar since February 2021 could cause another sharp rise in the country’s poverty rate – driving it up by an additional 12 percentage points by early next year.-“In the space of 12 years, from 2005 to 2017, Myanmar managed to nearly halve the number of people living in poverty. However, the challenges of the past 12 months have put all of these hard-won development gains at risk,” said UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “Without functioning democratic institutions, Myanmar faces a tragic and avoidable backslide towards levels of poverty not seen in a generation.”-According to the study, women and children are projected to bear the heaviest brunt, with more than half of Myanmar’s children projected to be living in poverty within a year.-Urban poverty is expected to triple, and the worsening security conditions have continued to fracture supply chains and hinder the movement of people, services, and commodities including the provision of agricultural goods. Small businesses, which provide the majority of jobs and incomes for the poorer segments of the urban population, have been hit hard.-The pressure on the country’s currency, the Kyat, has increased the price of imports and energy. At the same time, the country’s banking system remains paralyzed, resulting in shortages of cash and limited access to social welfare payments. It also prevents much-needed remittances from reaching hard-pressed families.-“We are witnessing a compounding crisis of unprecedented severity and complexity. Myanmar had managed to halve poverty, and with its democratic transition was showing signs of firming up fragile human development gains. Now it feels like a push-back to 2005. The combined effects of COVID-19 and the political crisis have caused a systemic shock which could lead to a long-lasting disruption in Myanmar’s development trajectory, unless addressed and resolved soon,” said Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific.-As the situation in Myanmar continues to worsen, UNDP joins the United Nations Secretary-General in condemning, in the strongest terms, the killing of civilians, and in calling for a firm, unified and resolute international response to the crisis.-Read the report in english-Read the report in Burmese-Infographic","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,Myanmar,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 2  Zero hunger"

 New York, 16 December 2020 – The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won’t be the last, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which includes a new experimental index on human progress that takes into account countries’ carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint.-The report lays out a stark choice for world leaders - take bold steps to reduce the immense pressure that is being exerted on the environment and the natural world, or humanity’s progress will stall.-“Humans wield more power over the planet than ever before. In the wake of COVID-19, record- breaking temperatures and spiraling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.-“As this report shows, no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without putting immense strain on the planet. But we could be the first generation to right this wrong. That is the next frontier for human development,” he said.-The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time to for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.-To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).-By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress.-With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress. For example, more than 50 countries drop out of the very high human development group, reflecting their dependence on fossil fuels and material footprint while countries like Costa Rica, Moldova, and Panama move upwards by at least 30 places, recognizing that lighter pressure on the planet is possible.-While Myanmar marginally improved its HDI rank to 147 in 2019 from 148 in 2018, out of 189 countries and territories, when measured against PHDI, it moved up by 3 places with 0.9 percent lower score than its HDI in the latest report.-“The Human Development Report is an important product by the United Nations. In a time where action is needed, the new generation of Human Development Reports, with greater emphasis on the defining issues of our time such as climate change and inequalities, helps us to steer our efforts towards the future we want,” said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, host country of the launch of the report.-The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.-For example, new estimates project that by 2100 the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather due to climate change each year- a number that could be cut in half if the Paris Agreement on climate change is fully implemented.-And yet fossil fuels are still being subsidized: the full cost to societies of publicly financed subsidies for fossil fuels - including indirect costs - is estimated at over US$5 trillion a year, or 6.5 percent of global GDP, according to International Monetary Fund figures cited in the report.-“Development choices of the past have systematically undervalued the environment, posing human progress and sustainability as conflicting pursuits” said Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific.-Reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. While Myanmar’s planetary pressures are relatively low, the country has nevertheless recognized the need to address negative externalities of its economic development path including through the 10-year “Myanmar Reforestation and Rehabilitation Programme launched in 2018 to address some types of deforestation and forest degradation, said Dawn Del Rio, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP, Myanmar.-How people experience planetary pressures is tied to how societies work, says Pedro Conceição, Director of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office and lead author of the report, and today, broken societies are putting people and planet on a collision course.-Inequalities within and between countries, with deep roots in colonialism and racism, mean that people who have more capture the benefits of nature and export the costs, the report shows. This chokes opportunities for people who have less and minimizes their ability to do anything about it.-For example, land stewarded by indigenous peoples in the Amazon absorbs, on a per person basis, the equivalent carbon dioxide of that emitted by the richest 1 percent of people in the world. However, indigenous peoples continue to face hardship, persecution and discrimination, and have little voice in decision-making, according to the report.-And discrimination based on ethnicity frequently leaves communities severely affected and exposed to high environmental risks such as toxic waste or excessive pollution, a trend that is reproduced in urban areas across continents, argue the authors.-According to the report, easing planetary pressures in a way that enables all people to flourish in this new age requires dismantling the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of transformation.-The Government of Myanmar through the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (2018-2030) has committed itself to a climate-sensitive development pathway. Subsequently, this has been complemented by the recently launched new National Environmental Policy and Myanmar Climate Change Policy in 2019. Cumulatively, the policy commitments have set out a vision for Myanmar as a climate-resilient, low-carbon society for the well-being of present and future generations which now need to be operationalized systematically. In this regard, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, State Counsellor of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, in her statement made recently at the virtual Climate Ambition Summit, has reiterated Myanmar’s commitment to submit its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by the end of 2020 and highlighted the targeted reduction of over 243 million tons of CO2 by increasing the share of renewable energy to 39% and reducing the net emission from the forestry sector by 25%.-Public action, the report argues, can address these inequalities, with examples ranging from increasingly progressive taxation, to protecting coastal communities through preventive investment and insurance, a move that could safeguard the lives of 840 million people who live along the world’s low elevation coastlines. But there must be a concerted effort to ensure that actions do not further pit people against planet.-To learn more about the 2020 Human Development report and UNDP’s analysis on the experimental Planetary Pressures-Adjusted HDI, visit http://hdr.undp.org/en/2020-report-###-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Yangon, Myanmar-Promising young tech entrepreneurs are stepping up and driving Myanmar’s digital transformation toward a new phase. Today’s virtual Demo Day event, hosted by “Innovation Hub – supporting the SDGs,” presented a total of six digital innovations created by Myanmar’s talented tech startups, namely five winning teams and one runner-up team from the 2019 Hackathon organized jointly by UNDP and Ooredoo Myanmar.-Today’s virtual Demo Day event was indeed a much-awaited debut stage for these young tech startups who aced the national competition and then successfully completed the Innovation Hub’s intensive training and mentoring programme in addition to volunteering their services for the Innovation Hub’s COVID-19 collaborations amongst other initatives such as Myanmar’s digital celebration of the 2020 World Environment Day. During the joint Ooredoo-UNDP Hackathon in 2019, the cohorts started creating prototypes of their digital solutions to address pressing challenges Myanmar is facing, i.e., climate change, education and rural development, while helping achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), e.g., Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being and Goal 5: Gender Equality.-Their journey in the pursuit of digital innovation in the midst of COVID-19 outbreak, has not been easy. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the services of the Innovation Hub were moved online including the incubation and mentoring sessions as well as its Tech 101 digital webinar series. The temporary closure affected the cohorts’ access to the Innovation Hub’s co-working space, technical support and business networks.-However, the Innovation Hub’s digital events continued to amplify youth voices and provide platforms for the youth to engage in policy dialogue. U Kyaw Zin Hted, COO of the 2019 Hackathon Winning Team “Innovatory” whose mobile app “Sein” was highlighted today, in fact, participated earlier this year as a youth representative in the virtual panel discussion to celebrate World Environment Day 2020.-The six digital innovations presented today showcase the potential to accelerate both digital transformation and sustainable development of Myanmar. Team TweeTwee’s TweeBot and Team Garage’s Mentiply are set up to digital solutions for quality education which are made even more relevant in the COVID-19 context; Team AgriLight’s de4up and Team Glorius’s Sein Lan provide digital access to finance and market for rural development; Team Innovatory’s Sein seeks to promote Myanmar’s green e-commerce platform; and Team F’s Clinic One provides digital health services.-Mr. Alok Verma, Chief Commercial Officer of Ooredoo Myanmar said “In a time where digital transformation is driving change in all areas, Myanmar youth have a tremendous potential to use digital technologies to shape Myanmar’s brighter future. We are proud to give Myanmar youth all possible opportunities to develop their full potential to build Myanmar as a digital nation and keep abreast of the changing world. Ooredoo is empowering the youth of Myanmar through new innovative digital knowledge, service, products and future plans to support Myanmar’s digital transformation. We, at Ooredoo, are and will be dedicated to delivering social initiatives in Myanmar to fulfill the vision of “enriching people’s digital lives”.-“UNDP knows that Myanmar’s youth can make the difference in helping Myanmar to build back better using digital technologies to transform how Myanmar does business across the public and private sector to deliver on the SDGs.. We hope that the today’s virtual demonstrations serve to inspire the talented youth to apply their talent to participate and promote Myanmar’s digital innovation efforts to accelerate SDGs and helping to reach underserved areas while leaving no one behind said Dawn Del Rio, Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP Myanmar.-Today’s Demo Day represents the conclusion of the 2019 Hackathon journey, under the overall umbrella of the productive partnership between Ooredoo Myanmar and UNDP.-“Innovation Hub - supporting the SDGs” is a co-working space for youths and tech entrepreneurs to showcase, scale up and collaborate on innovative ideas to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through digital innovation.-“The Hackathon” is a special initiative of Ooredoo Myanmar and UNDP Myanmar to promote and scale up digital innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the youth in Myanmar through a combination of challenge and business incubation. It aims to provide a platform for Myanmar’s youth to create prototypes that showcase innovative ideas to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through digital innovation.-For more information, contact:-Ooredoo Communication Team | +959 9733 33322 | czar@oredoo.com.mm

It is a great pleasure and an honour to share today with you, and to be invited to speak on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme.-2020 has been an exceptionally difficult year for all of us. It has been a time of uncertainty and anxiety, and sadly one of tragedy, disruption and loss for many people. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us just how vulnerable we all are, and how quickly everything can change. And, as is so often the case, it is people already in situations of great hardship who have been worst affected – the people living in remote and conflict-affected communities, people living in poverty and struggling with unemployment, marginalised groups and individuals already at the edge of society.-I wish to dedicate my remarks to the people, families and communities across Myanmar who continue to suffer terribly during COVID-19, and to the medical workers, civil society organisations, community and religious leaders, and government officials who have been working tirelessly to help and support them, often at their own great risk.-International Human Rights Day celebrates the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today the Declaration is 72 years old, but in the midst of a global pandemic, see can see that it’s more important now than ever before. True to the message of the Declaration, COVID-19 has shown us just how connected and reliant we all are on each other. And the people of Myanmar are renowned for their generosity and understand this.-Article 1 of the Declaration says that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. And article 2 goes on to say that everyone is entitled to rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind.-Dignity, equality and non-discrimination form the heart of the Declaration. And in turn, they are the foundations of strong, rich, diverse and united communities and societies. They are the touchstones we should all reach for at a time of crisis, like we find ourselves today. -The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission, to whom I am very grateful for the kind invitation to speak today, has an enormously important role to play in giving life to the Declaration in Myanmar. As its founding law set out, the MNHRC’s aim is to create a society where human rights are respected and protected, in recognition of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[1]-UNDP is very proud to support the Commission and its leadership and staff in this mission. In recent years, we have worked in close partnership with the Commission to assess and strengthen its capacity, to help develop its Strategic Plan, and to support its continuity of work and its accessibility during the COVID crisis. These achievements would not have been possible without support from many partners, including the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, the UN’s human rights organizations, and the Government of Norway for its great support.-The theme of this year’s International Human Rights Day is “Recover Better - Stand Up for Human Rights”. It’s an important theme, moreso now than ever before as we find ourselves in the middle of a crisis. So I would like to recognise the human rights defenders, the activists, the journalists, and the community and civil society representatives who stand up for human rights across the country every single day.-In the words of the United Nations Secretary-General, civil society groups are our allies in upholding human rights, and our indispensable partners in forging peace.[2] They are also our critical partners here at UNDP in Myanmar, and I would like to welcome today the opportunity to recognise and celebrate civil society’s very real contributions to the realisation of human rights every day in Myanmar.-In closing, I wish you and your families a safe and peaceful close to 2020. And I wish us all a much brighter, more secure 2021, in which we can continue our shared efforts to leave no one behind, and the promise of the 2030 Agenda, and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.-Thank you all very much for this opportunity.--[1] Section 3(b), MNHRC Law, 2014.-[2] ‘United Nations Chief Antonio Guterres on the crucial voice of Civil Society in #ShapingOurFuture!’, 26 June 2020, https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=265733694877374.- ",[],"Health,In the news,Speeches,Myanmar,Development Effectiveness,Governance and peacebuilding,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,News,Sustainable development,Gender equality"

Whereas the on-going pandemic threatens the mere existence of scores of “offline” businesses, with a view to accelerate our digital transformation, the Ministry of Commerce has collaborated with development partners, such as UNDP Myanmar, to accelerate digital innovation and ensuring the innovation nurtures, boosts digitalisation and ultimately increases economic diversification for both domestically and cross-border. We hope to see more businesses adopting online tools as the key strategy towards building resilience to the COVID-19.-Quote from the UNDP Myanmar, Mr. Titon Mitra, Resident Representative of UNDP Myanmar-UNDP Myanmar is honored to partner with the Ministry of Commerce, Myanmar to organise the “MoCOM E-Commerce Innovation Challenge.’ The Challenge is an important initiative leveraging digital and technological innovations to support in building resilience to the COVID-19 in Myanmar, said UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Titon Mitra. UNDP, as part of the wider United Nations’ Socio-Economic Recovery Framework, is committed to support the Government and people of Myanmar in effectively building back better from COVID-19.-This challenge enables collaborations between organisations, corporate partners and local tech talents to collectively tackle important country development problems and leave a meaningful impact through innovative tech solutions. The challenge owner will own the IP and the project, which will be implemented afterwards through the support of the stakeholders.

1 October 2020, Bangkok/Naypyidaw – The UN-REDD Programme has announced a USD 2 million project supported by the Government of Norway that will help make mangrove sustainable management, restoration and protection an integral part of Myanmar’s efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 

 The “Integrating mangroves into REDD+ Implementation in Myanmar” initiative, announced today at the 3rd Mekong Mangrove Forum, focuses on tackling Myanmar’s destruction and degradation of mangrove ecosystems. This will help the country reach its climate mitigation targets within its NDCs and support livelihoods of mangrove forest communities.-Myanmar is home to the third most extensive area of mangrove ecosystems in Asia. Mangroves’ capacity to absorb huge amounts of GHGs from the atmosphere makes them a critical resource for climate mitigation. They also provide essential ecosystem services, such as providing a habitat to commercial fish species and coastal protection. But Myanmar has been subject to one of the world’s highest rates of mangrove clearance, with annual losses estimated at 2.2 percent of their total area between 2000-2014, as mangroves have been converted for agriculture, city expansion, and economic development.-The “Integrating mangroves into REDD+ Implementation in Myanmar” initiative aims to build on Myanmar’s recent efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on the role of mangroves in achieving the goals of the national REDD+ strategy.-”Conservation and restoration of mangroves are important elements of Myanmar’s efforts in Integrated Coastal Management and actions to reduce emissions and increase resilience to climate change impacts as part of the Myanmar Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan and the national REDD+ Strategy,” says Nyi Nyi Kyaw, Director General of Myanmar’s Forest Department. “This new UN-REDD project will assist us in ensuring that these efforts are sustainable in the long term and contribute to the fulfilment of Myanmar’s Nationally-Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement.”-The project will run in six districts that make up for more than half of the country’s mangrove area. It will support the Government of Myanmar to improve its forest governance, develop a new, reliable system to track mangroves’ carbon content for the national Greenhouse Gas Inventory, include local communities in decision-making, and tailor REDD+ interventions to local and national contexts.-The 2-year programme is implemented by the Forest Department of Myanmar and the UN-REDD Programme, a United Nations climate change partnership between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with financial support from Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI).-“The three agencies will work in close synergy, drawing on their complementary technical capacities to achieve concrete results in terms of sustainable management, restoration and conservation of mangroves in Myanmar, and thus contribute substantially to the mitigation of climate change,” says Ben Vickers, Regional Programme Officer on REDD+ for FAO.-The UN-REDD Programme was launched in 2008 and supports nationally led REDD+ processes with the aim of accessing results-based payments. It promotes the informed and meaningful involvement of all stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities, in national and international REDD+ implementation. The Programme builds on the convening role and technical expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).-Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is a mechanism developed by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It creates a financial value for the carbon stored in forests by offering incentives for developing countries to reduce emissions from forested lands and invest in low-carbon paths to sustainable development. Developing countries would receive results-based payments for results-based actions. REDD+ goes beyond simply deforestation and forest degradation and includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.-Mangroves form the foundation of a highly productive and biologically rich ecosystem which provides a home and feeding ground for a wide range of species, many of which are endangered. Although mangroves make up less than one percent of all tropical forests worldwide, they are highly valuable ecosystems, providing an array of essential goods and services which contribute significantly to the livelihoods, well-being and security of coastal communities.-For media interviews and press matters concerning the project, please contact:-UN-REDD Programme Regional Communications and Knowledge Management

The COVID-19 has impacted Myanmar businesses across broad spectrum of issues. With the almost shutting down of global commerce,  local businesses – large, medium or small -  experienced the scaling down of activities as well as sharp decline in trade. Numerous workers were laid off for indefinite period of time. With the pandemic still recurrent across the world, large and small businesses brace for more impact.-To cope with the COVID-19, businesses are adapting themselves to the “new normal” measures in operating and management issues such as contributing medical supplies, initiating worker well-being, offering support to impacted communities. More than that, it is important for businesses to demonstrate respect for human rights during the harsh economic circumstances. Mitigating impacts on human values is an important element to maintain public trust in the long term.-United Nations Development  Programme (UNDP) has designed a simple and accessible tool, Human Rights Due Diligence and COVID-19: Rapid Self-Assessment for Business, to help businesses consider and manage the human rights impacts of their operations. The self-assessment tool contains potential actions allowing for rapid but continuous reflection on the human rights risks and impacts common to many industries. It offers a partial but informative view of human rights actions in the specific context of COVID-19.-The  self-assessment is organized to present key actions or considerations along three stages of the COVID-19 crisis period - Prepare, Respond and Recover – on key aspects such as workplace hazards, labor rights, environmental and community impacts, safeguarding privacy, preventing stigma and discrimination, and corporate policy and management considerations etc.-For companies without a human rights policy, the self-assessment tool offers the opportunity to explore the feasibility of a written, public commitment to prevent, mitigate and addressing adverse human rights impacts.-The COVID-19 Rapid-Self Assessment is a joint product of the Enabling Sustainable Economic Growth through the Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework project funded by the European Union and the Promoting Responsible Business Practices through Regional Partnerships project funded by the Government of Sweden.

(Yangon, Myanmar) --- Ooredoo Myanmar and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) handed over IT equipment to the Department of Agriculture (DOA), Department of Agricultural Research (DAR) and Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) under Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation and Department of Meteorology and Hydrology under Ministry of Transport and Communications for providing ICT enabled extension services to farmers.-Around 50 different IT equipment, such as desktops, laptops, projectors, tablets, cameras, printers, recorders and mobile rechargeable speakers, were provided as a part of the Sustainable Enterprises and Agricultural Development (SEAD) Project jointly supported by Ooredoo and UNDP.-The SEAD project aims to establish an inclusive and sustainable rural development model in Myanmar’s Dry Zone region, leveraging Ooredoo’s advanced mobile technology and UNDP’s experience in promoting climate resilient farming practices in the Dry Zone region of Myanmar.-These devices will be used for creating the agriculture and livestock advisories as well as weather forecast information, disseminating to farmers and breeders in the Dry Zone region through a mobile application and digital channels.-“We partnered with UNDP for SEAD Project in line with our vision of enriching people’s digital lives. Since the launch of the project, we have been taking initial steps to shape the intended sustainable rural development model. By supporting the required IT equipment to the responsible government departments, we expect to leverage on mobile technology to provide mobile ICT enabled extension services for the farmers and scale up their knowledge and efficiency according to the future digital trend” explained U Tint Naing Htut, Head of Corporate Communications of Ooredoo Myanmar.-Farmers will have access to quality extension advisories throughout the year and will benefit from a package of virtual services comprising good agricultural practices, good livestock husbandry practices, and timely weather forecasts. Training and resource materials will also be disseminated through webinars, podcasts and short demonstration videos via YouTube and social media channels.-Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the project undertook a needs assessment to better understand the impact of the pandemic on farmers in the project locations and assess their extension support and advisory needs. The findings of the assessment have been integrated into the design and content of the virtual advisories. The project also provided COVID19 affected farmers essential agricultural inputs.-“The project provides rural farmers with access to virtual real-time, quality extension and advisory services that can be accessed on their phones. With physical distancing and stay at home requirements in place because of COVID-19, physically accessing extension services would not be possible, so the new technology is more important than ever before. However, with available online app, farmers will be able to access these services without having to leave their homes and fields,” said Mr. Biplove Choudhary, Chief of the Sustainable and Inclusive Growth Unit, UNDP.  “We remain committed to work closely with the Government, and with DoA, DAR, and LBVD in particular, in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 on rural farmers, breeders and fisherfolk across Myanmar,” he added.-As a next step, the project now intends to train key government departments’ staff in the use and management of the software including in the design and creation of advisories, production of webinars and online training programmes. They will also be trained in the maintenance of the equipment.-The project will help match supply with the demand for sustainable farming, and connect farmers to markets, and credit through the use of mobile money.-The project aims to benefit 130 villages in the Dry Zone Region of Myanmar, boosting the livelihoods of farmers.-For more information, please contact:-Ooredoo Communication Team-09973333322

The ink contains 20% Silver Nitrate – higher than the international standard of 18%.-Voter ink is a key integrity measure and is also a visible demonstration of the “one person - one vote” principle that is at the heart of elections in Myanmar. It helps to prevent electoral fraud and also provides proof of a person having performed their civic duty with a visual “I voted” signal to others. Through this, ink also enhances the transparency of an election, a key consideration for the UEC. This high-quality ink is resistant to attempts to remove it using water, soap, liquids, home-cleansing, detergents, bleaching product, alcohol, acetone or other organic solvents.-His Excellency U Hla Thein, the Chairman of the UEC, said, “We are thankful for the continued support of our international partners, including UNDP and Japan.

-The report, Temporary Basic Income: Protecting Poor and Vulnerable People in Developing Countries estimates that it would cost from $199 billion per month to provide a time-bound, guaranteed basic income to the 2.7 billion people living below or just above the poverty line in 132 developing countries.-The report concludes that the measure is feasible and urgently needed, with the pandemic now spreading at a rate of more than 1.5 million new cases per week, particularly in developing countries, where seven out of ten workers make a living through informal markets and cannot earn money if they are at home.-Many of the huge numbers of people not covered by social insurance programmes are informal workers, low-waged, women and young people, refugees and migrants, and people with disabilities – and they are the ones hardest hit by this crisis. UNDP has carried out assessments on the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 in more than 60 countries in the past few months and the evidence shows that workers who are not covered by social protection cannot stay at home without an income.-A Temporary Basic Income would give them the means to buy food and pay for health and education expenses. It is also financially within reach: a six-month Temporary Basic Income, for example, would require just 12 percent of the total financial response to COVID-19 expected in 2020, or the equivalent of one-third of what developing countries owe in external debt payments in 2020.-“Unprecedented times call for unprecedented social and economic measures. Introducing a Temporary Basic Income for the world’s poorest people has emerged as one option. This might have seemed impossible just a few months ago,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.-“Bailouts and recovery plans cannot only focus on big markets and big business. A Temporary Basic Income might enable governments to give people in lockdown a financial lifeline, inject cash back into local economies to help keep small businesses afloat, and slow the devastating spread of COVID-19,” he said.-A Temporary Basic Income is not a silver bullet solution to the economic hardship this pandemic has brought, however. Protecting jobs, expanding support to micro, small and medium enterprises, and using digital solutions to identify and access people who are excluded, are all measures that countries can take.-One way for countries to pay for a Temporary Basic Income would be to repurpose the funds they would use this year to service their debt. Developing and emerging economies will spend $3.1 trillion in debt repayment this year, according to official data. A comprehensive debt standstill for all developing countries, as called for by the UN Secretary-General, would allow countries to temporarily repurpose these funds into emergency measures to combat the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.
-Several countries have already taken steps to introduce Temporary Basic Incomes. The government of Togo has distributed over $19.5 million in monthly financial aid to over 12 percent of the population through its cash transfer programme, mostly to women who work in the informal sector. Spain recently approved a monthly budget of €250 million to top up the incomes of 850,000 vulnerable families and 2.3 million individuals up to a minimum threshold.-COVID-19 has exacerbated existing global and national inequalities and has created new disparities that are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest. With up to 100 million more people being pushed into extreme poverty in 2020, 1.4 billion children affected by school closures, and record-level unemployment and loss of livelihoods, UNDP predicts that global human development is on course to decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced.-UNDP is the socio-economic lead for the UN system on COVID-19 recovery and is implementing social and economic recovery strategies in countries across the world.-###  ###  ###-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

New York – Governments must step up to lead the fight against a growing tide of false, inflammatory and misleading information that threatens to worsen the already severe impacts of the virus, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).-By standing with their people to build a trusted relationship, national governments can mitigate the worst threats of misinformation, and in turn more loss of lives and livelihoods. UNDP is working closely with national institutions, as well as with media and civic actors, to help the fight against the spread of disinformation and misinformation, including supporting initiatives to use social media and websites to spread accurate information on COVID-19.

Advice about COVID-19 changes swiftly as medical understanding evolves, and this rapid evolution and the crippling impact on lives and livelihoods have led to a public thirst for information. Social media, informal news sources and fringe journalism have filled the void, often sowing fear, stigmatization, discrimination and confusion.-“The tsunami of fake cures, scapegoating, conspiracy theories, and false news stories that has flooded media in general and online platforms in particular has created a chaotic information environment — one that is not only undermining the effectiveness of public health measures, but also leading to real life violence and discrimination, confusion, fear and, arguably, long-term societal harm,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.-“Learning the lessons from HIV and Ebola, we must join forces to reject misinformation and stigma, anchoring our responses and advocacy in science, evidence, human rights and solidarity.  While many actors bear a responsibility to counter misinformation, real progress will not be achieved without government leadership,” Steiner added.- -The challenge today is that disinformation and misinformation tools and tactics are now literally at the fingertips of anyone who wants to co-opt COVID-19 for their own agenda, including government agencies. For example, researchers at the Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzed 112 million public social media posts related to the pandemic and found that 40 per cent came from unreliable sources, and that almost 42 per cent of over 178 million tweets related to COVID-19 were by bots. Meanwhile, Reuters Institute found that around a third of social media users have reported seeing false or misleading information about the coronavirus, while research by Pew suggests that people who receive their news primarily through social media are more likely to be exposed to false content.-In Somalia, where some of the most influential voices are sheikhs and imams (religious leaders), UNDP joined with the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs for a three-day campaign in Mogadishu, led by Sheikh Ali Dheere and other senior figures. Videos and social media graphics have reached around a million people on social media and are being used for TV and radio spots.-UNDP is also supporting Somalia’s Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs to set up a website that will provide guidelines for safe burial techniques and help mobilize the religious community to donate and deliver supplies like masks and soap and to host various information resources. UNDP set up the first Somali coronavirus website and partnered with Somalia’s biggest telecom provider, Hormuud, to deliver a recorded message on millions of phones with useful COVID-19 info and directions to the site.-In Lebanon, UNDP, in partnership with the Ministry of Information, WHO and UNICEF, launched a national campaign to counter the spread of false information, to reduce public vulnerability to information pollution and to build government capacity to counter it. A fact-checking site is being developed and an awareness campaign was launched to encourage the public to stop and think before sharing information.-In Guinea-Bissau, UNDP and the Ministry of Health supported the development of a fact-checking site (www.nobaschecker.org), which helps Lusophone citizens access trustworthy information on COVID-19. By building a wide community of fact-checking journalists, doctors, and economists from Guinea-Bissau and around the world, the site aims to fight disinformation around the pandemic by providing facts and verified news.-“The best weapons any government can deploy now are transparency, diplomacy and collaboration. Governments can lead by example, demonstrating how to use technology with integrity. They can negotiate with big tech companies, promote national digital literacy campaigns, sponsor fact-checking efforts and allow journalists to do their jobs.  This investment will pay off many times over in the form of inclusive and informed societies and engaged citizens,” said Malin Herwig, Director, ai, of UNDP’s Oslo Governance Centre.-“There is very little to gain for governments that conceal information, suppress opinion or sow divisions around COVID-19. In the immediate future, it will lead to overwhelmed health systems, angry and befuddled citizens, overstretched security forces and deepening divisions and inequalities.  In the long term, it will continue to erode democratic values and principles, human rights and social cohesion,” Herwig added.-Last month, the United Nations launched ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of COVID-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information. It will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger. In partnership with UNDP, other UN agencies, UN country teams, influencers, civil society, business and media organizations, the initiative will distribute accurate content and work with social media platforms to root out hate and harmful assertions about COVID-19.",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,In the news,News,Press release,Myanmar"

With influx of returning migrant workers, Mon State, being close to the Thai border, remains at high risk of COVID-19 infection and outbreak. While many of these returning workers are from the state, it also serves as the transit point for returning migrant workers from other states and regions. Therefore, mitigating the risk of virus infection while enforcing preventive measures among citizens has become a priority for regional authorities.--In collaboration with the Mon State Government, United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) has been implementing a five-day awareness raising campaign starting from 8th June, providing face masks and immediate hygienic supplies. In addition, information, education and communication (IEC) materials from Ministry of health and Sports are distributed in four languages – Myanmar, Mon, Kayin and Pa-O. All these materials are being distributed in 200 locations in all 10 townships across the state. These locations include crowded places such as markets, border areas, areas where large number of migrant workers live etc. --Led and coordinated by the UNDP in support of the state government’s efforts, a large number of organizations have joined hands for this the five-day campaign. These include UN agencies such as UNICEF, UN Women and UNFPA, international non-governmental organizations such as Helvetas , and also many local civil society organizations ( CSOs) . Nearly 300 local volunteers from CSOs actively involve in distributing materials and raising awareness on the importance of hand washing, social distancing , and how to wear face masks.--The UNDP-led, five-day campaign has begun on 8th June and will continue till 12th June, reaching out to more than 50,000 households in the state, with special focus on vulnerable and at-risk groups. The campaign serves as a success story, highlighting effective coordination among the state government, international development organizations, local CSOs and volunteers, as they come together to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. -",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,In the news,Health,News,Myanmar,Sustainable development"

Members of Parliament arrived back in Nay Pyi Taw, the capital city, bringing back important information of how the pandemic was affecting the lives of their constituents and how it impacted their work as MPs. COVID-19 brings forward a challenge in adapting to a new way of doing things, fulfilling their duties and responsibilities, while adhering to social distancing measures.-The government has recently launched the COVID-19 economic relief plan- an important national plan that lays out the blueprint to stabilize and help Myanmar recover from the economic shocks that all sectors are suffering from. To ensure that MPs are supported in their role conducting oversight of this national strategy, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) hosted a webinar titled How MPs can apply Myanmar’s Covid-19 Economic Relief Plan during the second week of the Hluttaw session. The webinar explored Myanmar’s Covid-19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP), and the professional toolkit that MPs can employ to apply and monitor public policy in their work. The MPs who joined the session were particularly interested to discuss how the CERP would support the most vulnerable groups and individuals in Myanmar, and how MPs can ensure help reaches those who need it most.-The webinar was led by Ms. Janelle Saffin, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (Australia).-During the webinar, MPs also discussed the need for parliamentary oversight of CERP implementation, particularly through the monitoring matrix which provides indicators for each of CERP’s action plans. Their discussion also touched upon topics such as hazards of potential outbreak in crowded urban areas, to the disruption of supply chains for basic commodities in remote areas. Daw Shwe Shwe Sein Latt, an MP from Bago Region, raised the gender impact of COVID-19 and CERP. She said that the pandemic made women’s empowerment and macro-economic development more important than ever. She was enthusiastic about the webinar: “I learnt more about how my colleagues are responding to the pandemic, which immediately informs my work in the plenary as well as committees. It’s great to also have an international perspective as part of our discussion.”-U Larma Naw Aung, an MP from Kachin State, discussed the vulnerability of internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the difficulty of responding to COVID-19 in IDP camps. The discussion considered the practical issues involved in the camps, as well as the principle to leave no one behind. For him, the webinar was very fruitful: “It’s a very helpful session. It was great to talk with colleagues, as well as with an MP from Australia who shared practical recommendations for our work as elected representatives during the pandemic.”-Ms. Saffin has reflected on the double challenge that MPs currently face: “Our communities are in great need because of the health and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. At the same time, social distancing makes it harder than ever for us to carry out our duties. We as MPs need to be creative about how we carry out our duties and responsibilities, and I am pleased to be able to support and share ideas with my parliamentary colleagues in Myanmar. The webinar was a great way for us to reflect on how we serve our constituencies, and to inspire each other to be innovative and try new things – like connecting by videoconference.”-The webinar was organized as part of the Hluttaw Learning Centre’s ongoing professional development support for all MPs. The Learning Centre operates with the support of UNDP and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), through which UNDP has also assisted in strengthening the information and communications technology infrastructure which make events like this possible. One of the key takeaways was that Webinars delivered during pandemic restrictions not only take support to the MPs online, but give them the very important and much needed opportunity to discuss their work, challenges and new approaches with their colleagues and with experienced peers from other countries at a time when national  borders are closed and travel is restricted.",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,In the news,Governance and peacebuilding,News,Myanmar"

Each has hit human development hard but, overall, development gains accrued globally year-on-year,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. “COVID-19 – with its triple hit to health, education, and income – may change this trend.”-Declines in fundamental areas of human development are being felt across most countries - rich and poor - in every region. 
-COVID-19’s global death toll has exceeded 300,000 people, while the global per capita income this year is expected to fall by four per cent.-With school closures, UNDP estimates of the “effective out-of-school rate”—the percentage of primary school-age children, adjusted to reflect those without Internet access—indicate that 60 per cent of children are not getting an education, leading to global levels not seen since the 1980s.-The combined impact of these shocks could signify the largest reversal in human development on record.-This is not counting other significant effects, for instance, in the progress towards gender equality. The negative impacts on women and girls span economic - earning and saving less and greater job insecurity -, reproductive health, unpaid care work and gender-based violence. -COVID-19: a magnifying glass for inequalities -The drop in human development is expected to be much higher in developing countries that are less able to cope with the pandemic’s social and economic fallout than richer nations. -In education, with schools closed and stark divides in access to online learning, UNDP estimates show that 86 percent of children in primary education are now effectively out-of-school in countries with low human development—compared with just 20 percent in countries with very high human development. -But with more equitable Internet access, - where countries close the gap with leaders in their development group, something feasible – the current gaps in education could close.-Determined, equity-focused interventions can help economies and societies rally, mitigating the far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.-“This crisis shows that if we fail to bring equity into the policy toolkit, many will fall further behind. This is particularly important for the ‘new necessities’ of the 21st century, such as access to the Internet, which is helping us to benefit from tele-education, tele-medicine, and to work from home,” says Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP.-Implementing equity-focused approaches would be affordable. For instance, closing the gap in access to the Internet for low- and middle-income countries is estimated to cost just one per cent of the extraordinary fiscal support packages the world has so far committed to respond to COVID-19.-The importance of equity is emphasized in the United Nations’ framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19 crisis, which sets out a green, gender-equal, good governance baseline from which to build a ‘new normal”. It recommends five priority steps to tackle the complexity of this crisis: protecting health systems and services; ramping up social protection; protecting jobs, small- and medium-sized businesses and informal sector workers; making macroeconomic policies work for everyone; and promoting peace, good governance and trust to build social cohesion. UNDP calls on the international community to rapidly invest in the ability of developing countries to follow these steps.-***-Link to “Human Development Perspectives COVID-19: Assessing the impact, envisioning the recovery”: http://hdr.undp.org/en/hdp-covid-For more information and media interviews, contact:-Adam Cathro; adam.cathro@undp.org; +1 212 906 5326-Anna Ortubia anna.ortubia@undp.org +1 646 642 4071",[],"Coronavirus COVID-19,In the news,Press release,News,Human development report"

This innovative e-voucher system is being implemented to issue grants to small scale farmers in four regions (Erongo, Kavango East, Khomas and Hardap). The focus of this digital solution is to empower the vulnerable, including the youth, women and people living with disabilities, to scale up their food and agriculture solutions.-Beneficiaries of this e-voucher granting facility will be selected through a rigorous process established by the MAWLR and the local councils of the respective regions, who are closely involved in the implementation. Each of the four regions have highlighted critical priorities for the agriculture value chain, thus ensuring that the reach of this agriculture and food grant is intensive and accurately targeted at the poor and vulnerable.-In the past, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform has distributed emergency relief subsistence grants to farmers across the country through paper-based vouchers. This system presented several challenges, including the availability of real-time data for decision making, information on beneficiaries and traceability. Implementing this e-voucher system will generate data and evidence to strengthen institutional capacities for improved accountability and increased efficiencies in grant management. Through data collected, the digital grant and subsidy issuing system would also serve as a monitoring tool to demonstrate the equitable distribution of grants to the intended beneficiaries. This will also strengthen decision making at the national level, especially on the impact of interventions.-An additional output of the BBB project is to strengthen the structures, capacity and skills of the respective municipalities to enable them become food self-sufficient to cope with the immediate impacts of COVID and to handle such shocks in the future.-To test the effectiveness and usability of the recently launched e-voucher system, a pilot execution is currently being implemented through the Build Back Better Urban Agriculture project. The BBB urban agriculture project responds to the current socio-economic impact of the pandemic in Namibia by focusing on enhancing food security and malnutrition in urban and peri-urban communities in Namibia. The BBB urban agriculture project is funded by the Government of Japan and jointly implemented by MAWLR and UNDP Namibia with close collaboration with the respective regional councils in Erongo, Hardap, Kavango East and Khomas).-Beneficiaries will be carefully selected to ensure that the intended target of women and youth aged between (19 and 59 years) and persons living with disabilities have been included. A call for proposal submission for the grant has already commenced, which details eligibility, criteria and conditions for application. Eligibility conditions include the fact that applicants should be Namibian citizens residing within the boundaries of one of the participating municipalities & town councils (Windhoek, Swakopmund, Maltahöhe and Rundu).-The e-voucher granting system and the process flow for disbursement has been agreed upon by the project steering committee, which is an inclusive body of all project stakeholders and partners. As implementing partner, UNDP will issue a grant through EIF, after which EIF will disburse the grants through the e-voucher system. Cards for the e-voucher system will be issued to project beneficiaries, who can then use them to procure needed agricultural supplies at selected agri-outlets, which have been identified as execution partners within all four regions. Representatives of these outlets have also received training on administering the e-voucher system to ensure seamless process implementation.-The execution of this e-voucher grant disbursal system will expand access to informal vendors, small-scale producers, and farmers in urban and peri-urban to catalyze inclusive economic development. This innovative agriculture and food e-voucher granting solution holds the potential to unlock opportunities to enable a sustainable recovery from emergencies and disease-related shocks.",[],"Press release,FAO,Namibia"

Ladies and Gentlemen,
(All protocol observed)-Let me begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. Dr. Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila, for honouring us with her presence today and accepting our invitation as keynote speaker for the launch of the 2020 GHDR “The next frontier: Human development and the Anthropocene” and the Namibia NHDR 2019 on the theme “Addressing Inequality and Disparities: Towards a New Dignified Life for All Namibians”.-Hon Prime Minister, the UN system highly values its continued partnership and good working relationship with the Government of the Republic of Namibia through its various line ministries and agencies institutions in the areas of economic progression, social transformation, environmental sustainability, and good governance. This day marks the collaboration between the National Planning Commission (NPC) and UNDP that led to the production of the Namibia NHDR and is testimony of the great partnership and working relationship that we have built with the government that you lead. I would like to commend the NPC team that provided the leadership and oversight during the drafting and finalisation of the NHDR.-Today we come together to mark 30 years since the first publication of the human development report. In 1990 the seminal thinking and work of two renowned economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen gave birth to an authoritative construct in the form of the HDI. This approach challenged orthodox thinking that economic growth was an ideal and sufficient development indicator for measuring human well-being. Instead, it introduced a paradigm shift as an alternative way of looking at development and measuring it, by putting people, and not the economy, at the centre of development, as active agents of development, and as beneficiaries of development.-
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me to spend a moment to recount some of the far- reaching changes that this approach brought about:
✓ Evolved by changing the content and tone of development dialogue around the world.
✓ Measured development results using indices through defined indicators such as long and healthy life (life expectancy at birth), education/knowledge (means years of schooling and expected years of schooling), and decent standard of living (gross national income per capita in PPP$).
✓ Provided advocacy tools for development actors to inform and influence policy decision-making at the global, continental, regional, and national levels.
✓ To date, more than 700 NHDRs have been produced along with regional and sub-regional HDRs.-
Distinguished guests,
➢ The 2020 GHDR examines HD in a new geologic era and focuses on how HD can be expanded in balance with the planet. It brings home the stark reality of how Covid, conflict and climate are impacting poverty and exacerbating inequality.
➢ Inequality is at the very centre of the 21st century fabric. The future of development revolves around the two main constructs of inequality and sustainability and this is something we have to tackle with the utmost urgency.
➢ The 2020 report and the 2019 and the upcoming 2021 report are in a way a trilogy to explore inequality. The reports being launched today are rooted in the impact inequality has on what we are doing and equally on how we do and act that will worsen inequality including intergenerational inequality.-➢ In a relationship spanning 300,000 years, we are informed that human actions are shaping our planet instead of the planet shaping humans, thus contributing to so many changes. Some of these actions include our over dependence on fossil fuels and material consumption, which are driving climate change and biodiversity collapse, ocean acidification, air and water pollution, and land degradation.
➢ Our world has witnessed and experienced various crises in a little over a decade including the global financial crisis, the climate change crisis (enormous wildfires in Australia, the Brazilian Pantanal, eastern Siberia in Russia, and the West Coast of USA and record breaking hurricanes in the Atlantic), and now the COVID-19 crisis, which is an unexpected and unprecedented shock to human development which has further entrenched inequalities within and across all countries and also enhanced the imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of finding solutions.
➢ It is noted that global wildlife has declined by almost 70 percent since 1970. It is therefore believed that we are at the beginning of a mass extinction event, which will be the sixth in the history of the planet and the first to be caused by human actions.
➢ These human actions have made scientists consider as to whether our planet has entered an entirely new geological era, referred to as the Anthropocene, or the age of humans. This means that we are the first people to live in an age that is being highly influenced by our choices, based on which the dominant risk to our survival is ourselves.
➢ Yes, modifying our environment and planet to fit our material desires is causing severe effects, and this is becoming worse as the problem of human overpopulation, overconsumption, increasing economic activities, overexploitation, pollution, and deforestation continue.
➢ It is also true that humans have achieved many incredible things including significant improvements in health, education and living standards of billions of people around the world. However, such achievements have come at a huge cost: severe pressures on the Earth’s systems and driving our planet to the brink of collapse.
➢ In fact, it is said that no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without doing so at the expense of our planet. However, we could be the first generation to correct this wrong in the next frontier for human development.
➢ The changes taking place today on our planet are happening to biophysical environments and ecosystems and biodiversity and natural resources, which are assumed to be directly or indirectly caused by humans thus leading to global warming, environmental degradation, mass extinction and biodiversity loss, ecological crisis, and ecological collapse. Indeed, these problems are posing an existential threat to humans and our planet, hence requires us to adopt measures that will help us to navigate the next frontier, or the Anthropocene.-
➢ If we are to survive we must navigate the next frontier (The Anthropocene), by redesigning a sustainable path to progress that considers the symbiotic relationship between humans and the Earth’s systems. , There is a need to acknowledge that the carbon and material footprint of the privileged few is undermining the opportunities of the many people who have less, or nothing at all.
➢ Transformation is possible but inequalities stand in the way.
➢ Need to redesign our pathways; our choice is to rethink, restore and transform
➢ We must reorient our approach from solving discrete siloed problems to navigating multidimensional,
interconnected and increasingly universal predicaments
➢ As part of the solution, the 2020 HDR advances three principles for helping us to achieve our goal of surviving and at the same time keep healthy and easing of pressures on our planet. The principles are equity, innovation, and stewardship, which must become central to what it means to live a good life.
➢ The report also advances three building blocks that can help us to create real and lasting change for both ourselves and the planet. These are:
✓ Work with nature, and not against it. This can be achieved by regenerating forest to absorb carbon and protect wildlife, hence providing a sustainable source of food for those who live there and generate the rain that provides freshwater for those living far away).
✓ Improve incentives and change social norms. The report reveals that the world spent over $300 billion in 2019 to subsidize dependence on fossil fuels, thus making it harder for clean energy to compete. Therefore, removing these subsidies could help to reduce carbon emissions by more than a quarter.
✓ The need to change social norms. We will need to greatly transform the way we live, work, and cooperate. Such transformation can come about when social norms are changed by identifying opportunities for catalytic action to shift norms and empower people to balance their relationship with nature.
➢ Investment in new measures in this dispensation is an important requirement if we are to navigate the new frontier, or the Anthropocene. Low carbon development must be integrated in national planning. E.g. nature based accounting in Rwanda.energy, land use, transport.
➢ A focus on the human development approach-capabilities, agency and values-can support our drive to the Anthropocene, so people and planet can co-exist in a symbiotic way. Therefore, addressing inequality and empowering people can offer a pathway towards such co-existence.",['Icon of SDG 17'],"Speeches,Namibia,RCO,Human development report,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

The Environmental Commissioner, Mr. Timoteus Mufeti;
Our valued partners from;
The Ministry of Environment and Tourism,
The Ministry of Mines and Energy,
The National Planning Commission,
The Benguela Current Convention,
As well as to my fellow UNDP colleagues.-
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedules to attend this important planning meeting, especially on short notice after the initial postponement.
As is evidenced by the unfortunate postponement of this meeting, Covid-19 has emerged, and remains, a major and unpredictable risk.-
Therefore, it is very important that we “plan well” and “plan early”. A wise old woman once said “failing to plan is planning to fail”; thus, to ensure successful attainment of development impacts and project results for the ultimate beneficiaries in 2021, we must embrace the planning process in all our endeavours.-
I am hoping that by the end of June, all projects under this portfolio would have achieved 70% of their planned development results and impacting livelihoods and improved living standards of the Namibian people. To be measured (as proxy indicator) and evidenced by 70% financial delivery by end of June 2021. At the onset, I underscore that if there is no financial movements (i.e. financial delivery) then it practically means that there is no implementation of project interventions (measured in project annual outputs), which further means that there are no results being achieved. Moreover, this would mean that no desired impacts are being made on the livelihoods and lives of the people. This IS NOT a good trend, status nor achievement that UNDP (and I am sure the Ministry, i.e. MEFT) would be happy with.-
We are hoping that this SEMER portfolio planning meeting will pioneer a new approach to planning which will help us “plan together and break down silos”. Horizontally and vertically. To solve the development challenges and twin problems (poverty and environmental degradation) that Namibia is facing; we must pool our collective intelligence, experience, knowledge, and learn from each other. The projects that are structured under the SEMER portfolio serve as entry points to solve some of the Namibia's environmental challenges, with the end goal of reducing poverty, addressing inequality, and building resilience.

As we move forward with our planning and monitoring for the year 2021, it is very important that we focus on the impacts and results for our beneficiaries on the ground, and not simply focus on activities and financial delivery. We must keep Meme Frieda in mind.-
Meme Frieda lives in an informal settlement in Katutura with her five children. One of her children is a person with a disability. What matters to Meme Frieda is that she can put food on the table, send her children to school, access, afford safe clean water, has power/energy to light, heat, and cook food, and that her home is safe from flooding, and that her children are protected from gender-based violence and safe to live a freely Namibian dream like any other “born-frees” as we call them.-
It is very important that we keep our eyes on the ball (i.e. end result) and do not forget that the aim of all our projects is to build resilience and eradicate poverty. The SEMER portfolio is the largest portfolio in the UNDP CO, and it is central that we implement it well. We are hoping to be able to adopt this approach to planning with our other 2 portfolios as well. And we hope that through these portfolios, as we adjust and adapt, we can integrate all our efforts so that SEMER contributes to Governance, Responsive Institutions and Civic Engagement (GRICE) and similarly to Sustainable Inclusive Green Growth (SIGG), and vice-versa.-
Lastly, at the portfolio-level, there should be clear arrangements of risk management strategies which will enable us to come up with mitigating measures and actions to address the collective challenges we are facing, including risks posed by the coronavirus.-
Therefore, we are all gathered here this week, to make sure that we plan early, we plan well, and we remind ourselves of the bigger picture. And finally, that we learn and lean on each other’s as we navigate these challenges. UNDP is with you and will be with you as a partner of choice. A good plan is an entry point for any successful project. However, individual, and institutional commitments and personal desires to make a difference in the lives of those whom we serve are main ingredients of success.-
On behalf of our Resident Representative Ms. Alka Bhatia, I would like to thank GEF as our co-financed partner of the majority of the interventions under this portfolio and thank the government of Namibia for entrusting UNDP to serve as the implementing agency of the GEF.-
With this, I would like to warmly welcome you all and wish all of us good deliberations and a very fruitful planning week.-I Thank you.

Fellow UNDP colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen;-Good Afternoon!
• It is my distinguished honour to deliver these remarks on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia, at this very important event, the training of small-scale miners on environmental, health and safety, which has coincided with the handover of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).-• First of all, I would like to give you a brief introduction on UNDP, as to what it is all about. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a global programme that is supporting countries around the world to achieve their development goals, in the following areas: 1) poverty reduction, 2) environmental protection, and 3) social development.-• UNDP plays a big role in the national efforts to ensure sustainable development. By saying sustainable development I mean, the development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.-• In addition, UNDP is contributing to the achievement of Namibia’s Fifth National Development Plan (NDP 5). This is Namibia’s fifth plan to achieve Namibia’s long term vision for development, referred to as “Vision 2030”. I hope some of you have heard about it before.-• One of the targets under the Fifth National Development Plan is to make sure that the environment is well protected, and that fits in well with the role of UNDP.-Ladies and gentlemen,
• You may have not been aware that mining activities have potential impacts on the environment. However, this is a very important aspect that all small-scale miners should be aware of when carrying out the mining activities. The impacts of mining activities in the environment include: generation of dust (air pollution), damage to the environment (land degradation); littering (making the environment dirty), destruction of the living areas for animals (animal habitats) and destruction of plants. These are some of the things that one may not notice immediately, especially considering the fact that all what the small-scale miners have in mind is the generation of income and the reduction of poverty.-• It is therefore very important that small-scale miners become aware that: “The way to make money for the living, can also cause destruction to the environment”.-• Due to the fact that mining activities can cause damage to the environment, it has become compulsory for the small-scale miners to have Environmental Management Plans in place, to make sure that their activities can have limited or no impacts on the environment. This is a requirement of the law on the management of the environment, known as the “Environmental Management Act”, which includes a point that all the activities that have a potential to have an impact on the environment can only be carried out after Environmental Impact Assessments are conducted, after which Environmental Management Plans should be developed and be implemented. Such activities include small-scale mining.-• Sadly, many small-scale miners have been contravening the Environmental Management Act. Environmental Management Plans are important for the fact that they help small-scale miners to be aware of the potential impacts of the mining activities, and to be able to address them.-• Given the fact that conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment is expensive, it was realised that the small-scale miners need to be assisted financially to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments, and to develop their Environmental Management Plans.-• We also learned that the small-scale mining are at risk of health hazards, as they are currently operating without Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).-• In addition, the Ministry of Mines and Energy brought to our attention the need to develop Health and Safety Guidelines for small-scale miners, to make sure that they operate in safe environments. Furthermore, the Ministry of Mines and Energy pointed out to UNDP that the small-scale miners need to be trained on the environmental, health and safety issues so that they will be able to implement Environmental Management Plans, and to know how to operate in healthy and safe environments.-• After realising the challenges being faced by the small-scale miners, UNDP in joint efforts with the Ministry of Mines and Energy submitted a plan for the activities that need to be financially supported, to the Environmental Governance Programme for Improved Natural Resource Management. This is a programme that plays a role in environmental protection in the mining sector. It supports small-scale mining activities in other African countries. In May 2020, the Environmental Governance Programme made some money (funds) available to support the small-scale mining activities in Namibia. The target for the available funds are specifically for four small-scale mining hotspots, namely: Otjimbojo, Omapyu, Tubussis and Xoboxobos.-• It is therefore for this reason that Environmental Scoping Assessments for the four areas have been conducted, and that Environmental Management Plans are being developed. It is the same reason that the Ministry of Mines and Energy in partnership with UNDP were able to buy personal protective equipment for the small-scale miners, which are being officially handed over today. And it is the reason why the small-scale miners are being trained today on the environmental, health and safety issues.-• We are sincerely hoping that the small-scale miners will be able to make good use of the Personal Protective Equipment that are being handed over today, and that after this training, they will have a better understanding of the importance of the Environmental Management Plans and implement them afterwards. We are also hoping that the small-scale miners will be in the best position to implement the Health and Safety Guidelines, after which they will be operating in healthy environments.-Thank you!

I am delighted that this year the Benguela Current Convention (BCC) through the UNDP-supported Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCLME)  Project has joined us in celebrating this day under the theme:  Youth Engagement for Global Action.-· In 1999, the General Assembly of the United Nations endorsed the recommendation made by the  World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth stating that 12 August be declared International Youth Day.-· International Youth Day allows us to celebrate young peoples’ voices, actions and initiatives, and recognized their engagement and contribution on issues such as Mental Health, Civic Engagement, Peace, Eradicating Poverty and Achieving Sustainable Consumption and Production.-· The theme of the 2020 International Youth Day “Youth Engagement for Global Action” seeks to highlight how the engagement of young people at the local, national and global levels is enriching national and multilateral institutions and processes. The theme also draws lessons on how youth representation and engagement in formal institutional politics can be significantly enhanced.-· Namibia has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations in Southern Africa. 62% of the working-age population in the country are between the ages of 15 and 34, the age group broadly defined as “youth” and projections indicate that the number of 15 to 24-year-olds will have doubled by 2045.-· This youthful population is a crucial resource. However, without sufficient job prospects, it is a resource that will remain untapped. Each nation must invest in the youth to ensure balanced and equitable growth.-· As policymakers and development practitioners we need to focus on how well national plans and initiatives are achieving the goal of maximizing the youth potential and capacity. The fourth Sustainable Development Goal focusing on Quality Education calls on Governments and institutions to provide inclusive and equitable quality education to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.-· This encourages us to explore how we are shaping education to become an effective instrument for achieving sustainable growth.-· It is undeniable that the current times are unprecedented and filled with confusion and uncertainties. With the economic impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the country and world at large, now more than ever is the perfect opportunity to engage with the youth to identify innovative solutions to the intricate problems facing countries. This can only be achieved by creating safe platforms where young people’s voices can be heard to harness and nurture their talents, creativity and potential.-· In addition, challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 outbreak that the world faces now need collective global action; and youth participation and innovation must be encouraged to address these challenges.-· This year's International Youth Day aims to focus on youth engagement through three interconnected streams, as follows:-Engagement at the local and community level. For example, a recent undertaking by Namibian Youth with support from the Government and the UN to respond to Covid-19. The Namibia youth successfully implemented a 4-day door-to-door Covid-19 educational campaign that saw young people share educational information on the COVID-19 pandemic across Namibia.-Another stream of this year’s theme focuses on Engagement at the national level; such as formulation of laws, policies, and their implementation). As you may know, Namibia has a policy on Climate Change that amongst others also aims to mainstream youth, gender, child welfare and vulnerable groups into climate change responses at local, regional and national levels. As a result of this objective, the Young People of Namibia have successfully founded the Namibia Youth Coalition on Climate Change (NYCCC). The coalition is engaging many more young Namibians in taking climate change action. -The last stream focuses on Engagement at the global level. The UN has set up a global online campaign running today. Use the Hashtags #YouthDay, #Youth4GlobalAction, and #SDG16 on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms to help spread the word and strike up a conversation surrounding youth engagement for global action.-It is fundamentally important to have youth engagement and participation in various developmental issues. The UN has long recognized that young people are a major human resource for development and key agents for social change, economic growth and technological innovation. Participation in decision-making is, therefore, a key priority area of the UN agenda on youth.-· Tangible actions have been undertaken by the UNDP in this regard through the launch of the Accelerator labs. These labs are a new service offering from UNDP that works with people, governments, and the private sector to re-imagine development for the 21st century. Only sixty countries globally are piloting this new programme and Namibia is one of them, having launched the Namibia Accelerator Lab on the fifth of July 2019.-· A recent undertaking by the UNDP Namibia Accelerator Lab is a Service Innovation Hackathon, that was completed just two weeks ago. This initiative called on young people amongst others to come up with an innovative prototype idea that will help solve government service delivery challenges.-· A first of its kind, this hackathon proved to be a success with 68 entries submitted by young Namibians around the country.  38 entries were shortlisted and 16 were chosen to present their proposals.  Five proposals made it to the final judging phase and of which three were picked as the overall winners, with prizes handed over to them on 31 July 2020.-· The winning Application by young people is the Pro-Food App. The app digitizes Namibia’s local and traditional food system flows thereby providing mapping, visualizing and monitoring capacity to allow food to be located, procured and distributed to the end beneficiary more transparently.  The App allows broader participation in the local and traditional food value chain through a “one-stop-shop approach” for local small-scale producers (e.g. women cooperatives & single producers) to procurement hubs and partners (e.g. Government, Semi-Government, Food aid programmes; Private sector) to end users (e.g. consumers and distributors of food parcels) and to end clients (e.g. beneficiaries).-· Another endeavour by UNDP is the launch of the new ocean innovation challenge on 8 January 2020.  This unique new support has been designed to accelerate the progress of the fourteenth Sustainable Development goal, Life Underwater by the identifying, financing, advising and mentoring of genuinely innovative, entrepreneurial and creative approaches to the ocean and coastal restoration and protection that sustains livelihoods and advances the ’blue economy’-· This year’s celebrations are timely for us because the Government of Namibia just launched a new Public Sector Innovation Policy. This policy provides a framework on how to comprehensively manage and speed up the public sector through good governance, accountability, transparency and improved performance service delivery as part of the Harambee Prosperity Plan.-· I am particularly delighted to note the support offered by the BCC to youth initiatives over the years. One being the support for the first youth summit hosted by participants from Angola, Namibia and South Africa, to express their ideas, concerns and recommendations for the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem region.-· I am happy to note that the youth are committed to meaningful participation around the work of the BCC. One of the commitments from the summit was that the youth will strive to increase awareness of all citizens on the ocean and coastal issues through innovative means such as technology, the cybersphere, media platforms and social networking mechanisms such as  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and so forth. I am looking forward to seeing the results of these and other commitments.-· As I conclude my remarks, I wish to recognize partners who have actively stood with the Government in mitigating the challenge of youth empowerment. Your contribution to the empowerment of young people is commendable and I look forward to our continued fruitful support.-· I would also like to assure you that the United Nations System in Namibia is committed to Youth engagement and participation. As such, I would like to announce that the UN in Namibia in partnership with the Ministry of  Sport, Youth and National Service is currently in the process of setting up a new programme known as UN Youth Namibia. I wish to encourage the youth to be on the look-out for this programme and make meaningful contributions to it.-· Finally, I would like to leave you with a quote by a young leader that I think all of us would know and that is Greta Thunberg. She says and I quote ""You must unite behind the science. You must take action. You must do the impossible. Because giving up can never ever be an option.""-·Thank you all once more for being part of these celebrations and I wish you a happy International Youth Day. I thank you.- - - ",['Icon of SDG 14'],"Africa,Goal 14  Life below water,Speeches,Namibia,English,Oceans"

The Accelerator lab has been exploring the different service delivery challenges that have been identified.-Many of the current challenges that governments have been facing are issues which either have to do with cumbersome and manual processes that are tedious and require “out of the box thinking”. There are a total of 9 challenges all related to service delivery which are highlighted as current challenges which government is currently facing as follows: Digitization of Services; Economic Transformation; Ease of Doing Business; Tourism of Tomorrow; Access to Essential Services; Virtual Healthcare; Protecting the Vulnerable; Building strong institutions and Accountability.-The Service Innovation hackathon challenged participants to develop digital and innovative solutions to address the pain points and challenges government has been experiencing on service delivery. First of its kind, this project proved to be a success with 68 entries submitted by young Namibians around the country.  Over half of the entries were shortlisted and 16 were chosen to present their proposals.  Five proposals made it to the final judging phase of which three were picked as the overall winners.- - -UNDP Namibia Resident Representative, Ms Alka Bhatia, and the Permanent Secretary at Office of the Prime Minister, Ms Nangula Mbako, handed over the prizes to the lucky winners.  “If and when these solutions work, they will need to be scaled up for policymakers who are interested in introducing innovation for a particular sector”, Ms Bhatia stated at the award ceremony. This model is one in which the Accelerator Lab follows as a means of addressing societal challenges and fostering a more collaborative and inclusive approach.-The winning apps-1st Prize – Pro-food Application. The ProFoodApp digitizes Namibia’s local and traditional food system flows thereby providing mapping, visualizing and monitoring capacity to allow food to be located, procured and distributed to the end beneficiary in a more transparent manner. - -2nd Prize – Kwafa  E-Home Affairs.  Kwafa is a platform where you can apply or renew your passport in the comfort of your own home.- -3rd Prize - Traffic Ticket Management. Traffic ticket management is a centralized online portal that allows citizens to view outstanding fines and pay their outstanding traffic fines.- -The Service Innovation hackathon was a joint initiative between the Office of the Prime Minister, Green Enterprises, Namibia University of Science and technology, the Anti-corruption Commission and the UNDP. The winning Apps will be refined through prototype testing and further refined and developed. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will then be ‘handed over’ to the custodian government Office/ Ministry / Agency for further piloting given scaling it up and improved in subsequent iterations.- ","['Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Africa,Public service delivery,Namibia,News,Accelerator Labs,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

This increase in the level of first-time voters provides an opportunity for young people to determine the next set of leaders for the country through their participation in active citizenship.-“Young Nigerians and women play a critical role in democracy as they can act as catalysts for social change and good governance simply by participating in the election process” said Mohamed Yahya, UNDP Nigeria Resident Representative. “Their enthusiasm, resilience, and creativity needs to be harnessed, paired with the right platforms and opportunities for engagement, to help catalyze important changes in Nigeria’s political system ”.-Although young people between the ages of 18-35 make up 51.1% of registered voters, only 46% of these voters turned out to vote in the 2019 elections. This missed opportunity for young people to shape governance in Nigeria can be reversed with a political mobilization strategy premised on innovation, inclusion, collaboration, consistency, and context-specific interventions.-The #SixtyPercentofUs Project aims to leverage this opportunity ahead of the 2023 elections and will host a number of activities that will create platforms for civic engagement and access to information, including the recently launched Power of 18 Challenge.-“Nigerian youths have the numbers to determine elections, and more importantly, they can vote for good governance.

She was forced to flee her community Kirikasamma because of the over decade long conflict that resulted in frequent insecurity and destruction across the region. -Hauwa reflects on her experience: -“We left Kirikasamma because our house was burnt to the ground during one of the attacks” she recalled. “As we were trying to leave to Damboa town, we were ambushed again, and my husband suffered a heart attack and regrettably passed away”.-After experiencing the devastating loss of her husband while navigating a challenging journey to seek refuge, Hauwa and her children finally arrived to Damboa town and were allocated a space in the camp. - -Hauwa and her children lived in a small space made with raffia and tampoline, relying mostly on humanitarian aid and support from the local community for food and other day to day needs. The living conditions in the camp have been extremely challenging, with little access to basic amenities as well as frequent flooding and congestion that often cause outbreaks of malaria and cholera. The wellbeing of Hauwa and her children is also limited, with little privacy from others and protection from harsh weather conditions and security threats.-Hauwa explained the conditions of life in camp:-“Life is hard here. We don’t have water or electricity; my children suffer continuously from serious illnesses” she explained. “During the rainy season, the camp becomes flooded, and we live in difficult conditions because the roof of our shelter leaks and our belongings are constantly wet and damp”-Hauwa’s teenage daughter Amina, shares her own experience living in the camp: -“We are grateful to have a place to lay our heads after our house was destroyed, but at the same time, it is not comfortable” Amina shared.  “For example, myself and other young girls normally shower in a remote corner of the camp we created for ourselves just so we can get some privacy but we are often scared for our safety when we do.”-Although going back home to Kirikasamma is not an option just yet for Hauwa and her family, having a decent living space to call home would help ignite a sense of hope that things will return to normal soon.-
- -To respond to these immediate needs of the community, the Nigerian Government, with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and generous contributions from the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, launched stabilization activities aimed to help communities across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States build back better. -Stabilization activities aim to help restore access to basic services, increase security and enable livelihood opportunities for communities that have been impacted and displaced by conflict.-In 2019, Damboa town was selected as one of the communities to receive stabilization support. Included in one of the interventions is the construction of 500 two-bedroom housing units. This is a critical need for both former residents, as well as displaced people who cannot yet return home. It will enable impacted people, like Hauwa, to have a place to live in dignity and begin a new journey towards recovery. -Hauwa and her family were selected as one of the recipients of the new housing units in Damboa. Walking around and admiring her new home, Amina her daughter, was happy to have a functioning and safe space that her family could call their own. As she unpacked her books, she shared:-“I am so happy about our new home. It is very close to my school, and now I no longer have to walk long distances to get to school, which makes me feel safer” she said.” -For Hauwa, this is the first step in being able to restart her life again. As there is still much to be done in the region, stabilization efforts act as a starting point in achieving stability and recovery in the years to come.-As Hauwa proudly stood in her new home, she smiled, “Having a place to call home brings peace and stability, it’s the first step to my family’s recovery”.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 03']","Nigeria,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Featured,Crisis response,News,Success Stories"

The contribution will be used to provide support to conflict-affected communities through the provisioning of livelihood and economic opportunities, restoration of basic services, the establishment of effective and accountable local governance and the revitalization of social cohesion and community security in the region.-The prolonged conflict in the north-east continues to cause human critical incidents, the displacement of communities and increased dependency on humanitarian aid. In addition to the long-standing difficulties, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has increasingly caused deterioration of the security situation and the standard of living in communities across the region. -Through support from the Government of Japan, these stabilization and early recovery efforts will adopt an integrated resilience-based strategy that aims to enable community recovery and peace building. His Excellency MATSUNAGA Kazuyoshi, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Federal Republic of Nigeria said “The Government of Japan recognizes the importance of stabilization and recovery in the conflict-affected communities in the north-east of Nigeria and is committed to promoting peace and stability in the region by working in collaboration with UNDP and other relevant stakeholders with the aim of fostering prosperity in Nigeria in particular and Africa in general” he said. “The Government of Japan will continue to work with our longtime partner, UNDP, to implement and sustain comprehensive humanitarian assistance for the stability and recovery of communities in north-eastern Nigeria.”- -Specifically, the contribution will be used to fund agricultural skill improvement programmes for 2,000 farming households, vocational skills training for 1,000 youth, enhanced access to basic services for 5,200 community members, emergency employment opportunities for 1,050 workers, governance training for 40 state and local government officials and Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) training for 1,800 community members. Furthermore, state and local government officials will be provided opportunities to learn from the Japanese experience on conflict recovery throughout this initiative.-“Nigeria is facing a protracted conflict in its North East region, all while the health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are retracting development gains across its communities” said UNDP Resident Representative Mohamed Yahya. “We are grateful for the strategic partnership between the UNDP and the Government of Japan which will assist in Nigeria’s recovery through the provisioning of livelihood opportunities, training and strengthening of capacities and basic services to boost peace building and recovery efforts.”-The Government of Japan is a longstanding partner of the UNDP both globally and in Nigeria, with strong support towards the realization of human security. To date, the Government of Japan has allocated over 25 million dollars, for the recovery and peacebuilding of conflict-affected regions in Nigeria.- -About the Support for stabilization and early recovery of the conflict-affected communities in North-East Nigeria Project-The project aims to support stabilization and early recovery in the conflict-affected communities in the north-east Nigeria. Building on the lessons and successful results of the former UNDP projects in the region, the supports to the communities will be provided using UNDP integrated community stabilization and resilience building approach for the proposed three outputs: livelihood and economic opportunities of the target communities are improved, basic services are restored with local governance strengthened in target states, mechanisms for enhancing social cohesion and community security is strengthened. -Under the project, 2,000 crop farmers households will improve their agricultural skill, 1,000 youth have opportunities of 2-month vocational training and business start-up cash grant, Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLAs) in the communities will be strengthened for access to finance of the over 1,500 members, 5,200 will benefit from improved access to basic services, with 1,050 workers employed. Three state government high officials will have learning experience on recovery of Japan, 1,800 community members (inc. no less than 720 women) will be trained to prevent Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBVs), and 12 local platform will be set up to continuous prevention.- -For more information and media enquiries contact:-At the UNDP:-Alison Clement – Communications Specialist, UNDP Nigeria | +234 701 590 6558| alison.clement@undp.org -At the Government of Japan:-Ose Tae – Focal person, Japan Embassy in Nigeria |tae.ose@mofa.go.jp","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 03']","Nigeria,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Crisis response,Featured,UNDP Donor Partners,News,Press release"

She joined the school in 2019 in hopes of earning an education so that one day she can achieve her lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.-Established in 1991, GSSS Uba has been providing quality education to students within Adamawa State, but like most schools in north-east Nigeria, it was destroyed by the decade long conflict that has impacted the region. Students have been forced out of school for months, leaving many without access to education, causing devastating impact on the Uba Hong community.-As peace has slowly started to return to the town, usual activities have begun to increase and GSSS Uba was able to open its doors to students once again. Although it was students and teachers were eager to reopen, the massive destruction from the conflict left conditions that were not conducive for a safe and supportive learning environment.-Ruth was excited to return to school to start pursuing her dream, but the conditions made it difficult for both her and GSSS Uba classmates. She reflected:-“When we returned to school, we had no choice but to continue learning under unpleasant conditions” she said. “During the rainy season we would be forced to find shelter elsewhere due to the depilated roofs, the classrooms were congested, toilets were unhealthy for use, and students fell ill all the time”.-
- -Despite these conditions, the students and teachers did not lose hope. Mr. Yusuf Sharibu, the principal of the school, shared that despite the challenges, the GSSS Uba community remained resilient:  -“The destruction of the school was a hard blow to our education system. Despite these immense challenges, we strived to continue learning and working in the destroyed infrastructure. The students and teachers were uncomfortable, but we had no choice than to continue these critical learning activities”, he said-Aligned with its goal to improve access to quality education in an environment which promotes effective learning outcomes, especially in conflict affected communities, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with support from the Government of Japan successfully completed the renovation of GSSS Uba. The renovation of GSSS Uba means more than fixing infrastructure – it means the delivery of inclusive and quality education while helping to promote sustainable learning opportunities for all.- -Included in the improvement to the school was the rehabilitation of the existing classrooms, library, dormitories, administration block buildings and the provision of a new solar powered water borehole. All renovated buildings were fully furnished and provided with solar power to further enhance the capacities of both the students and teachers. -“Everyone is happy with the renovation; the performance of both the students and teachers have improved greatly” said Mr. Sharibu. “We now have so many students enrolling - about 800 students, 30 teachers and counting!”-The rehabilitation of the school has helped to improve student’s health and safety as well as allowed them more time to focus on their studies.-“My classmates and I now feel more secure when going to school. I no longer have to miss class because of regular health issues, I have more time to spend learning because the facilities work, and my classmates and I are now able to focus on our studies more because we feel safer” Ruth shared. -
-
- -The government of Japan and UNDP have been partnering together to support the recovery of conflict affected communities in north-east Nigeria by restoring and providing access to quality public services such as education, health, water and sanitation to enable their transition to sustainable living and peace.-
- -“The path to becoming a doctor will be challenging, but it seems more realistic now,” said Ruth. “I want to be an example for other girls in my community to show them that they too can succeed at anything they want”.",['Icon of SDG 04'],"Goal 4  Quality education,Crisis response,Communities and local development,News,Sustainable development,Success Stories"

She painfully recollects when her town Potiskum in Yobe State, north-east Nigeria was attacked years ago by insurgents: -“I remember several attacks on Potiskum, from suicide bombings to targeted ambushes. It was a terrible experience for everyone, we stayed at home all day, as we had nowhere else to go” she explained. “The result was devastating to our community. My parents lost their businesses and properties, after that, they struggled to provide for the whole family”. -One of the detrimental consequences of the conflict that has struck north-east Nigeria since 2009 has been the loss of livelihood opportunities for millions of people. Individuals and families have struggled to make ends meet, which has left communities dependent on humanitarian aid for means of survival.-The challenges faced by the Potiskum community poses a vital need to support its recovery, warranting a strong focus on providing youth, like Aisha, sustainable livelihood opportunities and assistance. In response, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in collaboration with the Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (YOSEMA) and the Government of Japan, launched a programme targeting social stability and security efforts for youth inconflict-affected communities in both the north-east and Middle Belt of Nigeria.-
-
-Aisha is one of the 125 youth in Potiskum selected to participate in an eight-week training on relevant community trades such as tailoring, cosmetology, leather production, knitting and catering. Upon completion of the programme, youth then receive a cash grant to either help them setup a new business or to help support an existing venture.-Cosmetology was Aisha’s trade of choice, and now she is the proud owner of Nazeefat Product, a company that sells perfumed petroleum jelly: -“Ever since I launched my company in late 2021, I have sold over 300 perfumed petroleum jelly products” Aisha shared proudly. “With the profits made, I have been able to have enough money to attend nursing school, as well as help my parents provide for the family”.-The active engagement of youth in development efforts is central to achieving sustainable, inclusive and stable communities. This social stability and security support provided by the YOSEMA, UNDP, and the Government of Japan, aims to empower communities, especially youth, by providing them the opportunity to not only learn and grow by gaining new critical livelihood skills but also allows them to support the revival of the economic system in their communities.- - -Aisha hopes to continue to work towards expanding her shop and production house as she plans on growing her business in the future. As she begins to open her shop for the day, she shares “Opportunities like this are rare. I plan to take what I’ve learned to empower and train more young girls in my community and hope that my journey can becomes an inspiration to others too ”. - ","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 08']","Resilient recovery,Nigeria,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,News,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Jobs and livelihoods"

Although this process is helping with the return of individuals to their respective homes, the difficulty, trauma and impact of the longstanding conflict has affected many. This development has often challenged the acceptance of returnees by some community members, as some still feel uneasy with their return. -The Peace through Sports Programme is helping people rebuild intercommunal trust, heal from the effects of the conflict, and cultivate tolerance which are all critical components of achieving social cohesion.-Lawan reflected that at first, the returns caused added strife and internal crisis within the community:-“When former NSAGs started returning to Bama, I felt that they didn’t have the right to live in the same community as us and so many others felt the same way” he said. “We refused to have any contact with such individuals”.-With the introduction of football activities in Bama, the community has continued to slowly see a change in perception, helping to build unity and mutual trust among its residents. This has proved the importance of using sports as a tool to create a sense of shared identity and companionship among groups that were once inclined to treat each other with violence and hostility. -
- -Lawan shares that through the football league, his friends and others now have a reason to connect, “We have learned how to engage very well with the surrendered NSAG because we are now teammates that play football together. It has made me realize that they too aren’t so different after all”. -For Lawan, the level of trust and unity that has been formed among residents in the community since the inception of the programme is proof that sports indeed bring people together and can help to promote peace and communal living. -To date, over 15 football teams have been formed across three locations in Borno State, providing a community platform for peace and stability, as well as acting as an important tool to prevent other community members from joining in violent extremist activities in the region. -As he put on his football jersey and prepared for the next game, Yara smiled and shared, “We never thought we could relate so well, but it is happening, and we are happy. It is my hope that this will also encourage others in our State to surrender and embrace peace too.”",['Icon of SDG 16'],"Nigeria,In the news,Featured,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Sustainable development,News,Success Stories,Newsletter"

The process included rigorous research and public and private sector validation to arrive at specific SDG-aligned business models, where private investments may be channelled to create social, environmental, and financial returns. It identified opportunities where development needs and policy priorities align to create impact.-The investment map identified 17 Investment Opportunity Areas (IOA) across 7 sectors and is available on a public digital platform here. The platform provides an opportunity to access market information across several data points and connect with relevant organizations. -

The documentaries were showcased to a global audience of impact ecosystem players at the Annual Impact Investor Convening conducted in Lagos, Nigeria in November 2021 and organized by the Impact Investors Foundation.-

Majority of the water supply in Tofa and Doka came from nearby communities and water vendors, and occasionally from the community leaders when available. This often resulted in conflict between communities who also depend heavily on water for their livelihoods. To address this growing challenge, the Women Farmers Advancement Network (WOFAN), with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), assisted by drilling 2 water solar boreholes with 500,000 litres capacity for both communities. -
-
- -UNDP is working with WOFAN through the Small Grants Project (SGP) to help both communities adapt to climate change, improve their water management and promote sustainable livelihoods. The two communities are the biggest towns in Tofa Local Government Area in Kano State, contributing about 70% of the estimated population of 116,292 in that local government (NBS, 2021).-Boreholes are used to provide safe and clean water from underground and has provided long-term access to hundreds of households within these two communities. The boreholes are solar powered and have a total of 20 outlets each, with 10 outlets for domestic water collection, and another 10 for a mosque to carry out religious obligations. They also assist with irrigation purposes for nearby farms and vegetable gardens, which has also led to reduced dependence on streams and stagnant waters.-These communities have already seen major benefits. For example, with a much shorter walk for water, community members have more time for school, work, and other activities:-
- -“The construction of these boreholes will positively impact years of education by freeing up time that children spend collecting water instead of going to school. It will also reduce the prevalence of disease that can keep them out of school and will contribute to a safe and healthy learning environment”, community leader Garba Wakili said. He also added that it has also reduced the burden of water collection by women and girls over long distances, which has been associated with negative effects on well-being, and a higher risk of gender-based violence. -
- -Through this programme, farmers have also been trained on how to improve rice and groundnut farming, plastic recycling, farm residue briquetting, neem seed production and product commercialization. Two acres of land were provided for cultivating varieties of crops, including vegetable seedlings, tubers, and fruits, using various recyclable materials like tyre, old jute sacs, plastic buckets and calabashes to produce crops that meets family nutritional and medicinal needs of the community. - -
-In addition, youth were also trained at the conservation center in Tofa community on the usage of plastic materials to make drip irrigation which was initially regarded as waste by many in both communities. The training has paved the way for efficient water management and energy conservation, ‘‘We’ve been made to understand that plastics play a major part in our daily lives and the practice of disposing plastics after each use poses a threat to the sustainability our community and environment. Now, we can reuse and recycle these plastics which in turn enables us to generate income that we use to care for ourselves and family” explained Yahaya Mukhtar, a member of the community.-
- -24 groups were supported on savings and thrift schemes. These groups are now saving and providing loans to members to grow their agro-businesses. More market opportunities have also been created through creation of linkages between the groups off-takers and aggregators.-
- -“A lot of positive changes have happened since our community received this borehole, especially for women” shared Umma Ado, women head in Tofa community. “The waterborne and water-related diseases we experienced before have reduced and the trainings held here has helped our community embrace sanitation and hygiene”. -According to Umma, benefits of the project will include improvements in living conditions and public health and will empower girls education and women’s economic activity. “It is my hope that the project will continue to promote community involvement in the management of water and sanitation and include specific measures to enhance women’s participation and voice.”","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 06']","Nigeria,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,In the news,Featured,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Sustainable development,News,Success Stories"

Launched in August 2021, the NJFP is a government led youth employment initiative that will place 20,000 young Nigerians graduates annually with one-year paid work placements in private and public sector companies across the country.-There is critical need for diverse support and resource mobilization, beyond traditional public finance and international aid, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and address some of the country’s biggest challenges, like youth unemployment. The Jubilee Fellows Fund provides an opportunity for a wide range of stakeholders, including private sector, start-ups, foundations, international financial institutions, philanthropists and multilateral and bilateral donors to contribute funding towards the implementation of the NJFP, helping to provide a solution to the high rate of unemployment of young people across the country. -“Youth unemployment continues to be one of the most ardent challenges facing Nigeria today. The Federal Government is working tirelessly to reduce unemployment through various policies that support existing businesses, encourage start-ups and build an efficient workforce.”, His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Vice President of Nigeria declared in his written remarks. “It is my firm belief that the Jubilee Fellows Programme will provide a template for empowerment across the continent. It is a true testament to how collaboration between government, development partners and the private sector should work.”-
- -In attendance at the high-level launch event in Abuja today was Mrs. Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice President, European Commission; the Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Mr. Otunba R. Adenyi Adebayo who represented His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, the Vice President of Nigeria; the Honourable Minister of State, Budget and Planning, Mr. Prince Clem Ikanade Agba; Her Excellency Samuela Isopi, Ambassador at the Delegation of the European Union to the Federal Republic of Nigeria & ECOWAS; Mr. Matthias Schmale, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (a.i), United Nations in Nigeria and Mr. Mohamed Yahya, Resident Representative, UNDP Nigeria.-Ambassadors and high-level representatives from the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Norway as well as EuroCham Nigeria and private sector leaders, were also present at the launch event.-
- -During the launch of the Fund, the EU signed a development cooperation agreement of €55million with the Federal Government of Nigeria out of which €44million is earmarked for the NJFP.  The Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs. Margrethe Vestager declared “Our objective in this programme is to support the creation of new green and smart jobs for young graduates, including women and groups living in vulnerable situations. These are exactly the type of jobs we wish to promote under the new EU Multiannual Indicative Programme for Nigeria and under the Global Gateway initiative”.-
- -The Fund will be managed by the UNDP on behalf of the Government and partners, and a Steering Committee comprised of contributing partners will provide strategic guidance and oversight on the direction and execution of the Fund. The Steering Committee will be supported by a high-level Advisory Group of private sector leaders which was also inaugurated at the event.- “I want to call on everyone – from private sector leaders to the international community and the Nigerian diaspora – to accompany the development journey of young Nigerians and lend their support to the Fund as the success of the Jubilee Fellows Programme is our collective gain.”, Mr. Mohamed Yahya, Resident Representative at UNDP Nigeria said. “The homegrown talent we have here in Nigeria is immense and it is critical that stakeholders from all backgrounds collectively work together to provide the foundation for young people to flourish and thrive.”-
- -Contributions will be received and administered by the UNDP in accordance with UNDP Financial Rules and Regulations and an online dashboard, tracking resource mobilization from public and private sources, is currently being established. The possibility for private individuals to contribute with donations to the Fund, via a crowd funding platform, will also be tested as part of the innovative financing model for the NJFP.- -About the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme-The NJFP is a joint youth employability initiative by the Federal Government of Nigeria and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to champion homegrown Nigerian talent by connecting young Nigerians with local job opportunities. -Through the programme, 20,000 fresh graduates annually will be equipped with on-the-job skills through a 12 month fully paid placement opportunity in private sector institutions, development agencies, NGOs and selected public sector entities. In addition, fellows will gain access to market-oriented skills through tailored mentorship and coaching programmes.-The programme will bridge the gap between graduates and the labour market, building a pipeline of young talent that is ‘future- ready’ and understands the needs, challenges and realities that companies face in a changing post-COVID job landscape.

The courthouse, funded by the Government of Canada for CAD $32 million, will enhance access to justice for approximately 359,000 people from Hebron and surrounding areas.-In his opening remarks, His Excellency Chief Justice Issa Abu Sharar thanked the Government of Canada and UNDP for making this project possible. “For many years the Hebron judiciary was facing a challenge of providing an appropriate environment for litigation until the construction of the Hebron courthouse was completed. The space now takes into consideration judicial and gender requirements and respects the provision of the law image,” he added.-The new courthouse, built to be a model for future court designs in the West Bank, houses the First Instance, Magistrate and Appeal courts, Public Prosecution Service, and the Judicial Police Services over a gross floor area of approximately 16,050 square meters. Its construction has generated approximately 66,339 workdays (530,718 working hours) for people in the Hebron and southern area of the West Bank.-Lynn Hastings, United Nations Resident Coordinator, underlined that ""Justice is a prerequisite for people’s trust in institutions – not only from within societies but from the view of partners around the world. Without that trust, peace and security and even economic development will not flourish.""-The Hebron courthouse is considered the second largest court in terms of caseloads, after Ramallah’s main courthouse. The project will allow the Hebron courts to handle more cases, hence increasing the efficiency of the justice system, and reducing the existing backlog. The courthouse has dealt with approximately 51,705 cases during 2021.-In her remarks, the Representative of Canada in Ramallah, Ms Robin Wettlaufer, noted that this flagship initiative will increase access to justice services for Palestinians. “Inclusive and safe access to justice services for all citizens is a building block for a just society. Therefore, considerations for vulnerable groups, including women, girls and juveniles, were taken into account. This includes privacy and protection features to ensure that sensitive cases, including those related to gender-based violence, are managed appropriately.”-Equipped to meet international architectural standards, the courthouse utilizes photovoltaic solar panels on the roof and rainwater harvesting, as well as building automation and digitalization to minimize energy consumption and maximize the efficiency and quality of services provided.-The court floor plans were organised around the central courtrooms, allowing the public, judges, jury, and persons in custody to enter from separate areas, ensuring safety and security for all court users. Gender was also a fundamental consideration during the design and construction phases of the project. The new Hebron Courthouse ensures that the privacy needs of women and girls, as well as men and boys, have been appropriately taken into consideration. This has put the needs of the courthouse users at the heart of project.-UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, Yvonne Helle, thanked the Government of Canada for their partnership and highlighted that the building has an assertive civic quality and an important location. “The courthouse is a place where life changing decisions are handed down. So to have a place that is accessible, modern and user-friendly is really important,” she added.  -The ceremony, which took place at the new premises of the Hebron Courthouse on 25 March 2022, was attended by H.E. Chief Justice Issa Abu Sharar; Attorney General Akram Al Khatib, H.E. Minister of Justice Dr Mohammed al-Shalaldeh, Deputy Special Coordinator, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Ms Lynn Hastings, the Representative of Canada in Ramallah, Ms Robin Wettlaufer, UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator Ms Yvonne Helle, as well as members of the bar association, the judiciary, Palestinian police, and local and international community.","['Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Access to justice,In the news,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Governance and peacebuilding,Canada,News,Press release,Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People,English"

The INSPIRE2022 conference is the third of the annual series that aims to empower youth towards positive change and play an active role in their communities.-Under the theme: “Confusion to Clarity: Preparing for Uncertain Futures”, the third annual conference was held on 22 March 2022 as a hybrid event in light of the circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. The theme this year was a result of several meetings with the leading youth team of INSPIRE. Fostering a “giving back” approach, approximately 600 youth, as well as community leaders and representatives of local and international organizations attended the conference in person along with over 350 people virtually.-Mr Talal Al-Hothal, Director of Al Fakhoora Programme in Education Above All Foundation highlighted that INSPIRE was always a unique event. “The Youth has exceeded our expectations. INSPIRE is among the distinguished initiatives that were designed not only to serve Al Fakhoora programme but extended to serve the whole community”. Mr Al-Hothal continued by addressing the youth; “for three years, you continued to design an inspirational conference that reflects the level of inspiration in your hearts and minds. It is because of this success, Al Fakhoora programme exceeded the borders of Gaza to include other youth from the MENA region. We will continue to support the marginalized youth that live in conflict areas”.-The Al Fakhoora scholars led the conference along with their peers in Gaza. These young people played a key role in shaping the conference agenda and the leadership development of an inspirational road that engaged artists, intellectuals, young learners, and writers. Three small business ideas led by young entrepreneurs were also selected to showcase their work at the conference.-In her opening remarks, UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, Ms Yvonne Helle, highlighted that Gaza has a fast-growing population, 22% of it is youth. However, without sufficient job prospects and a 71% unemployment rate among young graduates, it is a resource that will remain untapped. “INSPIRE is a safe platform created to harness and nurture young people’s creativity and potential and have their voices heard on issues related to social change, economic growth, employability, technological advancements, and mental health,” she added.-Prior to the conference, the young men and women from Gaza participated in the design of the discussion panels during a six-day boot camp. Five roundtable discussions were also organized engaging 200 academics, professionals, private sector, and NGO representatives, in addition to four virtual webinars that were attended live by over 250 people, along with 6,500 people offline via the webinar.-The young organizers were also heavily engaged in the development of policy papers focusing on the five focus areas presented at the panel sessions and moderated by Al Fakhoora alumni. The sessions addressed higher education as an engine of development or being a decorative action; skills as a drive for employability; entrepreneurship horizons and missing links; cryptocurrency being an opportunity or a challenge; and mental health for productivity. The panels engaged both prominent experts as well as Al Fakhoora scholars.-Engineer Aref Al Husseini, Founder, and Chairman of Al Nayzak Organization affirmed in his welcoming speech that the conference is the result of a long process of learning and reflection. “We have to believe in the capabilities of our youth and provide them with sources of knowledge and leave them to go through the experience alone. What young people can do and achieve, especially in this digital era, is much greater than what we can imagine. Perhaps we also, as digital immigrants, do not understand all the details the young generation does, who is considered a native to technology. I would like to thank UNDP, Al Fakhoora Scholarship and Empowerment Programme and Education Above All Foundation for their continuous efforts and cooperation in implementing this programme and supporting Palestinian youth,” Mr Al Husseini added.-The conference took place at Al Mashtal Hotel in Gaza and was attended by Mr Hani Shehada, Country Manager of EAA office; Yvonne Helle, UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator; Victor Munteanu, UNDP Head of Gaza Office, with the virtual presence of Talal Al-Hothal, Al Fakhoora Director of EAA and Mr Aref Al Husseini, Founder and Chairman of Al Nayzak Organization for Supportive Education and Scientific Innovation.- -Notes to Editors:-Education Above All (EAA) Foundation-The Education Above All (EAA) Foundation is a global education foundation established in 2012 by Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser.

The new court, established under the UN Women portion of the Sawasya II Joint Programme is the first court of its kind in the State of Palestine. The event marked the national campaign to celebrate 2022 International Women's Day under the theme ""She is inspiring! It's time for change"".-The opening ceremony was attended by Governer Ibrahim Ramadan, Head of the Gender Unit Judge Imad Maswadeh, Head of Nablus Court Judge Saeda Wld Ali, as well as Ms Maryse Guimond, the Special Representative of UN Women Palestine, Ms Laura Bill, Deputy Representative of UNICEF and Mr Chris Decker, Sawasya II Joint Programme Manager and accompanying delegations, as well as several representatives of the international community.-The opening is the culmination of joint efforts made during 2020 and 2021 through interventions to renovate and ensure the Nablus Court building is able to deal with cases of violence against women and survivors. The aim is to enhance women's access to justice by ensuring a safe and responsive environment that facilitates access to justice, respects privacy, confidentiality, and dignity of women survivors of violence and strengthens the capacity and public confidence in rule of law institutions, as well as improving access to justice, security and protection services, especially for women and girls.-In this context, Head of the Gender Unit Judge Imad Maswadeh highlighted, ""We all work in partnership, and as a team. Therefore, I thank all the partners in the justice sector first, in the police, the Public Prosecution, the Bar Association, the Ministry of Justice, and all the jurists and academics who support this work. I also thank the partners in the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, and I extend my sincere thanks to the Sawasya II Joint Programme, the delegations representing donor countries, and the United Nations Entity for the Empowerment of Women and Gender Equality.”-The court’s rehabilitation process included improving its side entrance to be available only for use by women who have been subjected to violence or survivors of violence, including women with disabilities. Dividers have been placed at all entrances, reception and waiting rooms to maintain women’s privacy and ensure that they do not have to be in the same court room as other courthouse users.-The new court was implemented as part of the Sawasya II Joint Programme which is the UN’s primary vehicle for promoting rule of law, gender-based justice and human rights in the State of Palestine from the year 2018 to 2023. The Programme brings together the main United Nations bodies working in this field -- UNDP, UN Women and UNICEF -- as part of an integrated programme in which support is provided to the Palestinian Government to arrive at a system of rule of law that is progressively applied, increasingly inclusive which protects, respects and promotes human rights, gender equality, peace and security.-Mr Benjamin Anker, Deputy Head of Mission of the Netherlands Representative Office referred to this project as a textbook example of where the implementation of SDG 16 (on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and SDG 5 (on Gender Equality) meet and create synergy. He emphasized the importance of this project for improving the Access to Justice and expressed gratitude for the fruitful cooperation between the court and the international community.-Space within the court has also been allocated and rehabilitated, including both the Conciliation and First Instance Courts, each providing privacy access and allowing partners, particularly the Public Prosecution Office, the Ministry of Social Development through its social worker, to be present and accompany women during the litigation process including during court hearings and appearances before a judge.-The required systems such as access control, surveillance, fire alarm and fire safety equipment, air conditioning, ventilation, public announcement, voice alarm, etc. have also been installed. In addition, the ground level (parking lot) has been rehabilitated by using about 150 m2 for use as archive rooms.-On her part, UN Women Special Representative Ms Maryse Guimond affirmed that the opening of the specialized court is considered as a critical milestone in the journey of the justice sector in the Palestinian State in promoting women’s access to justice. Ms Guimond added that the establishment of a specialized section in the court to manage and adjudicate violence against women cases is a sincere translation to the core elements of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination against women committee’s concluding recommendation on women’s access to justice.-It should be noted that future efforts will focus on the completion of the draft procedure manual on violence against women cases, which is currently being reviewed by the judges specialized in processing violence against women cases.- -About the Sawasya II UNDP, UNICEF, UNWOMEN Joint Programme:-Sawasya II is the UN’s primary vehicle for promoting rule of law, gender-based justice and human rights in the State of Palestine from the year 2018 to 2023. Sawasya II aims to work on the challenges that arise from the provision of justice and security services. Justice and security institutions are supported to enhance the quality and efficiency of the services they provide to the Palestinian people. Sawasya II supports all relevant Palestinian governmental institutions and civil society organizations in their endeavours to provide legal assistance to the Palestinian people. This support is being developed and allocated to meet the specific needs of each area of the State of Palestine (West Bank, including Area C, Hebron 2, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip).","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Governance and peacebuilding,News,Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People,Netherlands ,UNICEF,Spain,UN Women,Sweden,European Commission,Press release,Gender equality,English"

In addition, the lack of sanitary disposal sites has further deteriorated the environment, contaminating precious groundwater resources. The five-year programme will not only serve as a launchpad for introducing efficient, comprehensive, and innovative solutions to reduce environmental contamination and waste of natural resources but will also protect the health and wellbeing of Gaza residents.-Consul General of Belgium, Mr Wilfried Pfeffer, highlighted that the programme is not only in line with Belgium’s strategy towards circular economy and the transition to greener jobs particularly for youth, but it also addresses global challenges such as climate change.-Through the first phase, the focus will be given to the establishment of an environmentally and socially sound waste management system that utilized new techniques to reduce waste production. Comprehensive research, studies, and strategic plans will be developed in consultation with key stakeholders, and innovative approaches will be identified to improve natural resources management, waste reduction and green jobs creation.-Furthermore, the programme will enhance the knowledge and capacities of the Joint Services Council, municipalities, and the private sector and strengthen linkages between solid waste management and green jobs creation through piloted initiatives.-UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, Yvonne Helle, highlighted the criticality of the solid waste situation in the Gaza Strip and it being a constant source of pollution to the environment. “The only way for us to stop the waste mountains from growing and change the behaviour of dumping illegal waste is this programme as it complements other initiatives implemented by UNDP to improve waste management. Your confidence in taking the leap with us to embark on this very complex programme is greatly appreciated,”  she added.-In partnership with the private sector and local community, the programme will also support the cleaning and greening of Wadi Gaza wetland and contribute to the development of a plan and awareness campaigns to monitor and safeguard the cleanliness of the Wadi.-The signing ceremony, which took place on Thursday 09 December 2021, was attended by the Consul General of Belgium, Mr Wilfried Pfeffer; Head of Belgium Cooperation, Ms Leen Verstraelen; UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, Ms Yvonne Helle, and UNDP Deputy Special Representative Chitose Noguchi.-It is worth noting that the Gaza population is expected to grow from the current 2.07 million (2020) to 4.03 million by the year 2040. The total amount of household waste generated per day will also increase to 3,383 tons / day in 2040, in comparison to the 1,726 tons/ day in 2018.

The contribution will raise the total funds from Germany to the project to Euro 29 million.-In his opening remarks, H.E. Prime Minister Shtayyeh said: “Thanks to Germany, the taxpayers, the government, the KFW, and indeed to UNDP for their spirit of cooperation on a number of projects that are vital to our people. These projects are a lever for the economy for us to strengthen our people's steadfastness and provide them with better service on the one hand, and to achieve the political goal that we aspire to, which is to end the occupation and build our independent Palestinian state on the other.”-The IPR supports Palestinian communities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigate the medium to longer-term socio-economic effects in the areas of health and employment, and enhance access to sustainable and quality services.-The additional contribution will focus on strengthening access to socio-economic services and enhancing social engagement in marginalized communities across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip. Interventions will include the rehabilitation, construction, and expansion of small-scale infrastructure, capacity development of entities to manage and operate the targeted facilities, and the organization of locally designed and implemented social cohesion activities.-“The IPR is a success story, showing quick and flexible reaction to needs. After the immediate support of urgent health requirements last year, we are now supporting communities to cope with the medium and long term implications of Corona”, Mr Michael Herold, Acting Head of the German Representative Office stated. “The IPR will also contribute to creating hundreds of short-term employment opportunities through construction works and long-term sustainable jobs for the operation and management of the new services provided, providing income and perspectives for Palestinians,” he continued.  -UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, Yvonne Helle, highlighted that UNDP’s transformative resilience approach is a key component in the sustainably of this programme and its impact on the lives of tens of thousands of people. “UNDP values its strong partnership with the Palestinian Government and Germany. This new contribution will strengthen the resilience of the Palestinian population and enable us to deliver transformative impact and build a better future together”.-In its first phase, IPR focused on addressing short-term needs brought about by COVID-19. Around 1,150 health workers (skilled and un-skilled) were deployed in 119 health facilities across the State of Palestine, generating approximately 246,261 workdays. Urgent medical equipment was also provided to some of the health facilities to enhance the health sector’s preparedness and response capacity to COVID-19.-IPR builds on Germany’s partnership with UNDP since 2002 through the Employment Generation Programme (EGP) in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip for which Germany has provided more than 100 million Euro so far.-For further information, please contact:-German Representative Office in Ramallah-Hanna Ilge Tel.  +972-2-2977647 – e-mail: wz-2@rama.diplo.de.

Toshimitsu MOTEGI, Foreign Minister of Japan, and H.E. Khaled Al-Osaily, Minister of National Economy, opened today the Palestinian Business and Prosperity Centre at the Jericho Agro-industrial Park in the presence of H.E. Rula Maayah, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, H.E. Jihad Abu Al-Asal, Governor of Jericho, Mr Salem Ghrouf, Mayor of Jericho, UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, Ms Yvonne Helle, and Mr Haytham Wahidi, CEO of the Investment Promotion and Industrial Estate Agency.-The project aims to develop a fully functional and operational innovation business centre at the Jericho Agro-industrial Park to improve competitiveness of Palestinian businesses operating there, and in other industrial parks in the State of Palestine. The PALPRO Centre will also offer support to micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as selected entrepreneurs and start-ups with growth potential.-Following the ribbon cutting ceremony, the two ministers and accompanying high level delegation toured the centre where they were briefed on the services it provides.-Minister of National Economy, H.E. Khaled Al-Osaily, highlighted that the PALPRO centre will be a hub that serves not only JAIP tenants but MSME’s and entrepreneurs across the Palestinian state, especially in the Jordan valley where potential for development and priorities are high. “The peace and prosperity initiative supports the future growth of Palestinian trade and export and the Exclusive Road from JAIP to Shuna will be critical in that regard. I am also pleased to announce that the Deep Well shows good indicators to supply JAIP with water, in addition to other alternative sources, along with the recently installed two megawatt solar energy system that will reduce electricity costs,” His Excellency added.    -The project is part of a comprehensive plan which aims to provide fully functional and operational services to the Jericho Agro-industrial Park (JAIP) and contribute towards Palestinian sustainable economic development and regional stability under the Japan-led “Corridor for Peace and Prosperity” initiative.-H.E. MAGHOSHI Masayuki, Ambassador for the Palestinian Affairs, Representative of Japan to Palestine commented: “Japan in cooperation with all partners aims to utilize PALPRO as a base for the development of the ICT sector. Our intention is that PALPRO will be a distinctive centre assisting regional SMEs and start-ups with high-quality technology and business services in the fields of agri-food, water and renewable energy, technological and business support to established companies and start-ups”. “A vibrant ICT sector has the potential to significantly contribute towards the economic growth of developing nations. Especially in Palestine, the potential of ICT sector is huge with a young and well-educated population. Japan believes that by engaging with young and talented entrepreneurs, we can maximize the potential of the ICT sector in contributing to the growth of national economy,” he added.-The project includes the construction of two additional floors to the JAIP administration building, with an area of approximately 1,200 square meters for each floor, and the provision of state of the art equipment to host the industrial business and innovation centre. The centre includes fully equipped labs (ICT Lab, Food Lab, and Fabrication Lab), three meeting rooms, clinic, cafeteria, common area, co-working spaces, storage area and offices.-The ICT Lab focuses on innovative solutions mainly within the agricultural sector. The Food Testing Lab serves businesses and farmers mostly for testing quality of packaging, food products, soil, fertilizers, water quality, etc., while the Fabrication Lab will be used for prototype development and packaging designed to fit export requirements for regional and international markets.-“The Government of Japan is a true strategic partner for UNDP. This project will accelerate Palestinian industrialization and provide opportunities for entrepreneurs and MSMEs to develop and expand in local and international markets, and contribute to a viable Palestinian economy,” said Yvonne Helle, UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator. “We expect the centre to achieve a self-financing rate of around 60% - 70% at the end of five years from private sources, including service revenues, and the rest originating from donors as well as public and private subsidies,” she added.    -The project will also contribute to strengthening businesses operating at the Jericho Agro-Industrial Park (JAIP) by introducing them to new marketing channels and export opportunities as well as enhancing their capacity to manage their own businesses. It is expected that at least 60 MSMEs and entrepreneurs will benefit from the PALPRO Centre during the pilot phase from April to October 2021.-The JAIP was founded to support the Palestinian Government in establishing a viable Palestinian State with a sustainable economic system for developing Agro-industries, encouraging investment, promoting trade, and creating job opportunities in Jericho city and the Jordan Valley. The park is expected to provide over 3,500 direct job opportunities and generate thousands of workdays upon its completion.-It is worth noting that the Government of Japan is considered one of UNDP’s strongest partners, contributing to improving the lives of the Palestinian people. The Government of Japan has provided more than US$356 million to UNDP/PAPP since 1993 for project implementation in the areas of infrastructure, rubble removal, health, education, agriculture, access to justice, and others.","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,In the news,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Press release,Sustainable development,English,Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People,Japan"

The event offered young people and their families an escape from the destruction and trauma caused by over 14 years of siege, four wars and continuous conflict in Gaza.-EAA and its partners initiated the organisation of this festival, which was facilitated by 50 Al Fakhoora students (Qatar Scholarship Programme) who helped staff six activity stations for the participating children, including sports games, storytelling, a cinema bus and scouting games. A highlight of the day was the football match between Al Fakhoora students top football players and the Stars of Gaza, made up of some of the best players from teams across Gaza.-Talal Al Hothal, Director of EAA’s Al Fakhoora programme, commented: “Children and youth in Gaza have suffered prolonged destruction, loss and trauma, and through #Football4Gaza, we at Education Above All Foundation want to lift their spirits, even for a day. We know how much children love football, and we hope that our programme, which combines physical activity with creative games and special video messages from football and music stars will show this community the world cares about them and about their well-being.  We want to thank our partners UNDP and Generation Amazing for helping us to organise this festival and to carry out our commitment to build up children’s courage and inner strength through sports and entertainment.”-#Football4Gaza’s closing ceremony included video contributions from beIN Sports Commentator, Hafid Derradji, and former Palestinian National Football Team players Mustafa Nijm and Ramzi Saleh.-In addition, Qatar Legacy Ambassadors Ali Al Habsi, Mohammed Saadoun Al Kuwari, Khalid Salman, and Younis Mahmood recorded video messages in support of the children and youth in Gaza; praising their resilience, determination and will power.-Yvonne Helle, UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator, acknowledged the partnership UNDP has with Education Above All Foundation over the past 11 years and reflected on sport being a universal language that has the power to change the world. “The activity today is very much needed in an environment like Gaza where the population, particularly the young, went through loss and difficult experiences over the years. This will alleviate the considerable stress and frustration among children and youth and give the participants the opportunity they deserve to experience the joy and thrill of inquiring, exploring, discovering, learning and engaging with others”.-Since its establishment, EAA’s Al Fakhoora programme has not only provided around 1000 higher education scholarships to youth in Gaza, but further provided psychosocial support for children, youth and educators to equip and support them to recover, achieve their potential and, in time, contribute to post-conflict recovery. EAA’s Qatar Scholarship has developed a distinct and holistic approach to working with children, their families and educators alike, ensuring sustainability and scalability once programmes are complete.-Following the organisation of a successful event, #Football4Gaza will continue to draw global attention to the tragic situation of children and youth in Gaza, and the psychosocial support they need in order to rebuild communities.","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Arab states,foundations,Qatar,Governance and peacebuilding,Press release,English,Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

It was initiated by GMO with the support of UNDP Rwanda and in collaboration with UN WOMEN. Rwanda is the first country in Africa to implement this innovative initiative.
-The nine private companies were awarded with a Golden Gender Equality Seal while one received a silver for having achieved a higher progress in promoting gender equality and accountability in their businesses and workplace. Those include MTN Rwanda, Wolfram Mining and Processing Ltd, Development Bank of Rwanda, ECOBANK, Safari Centre, I&M Bank, SORWATHE, Marriott Hotel and Bank of Kigali. 
-Recognized public institutions and private companies  include the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MINICOM), the National Industrial Research Development Agency (NIRDA), the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA), the Rwanda Cooperative Agency (RCA), Dubai Port World Kigali, Garda World Sanlam General Insurance Company, Sina Gerard-Entreprise Urwibutso, Inkomoko Entrepreneur Development and BRITAM Insurance.   - -These companies and institutions have voluntarily enrolled into the programme and gone through gender self-assessments, developed action plans and started implementing them to address identified gender gaps.-“As an Accountability organ, we strongly believe that no sustainable development can be achieved without participation of both men and women especially in the workplace. Giving equal opportunities to both not only contributes to improving their lives as employees but also increases organizational productivity,” says the Chief Gender Monitor, Rose Rwabuhihi.-The Golden Gender Equality Seal is valid for only three years after which they will go under an advanced evaluation to assess their progress.-These companies were among the first to join the programme. After three years, they were evaluated against gender equality seal standards to assess their progress in honouring their commitments. The evaluation revealed that they have achieved key milestones in promoting gender responsive work environment.-Establishment of breastfeeding rooms at workplace, increasing the number of females in male dominated jobs, increasing the number of females in decision-making positions as a Key Performance Indicator, establishment of a child care facility, putting in place sexual harassment policies, reducing gender pay gaps are among the key achievements they registered in three years of implementation of their gender plans and strategies.- The Resident Representative of UNDP in Rwanda commends efforts accomplished by the companies in promoting gender equality in their businesses, saying that this should serve as a role model to others- “The odds are still stacked against women in the workplace. The public institutions and private companies we are celebrating today are breaking those barriers. It is not just the right thing to do: it will work out for corporate bottom line and society at large,” noted Mr. Maxwell Gomera, the Resident Representative of UNDP in Rwanda.  He added: “This is only the beginning. We need a cultural revolution, right from the education systems, through to flexible working options, sharing caring responsibilities in the home and removing occupational segregation.’-While the private sector currently employs 94% of the labor force in Rwanda as per official statistics, the number of women is still low, especially in technical fields which normally pay more wages.-For instance, in mining women participation stands at 9 %, transport and storage at 3% and at 17 % in construction. Also, Women occupy only 32% of decision-making positions in the private sector and only 33% of business enterprises are owned by women, most of whom own micro and small business enterprises. The Gender Equality Seal Programme was initiate to bridge those gaps and increase business growth.-“The GES has steered business and economic growth and increased organizational performance. It has also helped to enhance the ability of companies to attract more talent and retain best employees. I take this opportunity to encourage companies that have not yet joined the programme to do so. The sustainable future of our businesses is not possible without gender equality,” said Robert Bafakulera, the Chairperson of Rwanda’s Private Sector Federation.-This recognition and certification ceremony was organised in the framework of the celebrating the International Women’s Day, which observed yearly on 8th Mach.-“In this world of uncertainty and Covid 19 recovery and resilience processes, the role of the private sector in boosting Rwanda’s economy is paramount.  As part of this vital work, UN Women appreciates not only the private sector companies’ commitments to gender equality and Women’s empowerment but also concrete actions taken in this endeavour by the companies that we are here  to recognise today and award for their efforts in putting the commitments into actions. We encourage many more companies to join this transformative initiative, challenge the status quo and boost an inclusive socioeconomic development of the country,” says Emma Carine Uwantege, Acting Country Representative of UN WOMEN in Rwanda. She further adds that “One UN through the complementarity and experience of our two agencies (UNDP and UN Women) will continue to be leveraged to provide a solid framework and concrete tools to support private sector companies’ gender equality agenda.”- This is the certification of first cohort of nine private companies and the recognition of the third cohort of private companies and public institutions for their progress and commitment in bridging the gender equality gaps across their business and area of work. Since the inception of this innovative programme, 24 private companies and 6 public institutions have joined the initiative.

In conflict-affected states, for example, rape is often used as a strategy of warfare to undermine the enemy and to demoralize and destabilize communities.-Colonel (Rtd) Rutaremara urged that everyone has a role to play in fighting GBV. “Prevention of and response to SGBV deserves the closest attention of each and every one of us – from individuals to communities and states. Security actors should therefore be equipped with knowledge and skills to enable them to effectively prevent and respond to SGBV thus the essence of this training programme,” he said.-The Director of the Rwanda Peace Academy added that GBV prevention measures should be integrated into national and international policies and strategies. “Effective prevention of SGBV can only be possible if women and men’s concerns and experiences are integrated into the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes.”-The official opening of the course coincided with the launching of the 2021/2022 Project on Strengthening the Capacities of the Rwanda Peace Academy, which is a Regional Peacekeeping Training and Research Institution under the Rwanda’s Ministry of Defence.- - -Under this partnership, the Government of Japan through UNDP have provided a new financial support worth $210,000 that will enhance the capacity development of regional security sector actors in conflict prevention, conflict management and resolution as well as peacebuilding.-In addition to the SGBV course, four more training courses will be delivered under this project.-“The Government of Japan and the UNDP support African-led peace support activities that build and foster institutions for conflict prevention and sustainable peace.

It will help to accelerate the transition from petrol-fuelled motors which accounts from more than 80% of the total motorcycle population in Rwanda, to electric ones. It will also help to achieve Rwanda’s target to become a carbon neutral economy by 2050.
-Rwanda’s Third National Communication submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, by 2018, informed that greenhouse gas emissions from road transport were dominated by cars and motorcycles. Ongoing studies for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory under Rwanda’s Initial Biennial Update Report show that the taxi motorcycles are the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions estimating at 427.45 Gg CO2 e.g. (32.42% emissions from road traffic).
-Moreover, according to the Ministry of Infrastructure, Rwanda counts more than 100,000 motorbikes officially registered as of 2021, with 46000 operating as moto-taxis. The city of Kigali alone counts 26,000 of moto-taxi, releasing more gases which pollute the atmosphere and negatively effects human health and the environment.-Seeking for solutions to address this issue, the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) partnered with a private local company, Rwanda Electric Mobility (REM Ltd) to launch a pilot phase in the city of Kigali, with the financial and technical support from UNDP Rwanda through the Poverty Environment Action for SDGs (PEA) Project.-“Addressing air pollution is not only a priority to the environment and climate change but also to the health of the population. Pilot projects such as these, will help us to know the best approaches and technologies to take forward to contribute to air pollution and greenhouses in Rwanda that responds to the country’s commitment at national and International level to achieve submitted National Determined Contributions to UNFCCC” Director General of REMA, Juliet Kabera- -Mr Maxwell Gomera, the Resident Representative of UNDP Rwanda, applauds the initiative and reiterates UNDP’s commitment to support the country’s efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels in the transport sector.
-“Rwanda is debunking the myth that a country has to choose between development and green growth. Using a smart combination of finance and policy, we are pioneering a vision of development without fossil fuels, effectively detoxing our transportation system,” said Gomera, adding that “Burning fossil fuels causes pollution, respiratory diseases and costs money over time. Going electric zaps those problems before they can cause damage, putting our economy and society on a greener, healthier pathway.”-During the six-month pilot phase, 80 motorcycles will be retrofitted. Thereafter, retrofitting services will be available to motorcycle owners across capital Kigali on a relatively affordable cost.  
-According to REM Ltd, retrofitting e-moto will cost no more than $ 850 USD, costing far less than current petrol incumbents.
-Donald Rukotana Kabanda, the CEO REM Ltd explained that retrofit e-motors will generate more economic benefits than petrol-fuelled ones. “The retrofitted e-motors are equipped with two batteries, which may be also portable. One full charge costs Rwf 900 and covers 50km of a trip while one litre of petrol costs more than Rwf 1000 and covers 25km. This means that a retrofit e-motor-taxi operator will save more than Rwf 100 per charge compared to petrol-fuelled motor-taxi,” Kabanda elucidates.
- Retrofitting or electric conversion involves removing the entire internal combustion engine from a vehicle, installing an electric one in its place, and adding a bank of electric batteries, which makes it less pollutant. Only old used motorbike of 3 years and above will be retrofitted; making them almost brand new as all spare parts used to retrofit it are originally new.- -At least 40% of motorcycles, especially the moto-taxi fleet can be applied to this program. The REM projects to retrofit up to 30,000 motorcycles in the next 5 years.-The project is aligned with Rwanda’s policy and ten-year climate plan (Nationally Determined Contribution to Paris Agreement) to reduce 4.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 and with Rwanda’s National Strategy for Transformation (NST1 2017-2024) as well as Sustainable Development Goal number three (SDG 3) on good health and well-being.",['Icon of SDG 03'],"Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Press release,Rwanda,English"

I was to find out that she was surprised, not by the fact of me consulting her, but that I could not pick from any number of starting points she thought available on achieving gender equality. -‘The gender equality bar is too low, dad.’ She said. ‘The current starting point is: let’s have equal rights for women!’ -‘I cannot believe that in 2021, equal rights for women is an actual position that I or anyone has to take.’ She went on. -Women are demanding more rights than men. No.-Women are not even demanding superior rights to men. They just want equal opportunity and access... that should not be a controversial statement!’-‘Like one person says, hey let’s have equal rights for women and another says, no! I disagree!’-This conversation with my daughter represents the state of our world today and an indictment of our generation. -How is it that in 2021, we have not quite settled the issue of equal rights and equal opportunity for men and women?-The ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman, a boy or a girl, a mother or a father, need to be reassessed and redefined for gender equality to move forward.-That is why today we are celebrating these ten Champions.-We look forward to accompanying you in your journey towards achieving gender equality in the workplace.-The companies we are celebrating today have taken the bold step of recognising the value of gender equality in business and are committing to eliminate all forms of gender-based inequality and discrimination.-I congratulate you and I strongly believe your decisions today will make a positive impact on your company’s productivity, profitability and market share. -Let me also express my sincere gratitude to the Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) and the Private Sector Federation for championing this cause and helping unleash the incredible power in women and girls. The National Strategy for transformation (NST1) has put the private sector at the center of economic transformation. It is difficult to see how that can be achieved without the incredible power and resourcefulness that women and girls can bring.-As you move forward in this journey, please consider UNDP an ally. At UNDP we rolled out globally the Gender equality seal for both the public and the private sector as a mechanism tackling gender inequalities at the workplace with a focus on key six dimensions: eliminating gender pay gap, increasing women’s roles in decision-making, enhancing work-life balance, enhancing women’s/men’s access to non-traditional jobs, eradicating sexual harassment at work and using inclusive, non-sexist communication.-It is a work that is bearing fruit.-I would like therefore to invite companies both public and private, which have not yet adopted mechanisms for gender accountability at the workplace to adopt them.-A few years ago, someone said to me social order is negotiated order. Through the stories that we tell, we are constantly negotiating our order and reality. We are shaping our world view and reality. -The challenge for my daughter will remain until we improve the stories that shape the social position of women and girls. In order to advance equality, we need sustained efforts to first improve the social position of women and girls.-So today, I will leave you with three challenges to reflect on:-1.    First, the gaping hole where fathers should be in the domestic sphere has consequences for women. We need men to be champions at the household level and to tell new and different stories about the role and potential of their girl children. As individuals, local influential people and institutions that hold power to influence change in the lives of women and girls, what can you do to ensure that from an early age, boys understand that it’s OK to do the dishes, it’s OK to cook, its ok to show emotion?-2.    Second, it seems to me addressing the gender equality change also requires that men are as likely to take time off to look after children as women; Looking after children is not an unproductive labour. Is it time for both parents to see child rearing as a joint venture?-3.    Third, how do we make the work-place more child friendly? We have emerging examples from Rwanda. A few weeks ago, I learnt from a Champion whose work I most admire, the CEO of BRD Kampeta Sayinzoga, that her new offices include space for child playgrounds. That is not cosmetic undertaking. A 2015 report found 54,000 new mothers lose their jobs across Britain every year. While the gender pay gap is small among young women, it widens dramatically as women hit their child-rearing years and still stands at 18.4% for all full- and part-time workers. -Murakoze Cyane(Thank you very much)!- -Read more about the recognition event: Private firms urged to sign up for gender equality seal program",['Icon of SDG 05'],"Africa,Speeches,Rwanda,Goal 5  Gender equality,partnerships,Gender equality,English"

The initiative aims at empowering persons with disabilities in Rwanda for them to achieve their full potential.-The launch of this initiative took place at HVP Gatagara which is the main rehabilitation Center in the Country. It is part of the celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities celebrated every December. The initiative echoes this year’s theme “Building back better: toward a disability-inclusive, accessible and sustainable post COVID-19 world.”-The Disability Inclusion Initiative is aligned with the UN’s principle of “Living no one behind” streamlined in Agenda 2030.- - -Introduction of smart boards and internet in HVP Gatagara schools-On the occasion, UNDP partnered with Liquid Telecom to provide 10 smart boards to HVP Gatagara schools as well as free internet as a way of scaling up the smart classroom* promoted by the Government of Rwanda.-The Director of HVP Gatagara, Frere Kizito Misago said that smart boards and internet connectivity are of great importance for both the children with disabilities and their teachers. “As technology advances, people with disabilities should not be excluded. We are appreciative of this support because the internet will help children and teachers to do research on various subjects and stay connected,” said Kizito adding that “When teachers use a chalk-board, children, especially those with mental health problems are distracted; the smart boards are the right tools do tackle this issue for students will be more attentive and curious to follow their teacher.”-Frere Kizito commended the continued support of UN agencies, especially UNDP to promote disability inclusion and ensure that rights of persons with disability are respected and protected.- -Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Maxwell Gomera, the UNDP Resident Representative in Rwanda echoed Frere Kizito’s statement on how these innovative tools are going to positively impact on education of children with disabilities. “Being connected can make a difference in the lives of Rwandans living with disabilities in the way they access broadband, they access the education materials. So, I am pleased that together with Liquid Telecom, we are committing to provide access to the benefits of the internet to children at HVP Gatagara,""said Mr. Gomera.-With the support of the Rwanda Education Board, the smart boards will enable easier access to national curricula online modules hence ensuring equitable access to education for all particularly students with disabilities.-Children with disabilities require not only adapted learning tools but also ensuring that these children basic needs are duly catered for. Therefore, through the disability inclusion initiative, UNFPA Rwanda handed over 3000 sanitary pads to HVP Gatagara to ensure adequate menstrual hygiene and improved access to sanitation for young girls with disabilities.-Overall, the disability inclusion initiative calls on different stakeholders mainly the public sector, the private sector, civil society organizations, development partners and the UN in Rwanda to contribute towards decent living conditions for persons with disabilities. It is also calling for innovative partnerships bringing together the comparative advantage of each actor to find sustainable solutions for the empowerment of persons with disabilities.-The UN Resident Coordinator Dr. Fode Ndiaye commended the Government of Rwanda and National Council for People with Disabilities for remarkable efforts in promoting inclusion. He reiterated UN’s support to ensure that disability inclusion is promoted trough all development sectors, national policies and strategies.-“I strongly believe that this could build better citizen, making sure people have access to equal opportunities and contribute better to social and economic development of their country. We will continue to work with the government and support the required frameworks to ensure that the rights of people with disabilities are respected and promoted,” said the UN Resident Coordinator, Mr. Fode Ndiaye.-Globally, persons with disabilities constitute around 15% of the population which should not be left behind to achieve the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.- -* A smart classroom is a technology-enhanced classroom that foster opportunities for teaching and learning by integrating learning technology, such as computers and interactive screens, specialized software, audience response technology, assistive listening devices, networking, and audio-visual capabilities. In a smart classroom, a black/green chalk-board is replaced by an interactive white screen on which teachers and students write using a specific pen or a finger.","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 4  Quality education,News,English,Burundi,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

His family depends on subsistence farming, growing mainly beans, cassava, maize, sorghum and sweet potatoes. He is concerned about the consequences of climate change that the region has been experiencing due to the degradation and destruction of ecosystem.-“We are experiencing a significant reduction in precipitations, which also has negatively affected our agricultural productivity and health,” said Gasangwa.-Amayaga region is composed of four districts, including Kamonyi, Ruhango, Nyanza and Gisagara. Residents of these districts state that their region covered large patches of natural and planted forests rich in plants and home to a variety of animal and bird species. These forests harbour carbon stocks and provide critical watershed services to the agricultural landscapes surrounding them. Today, a big part the forests has almost disappeared. The remnant are natural and scattered indigenous forests covering 555ha.-Agricultural expansion and overharvesting of the forests have been among the major causes of this environmental crisis. In addition, the lack of adequate mechanisms and financial capacity to restore and protect biodiversity in Amayaga exacerbated the situation.-The degradation of biodiversity in this region has brought many consequences, including soil erosion and land degradation which resulted in decreased agricultural productivity, endangerment or disappearance of some fauna and flora species.-The alarming level of threat to biodiversity and to the Amayaga region inhabitants prompted the Government of Rwanda to work with partners to adopt stringent mechanisms, including the establishment of an ambitious initiative aiming at restoring forest landscape of Amayaga region and improve the livelihood of its inhabitants and create green jobs.-Green Amayaga initiative-The Green Amayaga or Forest Landscape Restoration in the Amayaga region, is a six-year initiative that seeks to promote biodiversity, foster ecosystem services, increase agricultural productivity and reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystem to the adverse effects of climate change.- - -The US $32.7m (RWF 31.9b) ambitious project was designed by UNDP in partnership with Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) and with financial support from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) with the aim of contributing to the implementation of the National Strategy for Transformation (NST-1) and the Nationally Determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. It is being implemented in four districts: Kamonyi, Ruhango, Nyanza and Gisagara districts, by the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) in partnership with the Rwanda Forestry Authority (RFA).-The project was officially launched on 23 October 2020 in Nyanza District and coincided with the national event to launch the annual forest planting season in Rwanda.-“This ground-breaking project is part of Rwanda’s efforts to increase our resilience to climate change by investing in nature-based solutions. When it comes to adapting to the warming of our planet, Mother Nature is our best ally. Restoring forests and landscapes will not only benefit our environment, but also improve the health and livelihoods of Rwandans and create green jobs.We are looking forward to seeing the Amayaga region green once again,” said Rwanda’s Minister of Environment, Jeanne d’Arc Mujawamariya.-Eight million of trees will be planted to restore degraded forests. Fruit trees will be planted on 25,000ha to increase agro-forestation, improve productivity and well-being of inhabitants of the four districts. The project propels and fast tracks the Government’s plan to maintain forest cover to 30.4% of the country’s total land area into the future.-The Green Amayaga project will increase the erosion control and protection of marshlands and buffer zones to foster agriculture productivity.-Nyirahabimana Josee 39, a resident of Muyira Sector, Nyanza district commended the initiative saying that erosion control brings hope. She has been a victim of soil erosion for long as her land is located on a steep hill. “Last year, I suffered a big loss when heavy rains washed away 80% of my crops. It has become normal to lose land portions due to erosion since our land are located on hills,” explains Nyirahabima who adds “This project is a great opportunity for me as I will get double benefit. Not only it will help me to control erosion on my soil but I will also plant fruit trees to increase productivity and wellbeing of my three children.”- - -“By integrating a climate investment lens to our work, we can create a new type of farming – carbon farming – potentially more lucrative and sustainable than traditional crops,” said Maxwell Gomera, UNDP Resident Representative in Rwanda.-In total, 263,000 hectares of agricultural land will be restored and rehabilitated. Small and large watersheds will also be rehabilitated and restored to provide water for human consumption as well as livestock and agriculture activities. The project will strengthen the resilience of communities and biodiversity and contribute to climate change stabilization.-Overall, 1.3 million persons from Gisagara, Nyanza, Kamonyi, and Ruhango districts will benefits from the project, including 362,000 direct beneficiaries. The project will create green jobs for people, over 90% of them being youth and women.-7,500 households will be provided with small livestock to increase livelihoods resilience of local communities in four districts. 60,000 households will be provided with improved and energy-efficient cooking stoves to decrease wood consumption by at least 25%.-“The Green Amayaga project is yet another example of the Government and people of Rwanda’s remarkable levels of preparedness and creativity. Restoring biodiversity and landscapes is not just good sense in these extraordinary times, it is imperative. When biodiversity thrives, we all thrive,” said Maxwell.-UNDP has been working with the Government of Rwanda and other partners to address development challenges by supporting various programmes and initiative aimed at increasing social and economic resilience and achieve sustainable development.-Reiterating UNDP’s support to green growth initiatives and solutions, Maxwell said “I would like to reaffirm UNDP’s commitment to strengthening our partnership for building back a better economy and society, one that will combat climate change and unsustainable management of the environment and improve the wealth and livelihoods of the people of Rwanda.""","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 1  No poverty,Rwanda,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 13  Climate action,News,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

And this is our commitment to you: Your voice matters and should be heard. UNDP is a place where your opinion and your ideas count.-In 2021, we are going to invest in strengthening your ability to write, including opinion pieces and on storytelling. Because your work and your stories are extraordinary and must be heard.-Let me leave you with three insights I picked up this year that have enriched me as a person-FIRST is the importance of being creative and curious about the world around you.-Keep asking questions: of us, of yourself, of your work and the world around you.-It does not matter where you seat in the organisation, never lose the ability to be curious about your work and the world around you.-Ideas are the greatest ‘leveller’ in an increasingly unequal world – and the only piece of property that is truly and uniquely you.-SECOND is the importance of timely execution, of not procrastinating, of not leaving until tomorrow what can be done today.-Ten days ago, I was talking to my sister-in-law and making plans for Christmas.-We did not finish the conversation but agreed to pick up on it the following day.-I did not follow up immediately.-Two days later, at about 08:30 my daughter called to inform me that my sister-in-law had died in her sleep.-I will never have the chance to discuss Christmas with her – or to tell her how much I love her.-So, colleagues do not leave until tomorrow what you can do today.-Last is the importance of sharing our humanity.-We truly find humanity in surprising places.-Two months ago, I was at my lowest point. I lost a son; I was moving away from my family; I was anxious about the country and the job I was stepping into.-But, in you I found friendship and family. And that has helped me to settle and focus on the job. I have had the pleasure of learning from you in the past few weeks – and to interact with all levels of staff.-Godelieve Mukayiranga, regularly shares uplifting reflections with me as she drives me around – helping to start our day on a high note. To my delight, her thoughtfulness is shared across the organisation.-I have been introduced to many wonderful aspects of Rwanda culture and society. I have been invited into your homes where I have tasted Rwandan food, and even tasted the local brew ‘Urwagwa.’-Through you, I want to thank your families, the people who support you everyday and are our biggest cheerleaders. They make sacrifices so you can do what you do for UNDP and Rwanda best. They are the true heroes of our journey. I hope this annual break helps you rejuvenate and wish you and your families happy holidays, peace and prosperity.-Stephen Hawking once said: ‘I have led an extraordinary life on this planet, but it would be an empty universe indeed if it were not for the people I love, and who love me.

With its ambitious new Digital Strategy 2022-2025, UNDP aims to get ahead of the ever-evolving digital reality to accelerate work towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).- -As one of the three enablers of its new Strategic Plan, digitalization will help UNDP meet its ambitious goals. That includes supporting 100 million people to escape poverty and assisting 500 million people to gain access to clean energy. Digital technology can advance democracy and human rights by boosting civic engagement and political participation, for instance. Or consider digital public goods that countries can use for identification, data exchange, and payments while reducing opportunities for corruption. And artificial intelligence and digital technology could bring a 10-20% reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.- -“Digital technologies are driving new ways of working and thinking while opening-up opportunities that we could not have imagined,” says UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “For instance, it can assist policymakers to better understand how our natural world -- such as forests, coral reefs, or glaciers -- are changing in real-time and where to take action. Look at UNDP’s Data Futures Platform for example, it provides policymakers with the latest data and analytics to inform key areas like vaccine inequity.”- -UNDP is already supporting communities to develop and use digital technology to surface a wide range of much-needed development solutions. In the space of just one year, UNDP assisted 82 countries to adopt over 580 digital solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included everything from leveraging digital finance to facilitate cash transfers to people unable to leave their homes during lockdowns; to helping countries develop digital readiness assessments; to providing robots that are serving in COVID-19 wards.- -“Over the past year, demand has grown among our partners to provide strategic support on national-level digital transformation,” says Robert Opp, UNDP’s Chief Digital Officer. “At present, UNDP is supporting 35 countries on their digital transformation journey – a strong signal in the trust and confidence placed in our organization to provide the cutting-edge support needed.”- -The strategy will also help guide the organization in its efforts to tackle the emerging challenges associated with our new digital world. If left unchecked, digital technology can exacerbate existing inequalities and reinforce biases. And while some progress has been made in closing the digital divide, 2.9 billion people – mostly in developing countries, and mostly women, remain without access to the Internet. “We’re committed to a rights-based, whole-of-society approach to digital transformation that leaves no one behind. We want to make digital work for everyone, everywhere – this generation, and future ones,” added Robert Opp.- -The strategy outlines how UNDP will assist countries in reaping the benefits of digital technology with a three-pronged approach:- -·       First, UNDP will amplify development outcomes by embedding digital into its work; experimenting with new approaches and tools, scaling promising solutions, and applying foresight to understand possible futures.-·       Second, it will support societies in their efforts to create more inclusive and resilient digital ecosystems, ensuring they are rights-based and leave no one behind.-·       And third, UNDP will continue to transform and lead by example to meet current and future technological needs. That means prompting  #FutureSmartUNDP personnel to continue upgrading their digital skills and using data strategically – helping to future proof the organization.-UNDP will also engage with global and local businesses and entrepreneurs, academics, researchers, young people, and policymakers to foster collaboration around the responsible and sustainable use of technology. This necessary conversation will feed into the work of the UNDP Accelerator Labs network as it surfaces and scales up local development solutions – many of which are digital.- -Anchored in the UN Secretary-General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and the framework presented in the Our Common Agenda report, the strategy complements the UN's global efforts to expand access to affordable broadband and enhance the digital capacity of key groups includeng women and people with disabilities – ultimately creating new opportunities like jobs while boosting human development.- -“This latest Digital Strategy demonstrates that UNDP will not stand still. With the Global Goals serving as our guiding stars, we are looking beyond the immediate horizon to help ensure digital futures for everyone,” added Achim Steiner.- -More information at: https://digitalstrategy.undp.org/",[],Press release

This is four times the amount being called for to help poor countries tackle the climate crisis, one of the sticking points ahead of the COP26 global climate conference next week, according to new UN Development Programme (UNDP) research released today.-The amount spent directly on these subsidies could pay for COVID-19 vaccinations for every person in the world, or pay for three times the annual amount needed to eradicate global extreme poverty. When indirect costs, including costs to the environment, are factored into these subsidies, the figure rises to almost US$6 trillion, according to data published recently by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).-Instead, UNDP’s analysis highlights that these funds, paid for by taxpayers, end up deepening inequality and impeding action on climate change.-""The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed outdated aspects of the global economy. It includes the fact that the world continues to spend billions of dollars on fossil fuel subsidies, while hundreds of millions of people live in poverty and the climate crisis accelerates. Against this backdrop, we must ask ourselves: is subsidizing fossil fuels a rational use of public money?"" said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. -Fossil fuel subsidies are both inefficient and inequitable. Across developing countries, about half of the amount of public resources spent to support fossil fuel consumption benefits the richest 20 percent of the population, according to the IMF.-“Addressing fossil fuel subsidies is a politically charged issue, but the facts show that reform is both necessary, and when done correctly, supports the poor, creates jobs, and protects the planet,” said George Gray Molina, Lead Economist of UNDP’s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support and co-author of the research. “We hope this research will catalyze the conversation on the critical role reform can have in driving green and fair transitions in all countries.”-The report, published ahead of the upcoming G20 and COP26 meetings, is being launched in the context of a growing recognition of the need for reform of fossil fuel subsidies by economists and policymakers as well as the IMF and World Bank. The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also made a strong call for reform.-To spotlight the hugely negative effects fossil fuel subsidies have on people and planet, UNDP has produced an engaging short film as part of a new campaign in which one of the world’s most well-known extinct animals, the dinosaur, gives a speech to the UN General Assembly urging world leaders to shift away from fossil fuel subsidies and “Don’t Choose Extinction.”-Led by a cast of celebrity voices from around the world — the Don’t Choose Extinction campaign aims to raise public awareness of how fossil fuel subsidies are canceling out significant progress to date towards ending climate change and are driving inequality by benefitting the rich.-The main contributor to the climate emergency is the energy sector which accounts for 73 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel subsidy reforms would contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and benefit human health and well-being, and they are a first step towards correctly pricing energy – one that reflects the ‘true’ and full cost of using fossil fuels to society and the environment.-But UNDP’s analysis shows that fossil fuel subsidy reforms can also be unfair and harmful for households and society if they are poorly designed. While fossil fuel subsidies tend to be an unequalising tool - as the lion’s share of the benefits concentrate among the rich - these subsidies also represent an important portion of poor peoples’ incomes that otherwise must be paid for energy consumption. Fossil fuel subsidies’ removal thus could easily become an income- and energy-impoverishing strategy. This contributes to making fossil fuels reform difficult, and imposes a key barrier to transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources.-With that in mind, UNDP’s research advocates for a progressive and gradual response to reforms. It includes analysis of success stories gathered from several countries across regions as well offering a ‘toolkit’ for policymakers to support fossil fuel subsidy and energy pricing reforms. The toolkit allows for a phased approach that is just and equitable and includes income protection and compensation for less advantaged groups.-“When we consider how we are going to pay for the fight against climate change, fossil fuel subsidies mean that we are effectively starting at a point of minus US 423 billion dollars,” added Achim Steiner. “Reform is not easy and  the transition to clean energy presents a range of difficult challenges in many countries. Indeed, each country needs to take their own path. But we also know that we must move away from these energy sources that are contributing to our planet’s decline. Ending financial support for them in a way that is fair and equitable is a critical element of that transition. The recent IPCC report, which the UN Secretary-General described as a ‘code red’ for humanity, shows that only the most ambitious climate action will limit global warming to1.5 degree Celsius. This is what science dictates is needed to avoid a climate catastrophe.”-The Don’t Choose Extinction campaign features a collective intelligence platform, the Global Mindpool, to help tackle the most important issues of our time. Linking insights from around the world - on the climate emergency, the crisis in nature and inequality – the Global Mindpool will support UNDP to better inform and equip policy makers in government, civil society, and the private sector.-For more information on the ‘Don’t Choose Extinction’ campaign, visit www.dontchooseextinction.com-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

It is a step to support Saudi youth, develop the national creative capacities, and reinforce their sense of national responsibility. Therefore, the competition contributes to developing practical solutions that support the Kingdom`s new orientation and helps the youth realize the significance of their role in developing their country and leading its future.-Over 100 participants of young Saudi men and women from Misk fellows, who joined Human Capital Development programs, will work together to identify current challenges, find innovative solutions to overcome them, and leave behind a long-lasting and tangible impact.-Misk Fellowship Annual Competition consists of three main stages. It begins with a three-day virtual training program, followed by the initiation and development stage, and finally, the assessment stage where nominated projects are selected. These presented projects should include creative solutions for SDGs challenges in four areas: social challenges, economic challenges, environmental challenges, and empowerment factors. After that, participants will have a rich journey to guide them and help them to develop their ideas and visions.-Seventeen teams were nominated to work in the coming period with leaders of mentors and experts to develop their solutions and achievements until they reach the final stage, which will be held in mid October this year. It will include the final evaluation by the assessment committee and the selection of the winning projects that succeeded in making a positive impact. The winning projects will receive cooperative training opportunities with the partners.-Misk Human Capital Development program also works on preparing participants of youth and provide them with the required experience and skills to deal with the different developmental challenges. To achieve that, they will take various training courses delivered by specialists from the Ministry of Economy & Planning and UNDP as well as experts from Bain & Company which is one of the best management consulting companies in the world.-It should be noted that “Misk Fellowship” has been working since its launch in 2017 on discovering, developing, and building a Saudi youth network to compete globally, reinforce their of sense identity, and make a positive economic and social impact for Saudi Arabia.- ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Saudi Arabia,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 15  Life on land,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Sustainable Development Goals,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Goal 4  Quality education,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 14  Life below water,UNDP,Press release,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

- -The report, Temporary Basic Income: Protecting Poor and Vulnerable People in Developing Countries estimates that it would cost from $199 billion per month to provide a time-bound, guaranteed basic income to the 2.7 billion people living below or just above the poverty line in 132 developing countries.- -The report concludes that the measure is feasible and urgently needed, with the pandemic now spreading at a rate of more than 1.5 million new cases per week, particularly in developing countries, where seven out of ten workers make a living through informal markets and cannot earn money if they are at home.- -Many of the huge numbers of people not covered by social insurance programmes are informal workers, low-waged, women and young people, refugees and migrants, and people with disabilities – and they are the ones hardest hit by this crisis. UNDP has carried out assessments on the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 in more than 60 countries in the past few months and the evidence shows that workers who are not covered by social protection cannot stay at home without an income.- -A Temporary Basic Income would give them the means to buy food and pay for health and education expenses. It is also financially within reach: a six-month Temporary Basic Income, for example, would require just 12 percent of the total financial response to COVID-19 expected in 2020, or the equivalent of one-third of what developing countries owe in external debt payments in 2020.- -“Unprecedented times call for unprecedented social and economic measures. Introducing a Temporary Basic Income for the world’s poorest people has emerged as one option. This might have seemed impossible just a few months ago,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.- -“Bailouts and recovery plans cannot only focus on big markets and big business. A Temporary Basic Income might enable governments to give people in lockdown a financial lifeline, inject cash back into local economies to help keep small businesses afloat, and slow the devastating spread of COVID-19,” he said.- -A Temporary Basic Income is not a silver bullet solution to the economic hardship this pandemic has brought, however. Protecting jobs, expanding support to micro, small and medium enterprises, and using digital solutions to identify and access people who are excluded, are all measures that countries can take.- -One way for countries to pay for a Temporary Basic Income would be to repurpose the funds they would use this year to service their debt. Developing and emerging economies will spend $3.1 trillion in debt repayment this year, according to official data. A comprehensive debt standstill for all developing countries, as called for by the UN Secretary-General, would allow countries to temporarily repurpose these funds into emergency measures to combat the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.
- -Several countries have already taken steps to introduce Temporary Basic Incomes. The government of Togo has distributed over $19.5 million in monthly financial aid to over 12 percent of the population through its cash transfer programme, mostly to women who work in the informal sector. Spain recently approved a monthly budget of €250 million to top up the incomes of 850,000 vulnerable families and 2.3 million individuals up to a minimum threshold.- -COVID-19 has exacerbated existing global and national inequalities and has created new disparities that are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest. With up to 100 million more people being pushed into extreme poverty in 2020, 1.4 billion children affected by school closures, and record-level unemployment and loss of livelihoods, UNDP predicts that global human development is on course to decline this year for the first time since the concept was introduced.- -UNDP is the socio-economic lead for the UN system on COVID-19 recovery and is implementing social and economic recovery strategies in countries across the world.- -###  ###  ###- -UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Now that progress is at risk.- -The data, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), shows that 65 out of 75 countries studied significantly reduced their multidimensional poverty levels between 2000 and 2019.- -Sierra Leone made the fastest progress in reducing their global MPI value. It is one of seven Sub-Saharan African countries in the top ten fastest-moving countries, alongside Côte D’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda and Sao Tome and Principe.- -India saw the most people moving out of multidimensional poverty – some 270 million people between 2005/6 and 2015/16. 70 million people in China left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014. In Bangladesh, numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019. - -“COVID-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape. But this data – from before the pandemic – is a message of hope. Past success stories on how to tackle the many ways people experience poverty in their daily lives, can show how to build back better and improve the lives of millions,” says Sabina Alkire, Director of OPHI at the University of Oxford.  - -Addressing Multidimensional Poverty in a post-COVID-19 world- -While data is not yet available to measure the rise of global multidimensional poverty after the pandemic, simulations for 70 countries in the developing world, based on the anticipated impacts of the virus on just two components of the global MPI – nutrition and school attendance – suggests how much impact the crisis could have unless it is addressed.- -In three scenarios of varying deterioration in which 10, 25 and 50 percent of people who are multidimensionally poor or vulnerable become undernourished, and half of primary school-aged children no longer attend school, poverty levels could be set back 8 to 10 years.  But even if we look only at the impact on nutrition, if anticipated increases in undernutrition are not prevented or swiftly reversed, the setback could range between 3–6 years.  - -“COVID-19 is the latest crisis to hit the globe, and climate change all but guarantees more will follow soon. Each will affect the poor in multiple ways. More than ever, we need to work on tackling poverty – and vulnerability to poverty - in all its forms. This is why the Multidimensional Poverty Index is so important” says Pedro Conçeicão, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP.”- -Among the 1.3 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty today, more than 80 percent are deprived in at least five of the ten indicators used to measure health, education and living standards in the global MPI. The data also reveals that the burden of multidimensional poverty disproportionately falls on children. Half of the 1.3 billion poor have not yet turned 18. While 107 million are 60 or older.- -“The MPI – with its information on both the level and composition of poverty – provides the data needed to pinpoint where and how poverty manifests itself. Otherwise policymakers are flying blind, unable to know how – or where – to target resources and interventions,” adds Alkire.- -For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 55 percent of the population (558 million people) is multidimensionally poor. Of these, 98 percent (547 million people) do not have access to clean cooking fuel, 84 percent (470 million people) lack access to electricity and 66 percent (366 million people) do not have access to clean drinking water.- -Addressing each challenge requires a different approach, many of which need to go beyond improving income. This is particularly true in the light of UNDP’s work encouraging societies everywhere to take the opportunity to rethink development pathways and “build back better” post-COVID.- -Access full data and publication: http://hdr.undp.org/en/2020-MPI- -***",['Icon of SDG 01'],"Coronavirus COVID-19,Press release,Goal 1  No poverty"

UNDP is working closely with national institutions, as well as with media and civic actors, to help the fight against the spread of disinformation and misinformation, including supporting initiatives to use social media and websites to spread accurate information on COVID-19.-Advice about COVID-19 changes swiftly as medical understanding evolves, and this rapid evolution and the crippling impact on lives and livelihoods have led to a public thirst for information. Social media, informal news sources and fringe journalism have filled the void, often sowing fear, stigmatization, discrimination and confusion.-“The tsunami of fake cures, scapegoating, conspiracy theories, and false news stories that has flooded media in general and online platforms in particular has created a chaotic information environment — one that is not only undermining the effectiveness of public health measures, but also leading to real life violence and discrimination, confusion, fear and, arguably, long-term societal harm,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.-“Learning the lessons from HIV and Ebola, we must join forces to reject misinformation and stigma, anchoring our responses and advocacy in science, evidence, human rights and solidarity. While many actors bear a responsibility to counter misinformation, real progress will not be achieved without government leadership,” Steiner added.-The challenge today is that disinformation and misinformation tools and tactics are now literally at the fingertips of anyone who wants to co-opt COVID-19 for their own agenda, including government agencies. For example, researchers at the Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzed 112 million public social media posts related to the pandemic and found that 40 per cent came from unreliable sources, and that almost 42 per cent of over 178 million tweets related to COVID-19 were by bots. Meanwhile, Reuters Institute found that around a third of social media users have reported seeing false or misleading information about the coronavirus, while research by Pew suggests that people who receive their news primarily through social media are more likely to be exposed to false content.-In Somalia, where some of the most influential voices are sheikhs and imams (religious leaders), UNDP joined with the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs for a three-day campaign in Mogadishu, led by Shekih Ali Dheere and other senior figures. Videos and social media graphics have reached around a million people on social media and are being used for TV and radio spots.-UNDP is also supporting Somalia’s Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs to set up a website that will provide guidelines for safe burial techniques and help mobilize the religious community to donate and deliver supplies like masks and soap and to host various information resources. UNDP set up the first Somali coronavirus website and partnered with Somalia’s biggest telecom provider, Hormuud, to deliver a recorded message on millions of phones with useful COVID-19 info and directions to the site.-In Lebanon, UNDP, in partnership with the Ministry of Information, WHO and UNICEF, launched a national campaign to counter the spread of false information, to reduce public vulnerability to information pollution and to build government capacity to counter it. A fact-checking site is being developed and an awareness campaign was launched to encourage the public to stop and think before sharing information.-In Guinea-Bissau, UNDP and the Ministry of Health supported the development of a fact-checking site (www.nobaschecker.org), which helps Lusophone citizens access trustworthy information on COVID-19. By building a wide community of fact-checking journalists, doctors, and economists from Guinea-Bissau and around the world, the site aims to fight disinformation around the pandemic by providing facts and verified news.-Since the beginning of the pandemic, UNDP has also been collaborating with UNESCO's Sector for Communication and Information, which has published a series of policy briefs, research papers and practical guides for journalists to navigate disinformation and promote freedom of expression and access to information.-“The best weapons any government can deploy now are transparency, diplomacy and collaboration. Governments can lead by example, demonstrating how to use technology with integrity. They can negotiate with big tech companies, promote national digital literacy campaigns, sponsor fact-checking efforts and allow journalists to do their jobs. This investment will pay off many times over in the form of inclusive and informed societies and engaged citizens,” said Malin Herwig, Director, ai, of UNDP’s Oslo Governance Centre.-“There is very little to gain for governments that conceal information, suppress opinion or sow divisions around COVID-19. In the immediate future, it will lead to overwhelmed health systems, angry and befuddled citizens, overstretched security forces and deepening divisions and inequalities. In the long term, it will continue to erode democratic values and principles, human rights and social cohesion,” Herwig added.-Last week, the United Nations launched ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of COVID-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information. It will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger.

Each has hit human development hard but, overall, development gains accrued globally year-on-year,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. “COVID-19 – with its triple hit to health, education, and income – may change this trend.”-Declines in fundamental areas of human development are being felt across most countries - rich and poor - in every region.-COVID-19’s global death toll has exceeded 300,000 people, while the global per capita income this year is expected to fall by four per cent.-With school closures, UNDP estimates of the “effective out-of-school rate”—the percentage of primary school-age children, adjusted to reflect those without Internet access—indicate that 60 per cent of children are not getting an education, leading to global levels not seen since the 1980s.-The combined impact of these shocks could signify the largest reversal in human development on record.-This is not counting other significant effects, for instance, in the progress towards gender equality. The negative impacts on women and girls span economic - earning and saving less and greater job insecurity -, reproductive health, unpaid care work and gender-based violence.-COVID-19: a magnifying glass for inequalities-The drop in human development is expected to be much higher in developing countries that are less able to cope with the pandemic’s social and economic fallout than richer nations.-In education, with schools closed and stark divides in access to online learning, UNDP estimates show that 86 percent of children in primary education are now effectively out-of-school in countries with low human development—compared with just 20 percent in countries with very high human development.-But with more equitable Internet access, - where countries close the gap with leaders in their development group, something feasible – the current gaps in education could close.-Determined, equity-focused interventions can help economies and societies rally, mitigating the far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.- -“This crisis shows that if we fail to bring equity into the policy toolkit, many will fall further behind. This is particularly important for the ‘new necessities’ of the 21st century, such as access to the Internet, which is helping us to benefit from tele-education, tele-medicine, and to work from home,” says Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office at UNDP.-Implementing equity-focused approaches would be affordable. For instance, closing the gap in access to the Internet for low- and middle-income countries is estimated to cost just one per cent of the extraordinary fiscal support packages the world has so far committed to respond to COVID-19.-The importance of equity is emphasized in the United Nations’ framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19 crisis, which sets out a green, gender-equal, good governance baseline from which to build a ‘new normal”. It recommends five priority steps to tackle the complexity of this crisis: protecting health systems and services; ramping up social protection; protecting jobs, small- and medium-sized businesses and informal sector workers; making macroeconomic policies work for everyone; and promoting peace, good governance and trust to build social cohesion. UNDP calls on the international community to rapidly invest in the ability of developing countries to follow these steps.-***-Link to “Human Development Perspectives COVID-19: Assessing the impact, envisioning the recovery” : http://hdr.undp.org/en/hdp-covid-For more information and media interviews, contact:-Adam Cathro; adam.cathro@undp.org; +1 212 906 5326-Anna Ortubia anna.ortubia@undp.org +1 646 642 4071-__________________________________-ABOUT UNDP:-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Let me thank my friends at KAPSARC for inviting me to deliver this keynote address on behalf of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).-After 25 years in the UN system and with many years in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Palestine, and Uganda, I truly thought I had seen it all. COVID 19 has shaken all of us to the bone. The world has literally stopped on so many fronts.-A couple of years ago I was working in the Horn of Africa and I recall so many farmers and pastoralists saying, ‘normally, we have rain now...normally, the soil would be fertile. Normally, our herds of camels and goats would be healthy...’ -But that notion of NORMAL had not existed for years in the Horn due to successive drought and subsequent floods. People like to hang on to the past --- to seemingly better days.-Globally, collectively, we are in that same situation. There is NO normal to go back to. We cannot return to business as usual after COVID.-The plight of millions of the destitute, of refugees, of displaced persons, of homeless, of the hungry, of those caught in war, have marched on without pause. Their situations have gotten considerably worse.-This is a moment for change and while immensely stressful and complex, opportunities are emerging and it is no surprise that the community of Think Tanks brought together today under the leadership of KAPSARC and the T20 will be instrumental in that change!-But where will they fit? How can Think Tanks contribute as we move from Crisis to Stabilization?-Let me back up a bit and describe where the UN sits in all of this:-I am quite proud to inform you that the United Nations family has come together to present a plan of action called “Shared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19”. In it the UN Secretary-General calls for a large-scale, coordinated, comprehensive multilateral response that amounts to at least 10 per cent of global GDP. All in all, this unprecedented crisis hits weaker countries more severely. The IMF estimates that 2.5 trillion USD are needed globally to tackle this challenge.-The program of the UN has 5 critical workstreams:-1. ensuring that essential health services are still available and protecting health systems;-2. helping people cope with adversity, through social protection and basic services;-3. protecting jobs, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and informal sector workers through economic response and recovery programmes;-4. guiding the necessary surge in fiscal and financial stimulus to make macroeconomic policies work for the most vulnerable and strengthening multilateral and regional responses; and-5. promoting social cohesion and investing in community-led resilience and response systems.-These 5 workstreams of the UN are inextricably linked to the work of the G20. Through its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia had already made plans for massive domestic transformation and now that agenda is carrying over into its role globally.  With the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the presidency of the G20, it is its time to shine. However, it has to face the so called double whammy of low oil prices AND the corona virus!-Saudi Arabia must show leadership in these turbulent times just as you, the research community, will have to lead ---to offer science based factual guidance to the international community.-Investments must compliment the UN’s health and humanitarian response.-They must be investments in resilience and in the recognition embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that all life on this planet is inter- connected and that no single individual should be left behind.-UNDP, my agency, will focus on three immediate priorities: (1) health systems support (in close partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) , (2) inclusive and integrated crisis management and support (in close partnership with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and, (3) social and economic impact needs assessment and response (the area in which UNDP has the technical lead in the UN).-The magnitude of COVID will require UNDP to lean on a corporate initiative launched last year to help drive innovation and multidisciplinary effort – a collection of 60 Accelerator Labs in 78 UNDP country offices, five of which are G20 countries : Argentina, India, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey.-The UNDP Accelerator Labs are the fastest learning global network on development challenges. We are now recruiting for a second cohort of 30 labs to be based in UNDP around the world. We use the power of the crowd, machine learning and distributed decision making to support partners to understand problems, develop new solutions, promote more inclusive decision making, and provide better oversight of what is done.-UNDP is identifying grassroots solutions and stretching their potential to accelerate development. -We apply experimentation closely with government partners to grow this as a mode of operating to reduce costs of large-scale public sector reforms.-Experimentation helps us learn whether particular assumptions are accurate before deploying solutions at scale, especially in the rapidly evolving contexts that often dominate development progress. -With their three-pronged approach of EXPLORATION, SOLUTIONS MAPPING, and EXPERIMENTATION, the Accelerator Labs represent UNDPs ‘global disaggregated think tank’ and are thus a natural counterpart to all of you!-Let me now offer some suggestion on areas where I feel you, the research community, can contribute to the COVID response whether through the channel of the T20 and the G20 or more broadly.-The areas of intervention requiring scientific rigor and engagement are enormous -so let me highlight areas that have a multiplicative impact and ones inextricably linked to the Sustainable Development Goals.-In no particular order and with job creation as a guiding beacon ,-First, environmental sustainability- we have been pillaging our magnificent planet at a speed that is devastating. Think Tanks must promote nature-based solutions for development.-Second, make clear the linkages between nature and health. For example, carbon storage benefits, water supply and purification, soil quality, eco-friendly recreation.-Third, gender equality- women are disproportionately impacted by COVID and are already disadvantaged globally. They are over-represented in the health sector, are a majority in the informal sector, and are more often victims of violence and exploitation. Moreover, they are often excluded in the design and implementation phases of research as well as product development.-Fourth, innovations in education...this would include means of educating, training of teachers, production of accessible learning materials, distance learning in remote impoverished locations.-Fifth, and the hosts of today’s event will recognize the importance of this item- closing the energy gap and diversifying energy usage and models.-Sixth, Food security – with transport linkages disrupted and in many cases, broken, how do we fight hunger? How do we encourage and provide good science behind local production and local consumption?-Seventh, e-Commerce and digital solutions- COVID has demonstrated that internet connectivity and the ability of businesses to shift to electronic means for transactions have been crucial to survival.-Finally, eighth, and my colleague from OECD may speak to this - is the need for research and innovation on the shift from funding to financing . In fact, long before COVID landed in our lives, the Crown Prince himself said the biggest single challenge to achieving the 2030 development agenda and its goal of ‘leaving no one behind’ was FINANCING.-The Saudi Presidency of the G20 is taking that to heart by prioritizing a Multi-Year Framework on Financing Sustainable Development so the most vulnerable do not endure development setbacks and gains made on the SDGs are not sacrificed.-A stronger focus on financing sustainable development linked to the COVID response, including in the provision of universal health coverage, gives an opportunity to the Saudi Presidency to establish a truly meaningful legacy at the Riyadh Summit.-In closing, let me wish you all well and encourage you to be bold, be vocal, but to also be humble. If the corona virus has taught us anything, it is that we are closer to one another than ever before imagined ... socially, politically, and economically.-So, while the title of this session tells us that times are turbulent , necessity is, after all, the mother of invention!-Thank You.- - - ",[],"Sustainable Development Goals,Coronavirus COVID-19,Innovation,Saudi Arabia,Adam C.

With this training, we are now well informed to detect disaster risks and early warnings. This training has enriched our knowledge on disaster risk management skills,” says Chief Idriss Kargbo of Dixing Chiefdom, Kambia District. -Over 200 participants from 16 chiefdoms have benefitted from a disaster management training that has leaped into the establishment of sixteen (16) Chiefdom Disaster Management Committees (CDMCs) in Kambia and Pujehun Districts with support from UNDP in collaboration with the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA). Targeted chiefdoms were earmarked and selected after thorough assessment of their vulnerabilities in terms of disaster shocks. These committees now comprised community members at chiefdom level including chiefs, market women, bike riders, teachers, military and police personnel, and members of other social networks within the community.-During session on the Standard Operating Procedure of Disaster Management, early warning signs and adaptation measure were identified at community level; community early warning focal person selected; community knowledge based on local early warning signs were improved; targeted community members fully understood community practices on traditional early warning activities; community risk mapping exercise by stakeholders and the production of risks map on hazards in targeted communities were accomplished- subsidizing knowledge with informed strategies to help build community resilience towards sustainable development and disaster risk management.-Facilitated by UNDP and NDMA experts, the training has bolster over 200 community members with improved capability and required aptitude to take leadership positions and champion disaster risks reduction and management within vulnerable communities through inclusive participations.-This intervention aims to enhance community capacity on risks reduction and foster commitments in achieving CDMCs’ role before, during and after emerging disaster within the piloted chiefdoms (Dixing, Magbema, Knonimakha, Bramaia, Masongabla, Mambolo, Samu, Manuthalah, Kpange, Malen, Kpange Krim and Kpaka, Mano Sakrim, Yekemo Kpukumu Krim, Gallines and Sorogbema), requiring broad-based actions from Government and commitments of local councils within its sphere of responsibilities to formulate and review contingency action plans. Similarly, the approach provides a list of major executive actions that are involved in responding to natural disasters coupled with the requisite actions for preparedness, response and relief that are to be tapped into to accelerate the understanding of CDMCs’ members.-“This training provides us an opportunity to sketch our own community risks and capturing disaster prone areas has enormously broaden our knowledge and prepared us for future hazards. The training has also helped communities within the respective chiefdoms with the capacity to tackle and be in preparedness to defeat emerging outbreaks,” says A.S.P Kenawa John Squire, Community Relations and Media Officer-Pujehun Police Division-All 16 CDMCs have identified defined roles and responsibilities to guide them in their preparedness to mitigate subsequent disasters through early responses and recovery activities.-Funding from UNDP had earlier reviewed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CDMCs to reflect the interest of communities and other emerging issues on disaster risk reduction to save lives and properties; which is also a viable tool rolled out  to guide the designated persons- lays down, in a comprehensive manner, the specific actions required to be taken by various CDMCs, Chiefs, Local Councils, ministries and departments of Government, District and Chiefdom Administrations for responding to natural disasters of any magnitude and dimension.

As Sierra Leone continues to join the global team to celebrate our 8th custom edition of this Summit, a series of activities have been identified to commemorate this year’s event that continues to focus on identifying young positive deviants living within communities and motivating them to play a more active role in identifying possible innovative means of fast-tracking the achievement of national development objectives and the SDGs by 2030. This celebration will be climaxed with the ‘National Youth Recognition Awards’ which will be given to outstanding young Sierra Leoneans across the country.-The Government of Sierra Leone through the Ministry of Youth Affairs in collaboration with National Youth Commission, National Youth Service, Directorate of Science Technology and Innovation, United Nations Agencies and Private Sector Partners is using this national platform to:-❖Give young people the opportunity to showcase their ideas, creativity and use of technology to solve community development challenges.-❖Recognise young people who with their meagre resources have invested in developing community support programmes/interventions that have created a positive change in the lives of people around them.-The Social Good Summit has always had a catalytic impact in Sierra Leone as winners of previous awards have contributed remarkably towards the development in Sierra Leone. The male prize winners for 2020, Samuel Mattia and Martin Dainbaquee, who presented solutions on hydroponics and rechargeable poultry hatchery respectively are currently undergoing testing in readiness for scale-up investment with the UNDP Accelerator Lab. While the female prize winners, Yembeh Kargbo and Susan Fatu Tarawally, including three SGS Youth Ambassadors, are currently part of the Youth Empowerment Employment Programme and are supported by UNDP to scale up their businesses.-This year’s event will be aligned with the Global International Youth Day theme ‘Transforming Food Systems: Youth Innovation for Planetary Health’. This theme couldn’t be better suited to the current situation we find ourselves in the world today with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sierra Leone, we are facing challenges of low productivity, lack of improved agricultural practices, lack of use of technology, and the adverse effects of traditional agricultural practices on the environment have led to inefficient food systems and food insecurity affecting predominantly youth. This year’s local theme for the Social Good Summit 2021 will be ‘Lɛ wi fɛn idia pan Agrikɔlchɔ fɔ mɛk Salone Food ɛn ɛnvironmɛnt sikur’ (Let us Innovate in Agriculture for Food Security & Sustainable Environment in Sierra Leone).-There will be three categories of challenges this year:-1.              Youth Innovation Competition in Agriculture focuses on innovative solutions on improving agricultural productivity and food systems, while considering the protection of the environment at large. The Awards will be gender-based, with a male and female winner and runner-up selected. The winning prize will be LE20,000,000, while the runner-up prizes (Male and Female categories)-2.              Youth Assistive Technologies for People with Disabilities Innovation Competition focuses on solutions that help or enable people living with disabilities to fulfil their potential. There will be a Winner and Runner-up Award Prize given. The winning prize of LE20,000,000; Runner-up prize of LE10,000,000-3.              Youth Impact Competition seeks to identify young people that are doing something in their community that has made a difference and a positive impact to the lives of people. This Award seeks to identify 5 successful young people from each region (North, North-West, South, East & West) that will be granted the title of ‘Youth Ambassadors” for 2021. The winning prize for each Ambassador will be LE10,000,000.-The submission of application forms is open for 1 month, between 16th September - 15th October 2021.

This support aims to intensify ground-level community engagements to counter rumours and misinformation, and increase uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.-The composition of the mobilisers includes ward committee members, religious leaders, ‘keke’ and bike riders, persons with disabilities, women, and youth leaders who can be easily identified within communities in their UNDP/NaCOVERC ‘Corona fet na we all fet’ branded T-shirts.-According to NaCOVERC, hesitancy still exists around coronavirus vaccines. There are many instances where communities need assurance for uptake, which they would get, especially when engaged by people from within the same communities through the reasoning that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. -Since the virus struck over a year ago, the world, including Sierra Leone, has not only seen death and morbidity but also slowdown in general economic activities leading to recession. All these have negatively impacted on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).-For UNDP Resident Representative Pa Lamin Beyai, NaCOVERC should use this opportunity to work closely with community leaders, potential pioneers of change, to ensure that all persons 18 years old and above are vaccinated. Pa Lamin also commended the leadership of NaCOVERC, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, development partners, and the Government of Sierra Leone for taking up this important and timely campaign.
-“This is why UNDP has partnered with NaCOVERC and the Government in support of Government ’s ongoing mass vaccination campaign, without leaving anyone behind,” he assured.-Early May 2020, following the announcement of mandatory use of face masks in public, UNDP partnered with NaCOVERC on a similar approach and equipped 940 community volunteers and deployed them in 190 chiefdoms around the country to raise public awareness on COVID-19 while showing solidarity.-Community interventions, no matter how vital, cannot be pushed into communities without proper information preceding them. UNDP wasted no time on NaCOVERC’s Public Information, Risk Communication and Social Mobilisation (PIRCSM) Pillar request to support the “vaccine boosters”.-NaCOVERC and the Government of Sierra Leone and its partners have made considerable efforts to strengthen health systems to fight against COVID-19 and contain the virus. Despite the gains, achieving some form of herd immunity is difficult to reach, especially considering the country’s current trend of vaccination rate. Less than 5% of the population has been fully vaccinated. Against this background, vaccination campaigns should focus on translating the high levels of stated acceptance into actual uptake of vaccines.-Therefore, the 402 mobilisers and supervisors are intensifying community engagement/mobilisation through ward-level door-to-door visits, trained to deliver key messages on COVID-19 Vaccines while calling citizens to action.-Total financial resources UNDP has allocated for this support is One Billion Two Hundred and Fifty-Four Million Six Hundred Thousand Leones (Le 1,254,600,000), complementing initial COVID-19 support to the Government and People of Sierra Leone. - ","['Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Africa,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Health,News,Sierra Leone,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

He ended by assuring UNDP that SLMET would use the equipment and all other supports to reach out to coastal communities in a bid to tackling the issues emanating from coastal zones. 
-The EPA Deputy Director, Natural Resources Management Department, Paul A. Lamin also extended his appreciation for the support from UNDP.-“I must confirm that there are huge gaps in ensuring service delivery at the EPA, but the equipment provided by the UNDP will mitigate such gaps and enhance service delivery in terms of capacity building. UNDP has not only provided material support to the EPA; it has also provided technical capacity in improving the work we do,” he said.-This support to the two Agencies is totaling the sum of $ 360,732 under project component to transfer technologies for climate and environmental monitoring infrastructure for climate resilient development and adaptation to climate change as part of a regional initiative that includes 11 countries in Africa.- ","['Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 15  Life on land,English,News,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

Our engagement with UNDP and MRU has brought interventions that are changing our lives,” says Bintu Swarray- Secretary of Women’s of Mano River Organisation at Jendema. -In Sierra Leone, 65% of traders that are involved in cross-border trading along formal crossing points are women. When the Jendema/Bo Waterside Border was closed in 2020 after the index Covid-19 case in the region, trading fare increased exponentially. Women had to travel informal crossing points and risky routes like on canoes to trade and get their livelihood. Also, studies have shown that Covid-19 restrictions and regulations on border trade have degenerated women’s economic condition which increases economic hardship. Therefore, the statistical difference between men versus women border traders within the border communities, could infer that more women using the formal crossing points are exposed to unimaginable economic effect especially when trade activities are limited by border closure. -This initiative provides support to women and youth through UNDP’s core funds in response to Covid-19.

Held in Koinadugu District on 29th April 2021, this engagement was a consultative round-table that attracted participation from 7 districts (Koinadugu, Kenema, Kono, pujehun, Tonkolili, Fabala and Kambia), triggering discussions leaping into how youth could be meaningfully engaged in decision making processes. -“This one-day dialogue forum proved that young people are aware of issues affecting their inclusion in decision making processes which are mainly centered around social, political and cultural issues. They strongly believe such dialogue sessions will help challenge negative stereotypes of young people, help break down barriers between adults and young people, enhance their self-confidence and belief so that they can exercise positive career choices and have greater involvement and responsibility in the future,’’ says Musu Bangura, UNDP Gender Analyst, Governance Cluster.-Eight out of every 10 individuals in Sierra Leone are below age 35. Therefore, the country is gifted with the energy, and viable networks with high social capital that could easily transcend and contribute positively to national development, and in diverse ways, to maintaining social cohesion and peace, in spite of the structural challenges militating against young people. What has been slow to emerge is young people’s positive engagement with formal structures in a bid to establish identity. Recent skirmishes of minority disaffected young people (bike riders) in the country resorted to a subculture that puts them on a collision course with security personnel and police.
-The one-day consultative and dialogue session has triggered frank discussions among Sierra Leonean youth who strongly believe that their needs and aspirations have not been met by national and local political structures but are hopeful that regular engagements and involvement of young people into local and national decision making process/structures and conversations could be catalytic to fuel behavioral and social change in their communities.-UNDP Sierra Leone has found handy two approaches as meaningful and tangible ways to improving young people’s participation in parliament, local councils and in decision making processes at different levels:-1.       The upstream approach to review and amend legal and procedural frameworks that inhibit young people’s participation in decision making; and-2.       The downstream level to target community and regional leaders’ buy-in, establishing platforms that facilitate engagements between and among young people, policy makers, politicians, CSOs and community leaders.-Facilitated by UNDP, gender drivers against women’s equal participation in political and community decision making process, and grass root solution mapping through innovation formed part of two key presentations, provoking interactive group sessions.  The former emphasized that young people especially women who make up the youthful population be included in the decision-making processes for meaningful contribution. The latter delineate how UNDP ‘issue mapping’ tool, a simple collective intelligence tool could be employed to respond to youth exclusion in decision making process at the same time pinpointing how youth involvement is critical in proffering local solutions through innovation. UNDP therefore calls on all young people in Sierra Leone to grab opportunities made available through the UNDP Accelerator Lab and unleash their youthful potential. -Interesting insights from our engagement in Koinadugu District has also revealed that youth’s knowledge on the indispensability of local councils in delivering basic services to community is enormous, but are of the opinion that creating an enabling environment for youth inclusion and active participation in both national or local decision-making processes should be expedited to accelerate service delivery.  -“UNDP & Ministry of Youth initiative of dialoguing with youth is reminding us our role as partners to the development of our various communities. We should embrace this opportunity and make meaningful contribution going forward,’’ says Pujehun District Youth Chairman- Brima Fullah.-In 2020, complimenting efforts to mitigate youth exclusion and trifling participation in decision-making processes, UNDP secured funds from its funding widow to support project entitled ‘Strengthening of Youth Meaningful Participation in Decision Making Structures in Sierra Leone’. This project seeks to address the challenges-including capacity gaps of government and civil society actors, in formulating, implementing and partnering for youth and gender-friendly policies that would ensure meaningful youth engagement and contribution at both local and national levels, in skills training, key among others.  -“UNDP has been the key driver when it comes to youth empowerment in Sierra Leone. Youth capacity building is very important which is why, in our youth policy, we factored in youth inclusion in the decision-making process. The support of UNDP to youth innovation through the Accelerator Lab has created a platform for youth participation in nation building. So, I entreat every youth that is present here today to take this process with absolutely seriousness,’’ says Youth Ministry Director- Charles Moinina.-During the round-table dialogue session, participants made meaningful contributions which have bolstered these youth who are expected to return to their districts and be more actively involved in their local structures and challenge vices to youth inclusion in decision making process.-Youth inclusion in the decision-making processes will not only contribute to their well-being, but to nation building and youth vibrancy. They (youth) believe that the youthful population of Sierra Leone is huge, therefore, if harnessed properly by total inclusion in decision making, will help society fulfills its goals.-The consultative dialogue and round table session ended in a fashion that has set the stage further with expectations from youth, policy makers, district councils, local leaders and CSOs.   -The represented institutions include the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Local Councils, and the Sierra Leone Parliament.

Accordingly, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with other partners is helping to ensure that this hope turns to reality.-On March 29, UNDP’s Africa Regional Director Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa announced the organization’s package of $3 million United States Dollars in grant to support the AfCFTA.-In line with the events, on April 07th 2021, UNDP and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission launched a Training of Trainers programme for participants in the ECOWAS region in Freetown, Sierra Leone for the eventual strengthening of the capacities of women small and medium enterprise traders and producers in the region to better harness the opportunities and benefits presented by the AfCFTA open market agreement.-The Capacity Building Programme named Maximizing Opportunities in the African Continental Free Trade Area will run from 7-9 April in Freetown, Sierra Leone, particularly commits to enhancing the capability of women and youth in the ECOWAS region to take charge of the AfCFTA. The Training is for Trainers to acquire skills and knowledge which they will further share among their peers and community members to make the most and best of trade opportunities within the newly created One African Market brought about by the AfCFTA Agreement.-The Market will generate opportunities for SME traders, producers, service providers and investors in the region by providing access to cheaper input sources, scaling businesses, increased exports (especially of value-added products), and through the development of the much-needed beneficial regional value chain.-With mostly women and youth participants, the training-of-trainers’ sessions comprised of:-Representing Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa, the Assistant Secretary General and Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa, at the opening of the training, the UNDP Resident Representative in Sierra Leone, Pa Lamin Beyai remarked that, “in partnership with other sister agencies such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre (ITC), we will articulate the AfCFTA Agreement, highlight the requirements for exports to various African countries, discuss e-commerce as a tool for exploring new markets, and provide an overview of financing instruments available to SMEs for cross- border trade”. “As a development-oriented organization keen to deliver on its capacity building programmes in maximizing opportunities so that no one is left behind, UNDP commits to supporting the implementation of the Agreement, and will continue to work with ECOWAS and other partners not only in the delivery of this training for trainers, but also in other broader partnership areas to make the AfCFTA Agreement work tangibly for the targeted groups in the ECOWAS region” he added.-The AfCFTA will create an African market for goods and services covering 1.2billion people and a combined Gross Domestic Product of US$3 trillion, building on the progress towards integration achieved in regional economic communities such as ECOWAS.-According to Her Excellency Finda Koroma, the Vice President of ECOWAS, “within the AfCFTA market, there are opportunities for traders, producers, service providers and investors originating in the ECOWAS region to source cheaper inputs, scale businesses, increase exports, especially of value-added products, and develop beneficial regional value chains”.-UNDP’s support to AfCFTA Agreement mainly focuses on women and youth empowerment as these are the “two groups which have the ability to lead and drive Africa’s economic transformation in pursuit of progressive liberalization of services which prioritize five areas – business development, Information Communication and Technology, financial services, transport and tourism which will unlock important high-value opportunities for production, work, and trade within the continent” according to UNDP’s Resident Representative in Sierra Leone.-The represented organizations (including the United Nations Agencies, development partners, civil society, private sector and media) and participants will commit to organizing a minimum of three AfCFTA awareness workshops in their countries, through the ECOWAS Commission.-                                                                 # # #-Note to Editors:-The AfCFTA is a legal instrument that creates an African market for goods and services through the elimination of tariffs, the removal of non-tariff barriers, liberalisation of services, and cooperation in customs arrangements and other regulation.-All ECOWAS member States have signed the AfCFTA Agreement, and 12 of 15 member States have deposited instruments of ratification.

The country has a Gender Inequality Index-GII value of 0.644, ranking it 153 out of 162 countries in the 2018 Index. Sierra Leone 2015 Housing and Population Survey and other studies indicated that more women than men are unemployed, poor, illiterate and are sexually assaulted. The country has some of the worse forms of Gender Based Violence in rural and urban communities. Structural gaps and systemic barriers have worsened the conditions and position of women and girls in the country, deepening the gender gap and poverty in the country.-To understand the drivers and the structural gaps of these inequalities, UNDP consulted groups of women and men in hard to reach communities that are impoverished in Sierra Leone. A cross section of UNDP Gender Focal Team (GFT), led by the Gender Analyst, Kadiatu Bachalle-Taylor engaged district stakeholders (chiefs, district councils, women and youth groups, and persons with disabilities, to garner information from community groups in Kailahun, Kambia, Bonthe and Falaba Districts-Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) made up 10 participants per group were held in all targeted districts to further understand the new trends and patterns of gender inequality and the drivers contributing to gender inequalities at household level. The GFT also conducted Key Informant Interview with duty bearers to understand the challenges faced in addressing gender inequality from districts to community levels and accentuate opportunities that UNDP could maximise and challenges that need to be addressed within UNDP programmes in Sierra Leone.-Our FGDs revealed many gender issues that bother on both governance and sustainable livelihood and economic development - revealing that even though women are the ones largely involved in doing some small scale trading in rural communities and farming to sustain their families, yet, they (women) don’t determine how their moneys are being spent;  that most of the women and girls in the communities are single parents who are widowed, adolescent mothers and teenage pregnant girls that have dropped out of school with no trading or technical vocational skill; that there is higher prevalence of Gender Based Violence (GBV) within rural communities. In Kailahun, Kambia and in Bonthe, it was revealed that the lack of schools in villages around chiefdom headquarter town, pornographic videos and compromise of SGBV cases have contributed to the increase in SGBV; most business women iterated that they have lost their initial capital  owing to restrictions set by councils and the government, among others.-In Kukuna, Kambia District, 15 years Mbalu was taken from school and betrothed to her husband when she was less than 15 years old. She was engaged to her partner because her parents were poor and come from Muslim background that prefers to give their daughters hand in marriage. At 25, she is a widow with three children. Mbalu is not educated and has no other skills. She survives by taking some goods from other businesswomen ‘gbarrah’ (native language meaning ‘to take’) to sell and make some profit to run her household. Having lost his brother in law and his wife, Mbalu now suckles her young baby child and children left behind by wife of her brother in law. Mbalu’s story amplifies an outburst of gender stories in rural Sierra Leone that should be taking into consideration as we develop the UNDP GES to ‘whether the storm’- to reach the end of a very difficult situation without too much harm or damage. According to Mbalu, she is hopeful that the new UNDP National Gender Equality Strategy would resonates with women and girls who have suffered the heavy handedness of SGBV.-Information derived from community engagements and FGDs together with stakeholder consultations, and UNDP Staff Survey, informed drafting of UNDP's Gender Equality Strategy for 2021 to 2023. UNDP held the consultations in Freetown with key Implementing Partners from various Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to ensure alignment with Government priorities in the Medium-Term National Development Plan.  Drawn from the 2018-2021 Global Gender Equality Strategy, the ensuing National Gender Equality Strategy (2021-2023) will be rolled out consistent with UNDP Sierra Leone 2021-2023 Country Programme Document (CPD) which succeeded its 2016-2019 Country Programme Document (CPD).

In that regard, the UNDP applauds the efforts of the Government of Sierra Leone in trying to improve on the management of its fishery and marine resources, as it strives to diversify its economy. Grasping this concept of the blue economy is a giant step in the direction given the country’s enormous fishery and maritime potentials.-However, this is by no means an easy task. With its vast coastline of about 406 Km Sierra Leone, remains one of the countries in the Gulf of Guinea with the least capacity to address maritime security and governance challenges. The factors undermining the country’s capacity include weak legal and regulatory environment, lack of human, technological, and infrastructural wherewithal for monitoring and surveillance, and the lack of strong platforms and mechanisms for inter-agency and inter-state cooperation on maritime security. -It is also evident that Sierra Leone’s territorial waters is plagued by a wide array of threats including piracy; armed robbery at sea; illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; trafficking in humans, goods and services; dumping and other environmental crimes. These challenges need to be urgently addressed to improve Sierra Leone’s potential to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. -Given the above, and in line with Policy Custer 2 of Sierra Leone’s Medium-Term National Development Plan (MTNDP) 2019-2023, the UNDP Country Office is supporting activities that seek to capacitate the SLMA for effective monitoring of the Sierra Leone waters. These include developing the country’s maritime legislative framework and investing in joint efforts to tackle maritime criminality and illicit flow of goods and services. These three rehabilitated boats that we are handing over to SLAMA today are part of the UNDP’s support to the government of Sierra Leone effort to address these challenges. I therefore encourage you take good care of the boats and utilize them for the intended purpose.-It is hoped that the effective management of the country’s territorial waters will contribute to the development of the Sierra Leones blue economy which remains largely untapped. On that note, let me take this opportunity to assure you of the UNDP’s commitment to support the Government of Sierra Leone in addressing policy and structural bottlenecks to improve the fishery and maritime sector.-UNDP will continue to support policy and programming that seeks to improve the fishery and maritime sector in Sierra Leone. This year we shall be supporting the SLMA to develop the National Strategic Framework for the blue economy.  -UNDP Sierra Leone looks forward to a continued good working relationship with the Government of Sierra Leone, and relevant stakeholders in the fisher and maritime sector.-Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, for your kind attention.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 14  Life below water,Goal 1  No poverty,Speeches,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

With its ambitious new Digital Strategy 2022-2025, UNDP aims to get ahead of the ever-evolving digital reality to accelerate work towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).- -As one of the three enablers of its new Strategic Plan, digitalization will help UNDP meet its ambitious goals. That includes supporting 100 million people to escape poverty and assisting 500 million people to gain access to clean energy. Digital technology can advance democracy and human rights by boosting civic engagement and political participation, for instance. Or consider digital public goods that countries can use for identification, data exchange, and payments while reducing opportunities for corruption. And artificial intelligence and digital technology could bring a 10-20% reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.- -“Digital technologies are driving new ways of working and thinking while opening-up opportunities that we could not have imagined,” says UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “For instance, it can assist policymakers to better understand how our natural world -- such as forests, coral reefs, or glaciers -- are changing in real-time and where to take action. Look at UNDP’s Data Futures Platform for example, it provides policymakers with the latest data and analytics to inform key areas like vaccine inequity.”- -UNDP is already supporting communities to develop and use digital technology to surface a wide range of much-needed development solutions. In the space of just one year, UNDP assisted 82 countries to adopt over 580 digital solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included everything from leveraging digital finance to facilitate cash transfers to people unable to leave their homes during lockdowns; to helping countries develop digital readiness assessments; to providing robots that are serving in COVID-19 wards.- -“Over the past year, demand has grown among our partners to provide strategic support on national-level digital transformation,” says Robert Opp, UNDP’s Chief Digital Officer. “At present, UNDP is supporting 35 countries on their digital transformation journey – a strong signal in the trust and confidence placed in our organization to provide the cutting-edge support needed.”- -The strategy will also help guide the organization in its efforts to tackle the emerging challenges associated with our new digital world. If left unchecked, digital technology can exacerbate existing inequalities and reinforce biases. And while some progress has been made in closing the digital divide, 2.9 billion people – mostly in developing countries, and mostly women, remain without access to the Internet. “We’re committed to a rights-based, whole-of-society approach to digital transformation that leaves no one behind. We want to make digital work for everyone, everywhere – this generation, and future ones,” added Robert Opp.- -The strategy outlines how UNDP will assist countries in reaping the benefits of digital technology with a three-pronged approach:- -·       First, UNDP will amplify development outcomes by embedding digital into its work; experimenting with new approaches and tools, scaling promising solutions, and applying foresight to understand possible futures.-·       Second, it will support societies in their efforts to create more inclusive and resilient digital ecosystems, ensuring they are rights-based and leave no one behind.-·       And third, UNDP will continue to transform and lead by example to meet current and future technological needs. That means prompting  #FutureSmartUNDP personnel to continue upgrading their digital skills and using data strategically – helping to future proof the organization.-UNDP will also engage with global and local businesses and entrepreneurs, academics, researchers, young people, and policymakers to foster collaboration around the responsible and sustainable use of technology. This necessary conversation will feed into the work of the UNDP Accelerator Labs network as it surfaces and scales up local development solutions – many of which are digital.- -Anchored in the UN Secretary-General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and the framework presented in the Our Common Agenda report, the strategy complements the UN's global efforts to expand access to affordable broadband and enhance the digital capacity of key groups includeng women and people with disabilities – ultimately creating new opportunities like jobs while boosting human development.- -“This latest Digital Strategy demonstrates that UNDP will not stand still. With the Global Goals serving as our guiding stars, we are looking beyond the immediate horizon to help ensure digital futures for everyone,” added Achim Steiner.- -More information at: digitalstrategy.undp.org",[],"Press release,English"

-The report lays out a stark choice for world leaders - take bold steps to reduce the immense pressure that is being exerted on the environment and the natural world, or humanity’s progress will stall.-“Humans wield more power over the planet than ever before. In the wake of COVID-19, record- breaking temperatures and spiraling inequality, it is time to use that power to redefine what we mean by progress, where our carbon and consumption footprints are no longer hidden,” said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.-“As this report shows, no country in the world has yet achieved very high human development without putting immense strain on the planet. But we could be the first generation to right this wrong. That is the next frontier for human development,” he said.-The report argues that as people and planet enter an entirely new geological epoch, the Anthropocene or the Age of Humans, it is time to for all countries to redesign their paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet, and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change.-To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).-By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress.
-With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress. For example, more than 50 countries drop out of the very high human development group, reflecting their dependence on fossil fuels and material footprint.-Despite these adjustments, countries like Costa Rica, Moldova, and Panama move upwards by at least 30 places, recognizing that lighter pressure on the planet is possible.-“The Human Development Report is an important product by the United Nations. In a time where action is needed, the new generation of Human Development Reports, with greater emphasis on the defining issues of our time such as climate change and inequalities, helps us to steer our efforts towards the future we want,” said Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, host country of the launch of the report.-The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.-For example, new estimates project that by 2100 the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather due to climate change each year- a number that could be cut in half if the Paris Agreement on climate change is fully implemented.-And yet fossil fuels are still being subsidized: the full cost to societies of publicly financed subsidies for fossil fuels - including indirect costs - is estimated at over US$5 trillion a year, or 6.5 percent of global GDP, according to International Monetary Fund figures cited in the report.-Reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
-“While humanity has achieved incredible things, it is clear that we have taken our planet for granted,” said Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy Youth. “Across the world young people have spoken up, recognizing that these actions put our collective future at risk. As the 2020 Human Development Report makes clear, we need to transform our relationship with the planet — to make energy and material consumption sustainable, and to ensure every young person is educated and empowered to appreciate the wonders that a healthy world can provide.”-How people experience planetary pressures is tied to how societies work, says Pedro Conceição, Director of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office and lead author of the report, and today, broken societies are putting people and planet on a collision course.-Inequalities within and between countries, with deep roots in colonialism and racism, mean that people who have more capture the benefits of nature and export the costs, the report shows. This chokes opportunities for people who have less and minimizes their ability to do anything about it.
-For example, land stewarded by indigenous peoples in the Amazon absorbs, on a per person basis, the equivalent carbon dioxide of that emitted by the richest 1 percent of people in the world. However, indigenous peoples continue to face hardship, persecution and discrimination, and have little voice in decision-making, according to the report.-And discrimination based on ethnicity frequently leaves communities severely affected and exposed to high environmental risks such as toxic waste or excessive pollution, a trend that is reproduced in urban areas across continents, argue the authors.-According to the report, easing planetary pressures in a way that enables all people to flourish in this new age requires dismantling the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of transformation.-“The next frontier for human development is not about choosing between people or trees; it’s about recognizing, today, that human progress driven by unequal, carbon-intensive growth has run its course,” said Pedro Conceição.-“By tackling inequality, capitalizing on innovation and working with nature, human development could take a transformational step forward to support societies and the planet together,” he said.-To learn more about the 2020 Human Development report and UNDP’s analysis on the experimental Planetary Pressures-Adjusted HDI, visit http://hdr.undp.org/en/2020-report-###-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

-In developing countries, where huge numbers of people have to go out every day to feed their families, social distancing can become impossible, so other forms of preventing transmission are vital (see here for UNDP’s latest analysis and call for a temporary universal basic income to help the poorest deal with the coronavirus).
-Experience from around the world suggests that mask wearing may be among the best ways to contain COVID-19 while daily life continues, but misconceptions about masks have become so prevalent that even those who understand the benefits think twice before wearing them in public. 
-“If you wear a mask in public, you stand out and even your own friends make you feel stupid,” said Heello. “But we should not be ashamed of doing the right thing; we have to educate our people.”
-In addition to the comedy video, UNDP has also engaged, KALA-MAAN, one of the most popular radio talk shows in Somalia, to push the message out. 
-In a fast paced and poetic dialogue, KALA-MAAN’s four-minute drama explores why people don’t like facemasks and encourages them to follow advice from the government and health authorities. 
-“KALA-MAAN is our most popular talk show and we have famous comedians, actors and poets in the team,” said Burhaan Diini Farah, the Director of Radio Kulmiye. 
-“They speak all the different Somali accents and they understand the cultural nuances of every region so everyone relates to them. They are known for giving out serious messages in a very entertaining and funny way.”

This comes as a result of the partnership that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in South Africa through its Biodiversity Finance Initiative Project (BIOFIN), supported by Impact Observatory and the Sustainable Markets Foundation, has forged with the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) and the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) to map the country’s essential life support action areas (ELSAAs). These are critical places where efforts to protect, manage, and restore nature could sustain critical benefits to South Africans, including food and water security, sustainable livelihoods, disaster risk reduction, and carbon sequestration.   -  -Since June 2021, experts in spatial data and systematic conservation planning from across South Africa have met virtually for a series of consultations to develop the country’s ELSAA map based on national priorities and the best available spatial data. The resulting map is a tool that South Africa can use to harmonize land use policies and prioritize regions to protect, avoid loss, restore, reduce pressures, and engage in ecosystem-based urban adaptation.- -“DFFE has developed a Resource Mobilisation Action Plan which identifies areas where environmental fiscal measures are needed. ELSAA feeds into this work and the sector in general and will provide South Africa much-needed information in regard to where its efforts should be directed in relation to how the country manages resources, both financially and in relation to skills and capacity,” Ms Flora Mokgohloa, Deputy Director General, DFFE.- -Mr. Shonisani Munzhedzi, Chief Executive Officer, SANBI notes that “the NBF has a specific target that deals with spatial planning and integrating biodiversity plans into multi-sectoral plans, hence the importance of this ELSAA project. The novel approach of the ELSAA project will assist the country to focus its efforts to achieve targets across a range of policy commitments. The policy commitments are varied and include maintaining ecosystems, restoring degraded ecological infrastructure, expanding the conservation estate, maintaining carbon stocks, and developing the wildlife economy.”- -In the South African context, the ELSAA map was conceived as a “Map for Nature-Positive Action”. The primary purpose of the map will be to unlock or mobilise resources for nature-based actions that are optimised across several policy commitments. At the results-sharing meeting on 12 April, UNDP and its partners will present the final ELSAA map to relevant decision-makers and seek feedback on additional applications for the map.         -                    -“UNDP considers nature as a critical component of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially given that more than half of the SDGs depends on nature. UNDP’s key priority is to continue supporting the South African government and its partners in their efforts to achieve the SDGs by preserving the natural ecosystems that support human well-being and livelihoods,” Dr Ayodele Odusola, Resident Representative, UNDP South Africa.- -South Africa is one of a group of countries, including Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Peru, and Uganda, that are developing these ‘maps of hope’ to meet their goals related to sustainable development, climate change, and biodiversity. This exercise is one of the first of its kind in the world, notable for the live engagement of national experts and scientists to develop a map that reflects South Africa’s national priorities and realities.- -The project attracted broad participation from national agencies and non-governmental organisations. This project has been made possible thanks to the financial support of Impact Observatory and the Sustainable Markets Foundation.- -The map can be accessed here: https://csl.gis.unbc.ca/SouthAfrica_ELSA/

As Africa’s financing requirements for COVID-19 recovery and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are enormous, leveraging social entrepreneurship to address the continent’s development challenges, build back better in post-COVID-19 recovery, and achieve the SDGs and Africa’s Agenda 2063 remain critical.- -COVID-19 has upended livelihoods, damaged business and government balance sheets, and reversed SSA’s development gains and growth prospects over the past two decades. The economy contracted by 1.7% in 2020,[1] pushing 30 million people back into extreme poverty and worsening inequality not only across income groups but also within subnational geographic regions.[2] Although, economic growth turned positive in 2021 to 4%,[3] the African Development Bank estimates that 39 million additional people were pushed into extreme poverty.[4] Furthermore, this growth rate remains far below the levels required to address the increasing incidence of high poverty, unemployment and income inequality.- -The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated the financing gap for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the ambitious SDGs in SSA. While the pre-COVID-19 annual financing gap for the SDGs was estimated at US$200 billion,  estimates show that COVID-19 recovery will cost some additional  US$154 billion.[5]- -The emerging realities on financing development in Africa underpin the imperatives of moving from funding to financing mechanisms.- -Africa is experiencing a crisis of success. Traditionally, this financing would have come from government funding, aid, philanthropy and foreign direct investments. However, as more SSA countries move into middle-income status, aid flows decrease as they become less deserving of aid – a crisis of success. This has led to declining aid to SSA countries that have also been brought about by changing donor priorities, as many traditional aid agencies are shifting from aid to impact investing. Most SSA countries have also borrowed heavily over the last few years to fund infrastructure projects, as evidenced by a pre-pandemic debt level of 50.4% of GDP; which is expected to reach 56% of GDP in 2022.[6]  - -Furthermore, most African countries are vulnerable to the ongoing Ukraine war’s effects because of higher energy and food prices[7] (which will push up inflation further), reduced tourism, and potential difficulty in accessing international capital markets. The conflict has come at a time when most African countries have minimal policy space to counter the effects of the shock. This is likely to intensify socio-economic pressures, public debt vulnerability, and the scarring effects of the pandemic that are confronting millions of households and businesses.- -An emerging lesson from Africa’s development financing strategy is the urgent need for a blended financing modality.  Building an equitable post-COVID-19 recovery in SSA, reducing the SDG financing gap and containing the effects of the war requires SSA to leverage all sources of financing including the private sector and social entrepreneurs - a paradigm shift – from funding to financing.- -Social enterprises are an organizational form that combines entrepreneurial behaviours with the legitimate quest for economic profits while pursuing social and environmental goals. Social enterprises put people and the planet on equal terms with profit. Social entrepreneurs re-invest their economic profits into social and environmental objectives. In this regard, social entrepreneurship can use the Triple Bottom Lines to address Africa’s triple development challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment while simultaneously growing sustainable and profitable businesses.- -This Ministerial Roundtable Discussion on Driving a Social Entrepreneurship Agenda for Africa is to give greater awareness and attention among governments and international development partners to the role of social entrepreneurs.- -The development of the Social Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Africa is still at an embryonic stage. As such, there is no clear policy toward social entrepreneurship in most African countries[8]. This is because little is known about social entrepreneurs, their activities and how they can positively impact communities.  Evidence from Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Kenya shows youth as the drivers of social innovation to solve social challenges.[9]- -Yet, social enterprises provide full-time employment for up to 41 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa.[10]  They provide a positive impact on employment through three channels:- -‐         Skill development: Providing education, running schools or working with youth to provide them with the skills they need to gain and create decent jobs.-‐         Jobs creation: Providing employment or self-employment opportunities, often for those who are marginalised or vulnerable or underserved. Evidence from a British Council study reveals that job creation is aimed by 78% of social enterprises compared to 27% in profit-first businesses.-‐         Enablers: Enabling others to start enterprises and supporting existing businesses, including smallholder farmers, to increase the quality and quantity of jobs they provide. By supporting other entrepreneurs, and developing businesses where commercial and profit-first businesses fail, it fosters a solidarity approach to development.- -There are some good examples of social entrepreneurs in SSA such as Siyafunda Community Technology Centres (CTC) in South Africa,[11] Wecyclers[12] in Nigeria and Green Bio Energy (GBE)[13] in Uganda among others.- -(i)                 Siyafunda CTC provides a network of community centres that extend access to computers, the Internet and digital technologies to local communities where such access may be lacking. It also provides accredited digital ICT courses and skills training, business and entrepreneurial skills development, adult literacy programmes and e-learning facilities.-(ii)              Wecyclers provides convenient recycling services in densely populated urban neighbourhoods. Wecyclers is a rewards-for-recycling platform that incentivizes people in low-income communities to capture value from recyclable waste.-(iii)            GBE designs produces and distributes innovative energy solutions to fight poverty, deforestation, and climate change. GBE emphasizes prevalent gender issues affecting women as they are typically the ‘managers of household energy’ and are by far the main beneficiaries of GBE’s products and services.- -The UNDP’s Low-Cost Internet Access, using White Spectrum Technology (in partnership with Council for Scientific Industrial Research, CSIR), in four provinces which we intend to expand to 10 more communities by the end of 2022 is one of the examples of social entrepreneurship stimulated by international development partners. The British Council’s support for the development of Social Enterprise Networks and the mapping of social entrepreneurs in Ghana is another good example.- -To provide investor intelligence for the private sector to take advantage of opportunities and align their investments with the SDGs/development needs, UNDP has developed a market intelligence tool - the SDGs Investor Maps that translates development needs into tangible investment opportunities. This market intelligence helps identify Investment Opportunity Areas (IOAs) at the intersection of national development needs and policy priorities.[14] UNDP also developed the complementary SDG Impact Standards,[15] which are the only management standards in the market that embed sustainability at the core of an organization holistically, and guide the private sector to make management decisions to optimize interrelated economic, social and environmental impacts – the triple bottom lines.- -These maps have been completed in 19 countries globally - seven in SSA countries, namely Djibouti, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. An analysis shows that energy (solar, wind and biomass), agricultural crops and processing, housing, and water and sanitation present the greatest opportunities. This initiative is being rolled out in eight countries[16] and it is expected to start in another four countries[17]. Some dividends are already emerging: in Colombia, a major financial institution is exploring financing possibilities; in Indonesia, it is serving as a tool for blended financing options to improve affordability; in Ghana, it helped an impact intermediary to identify a base value of USD 39 millions of potential investments in 15 Small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs); and in South Africa, it facilitated business to business engagement between South Africa and Japanese companies with seven South African SMEs benefiting from Government support.- -Despite these positive employment and social impact,  the UNDP’s experience from SDGs Impact Investment Mapping on the continent reveal that social entrepreneurs in Africa face several challenges including:-(i)              Difficulty in sourcing viable investments that meet financial,  social, and environmental objectives,-(ii)             Limited innovative fund and deal structures among  exiting investments,-(iii)           Limited capacity of sustainable social enterprises and entrepreneurs,  -(iv)           Limited capital supply across the risk-return spectrum,-(v)            Unclear and inconsistent regulations,-(vi)           Poor linkages between sustainable social enterprises, entrepreneurs, investors and innovation networks, and-(vii)          Poor and inconsistent impact measurement practice.[18]- -I would like to provide some illuminations on the experience from the SDGs Impact Investment Map across Africa. Deal flow in the impact investment market is significantly hindered by a limited number of viable investment options that can provide adequate financial returns as well as demonstrate social and environmental impacts. Particularly challenging is the low volume of potential impact investees that can demonstrate sufficient track record and capacity development to align with the risk appetite of investors.  Difficulties in sourcing viable impact investments also stem from inadequate measurement and reporting on social and environmental outcomes. Impact investors struggle to source funds and deals that meet their risk and return requirements. Institutional and other commercial investors find it particularly challenging to find funds and deals which can promise required market returns given the limited track record for many funds in Africa. Fund managers in turn have difficulties in sourcing enough deals that will fit investor requirements of both returns and risks. There are few conventional exit options for equity impact investments in Africa, which acts as a critical deterrent for investment in sustainable social enterprises on the continent and consequently hinders the supply of capital to impact investees.- -How can we turn these challenges into social entrepreneurship opportunities for includive development?-De-risking social entrepreneurship in Africa remains critical to providing support to about a quarter of entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa (over 64 million entrepreneurs),[19] achieving national development plans and the SDGs.- -First, there is an urgent need to improve the social enterprise policy space, including crafting regulations to drive corporate sustainability and scale corporate social investment as is emerging in South Africa and India[20]. Policy space can also take the form of tax exemptions and subsidies for social businesses, participation in public procurement (e.g. supply development programmes in Kenya),  tax relief for social enterprise investors, grant funding for social enterprises training and research, and accelerated social enterprise registration and accreditation.- -Second, to overcome the small-scale nature of most social enterprises that makes it harder to deploy capital to them, providing grants and catalytic capital to de-risk social entrepreneurship investments is needed to crowd-in private capital into social enterprise. This calls for strengthening the pipeline of viable impact investment prospects that can meet both the financial, social, and environmental objectives of impact investors.- -Third, fostering institutions for social enterprise capacity and practice. This includes institutionalizing social entrepreneurs in primary, secondary and tertiary levels curricula; addressing the skill deficits among youth; developing appropriate infrastructure for the impact investment sector (e.g. improving the ease of doing business); developing social enterprise intermediaries like incubators and accelerators; and enhancing impact measurement practice and standards.- -Fourth, facilitating the social enterprise ecosystem development approach (EDA) – a process that brings together all players to concentrate efforts on creating a vibrant environment for impact investing on the continent by addressing key barriers that inhibit their growth and development.[21]  The UNDP works in Lesotho, Senegal and Uganda and the British Council work in Ghana are good examples that could be scaled up. Through this EDA, UNDP is helping youth to develop capability, confidence and connectedness in solving their problems.- -Driving a Social Entrepreneurship Agenda for Africa is beyond what a development actor can achieve. It requires an ecosystem approach – with clear roles for governments, social enterprises and entrepreneurs, universities, and international organizations.- -For instance, governments can focus on ensuring policy space and standards for social enterprises including promoting ease of doing business environment, incentivising social enterprises and their incubators and accelerators. The universities have a role to play in providing evidence, efficiency and impact of social enterprises while sharing best practices and providing business support to social enterprises remain critical to international organizations. Social entrepreneurs also need to invest sufficient time in training, coaching, peer-to-peer learning, and mentorship.- -In conclusion,- -I would like to seek your indulgence to encourage all ministers, top government officials, private sector representatives, international organizations and participants in today’s event to serve as ambassadors of social enterprise agenda in Africa.- -UNDP, as the SDGs integrator in all countries, is ready to work with African countries to promote and advocate social entrepreneurship agenda on the continent.- -And with your permission, UNDP is ready to work with you to organize Africa’s Social Entrepreneurship Agenda at the Margins of the UN General Assembly in September 2022 in New York as a way of deepening advocacy on this very important issue.- - -Thank you-[1] https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/REO/AFR/2021/October/English/statisticalappendix.ashx

Food is usually front and centre during all the festivities and get-togethers with loved ones. Normally, one can easily waste up to 40% of the food that you buy, but during the festive season, our food wastage increases by an additional 25%. We end up wasting more food than what we buy.-With this in mind, WWF South Africa and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is calling on South Africans to be waste-wise this holiday season and think before we discard, use leftovers inspirationally and store food safely with an exciting campaign called “SAME TASTE. NO WASTE”.-“The easiest way to start reducing your food waste is to audit your food. When you start planning your meals intentionally and shop consciously, you will already notice that you buy less and so waste less,” says Pavitray Pillay, Behaviour Change Lead within the Business Development Unit at WWF South Africa.-“As individuals we can play a big part in limiting the triple negative impact of food waste. By decreasing the food wasted in our homes, we can contribute positively to responsible consumption and production, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing food security. This festive season (and beyond), celebrate a reduction in food waste and give the gift of contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals” shares Simone Smit, Head of Exploration at UNDP.- -South Africa already in a food crisis-It is estimated that food waste costs South Africa over R75 million per annum due to approximately 12,6 million tons of food waste being generated every year. With an estimated 80% of edible food thrown away, this situation is morally and ethically unsustainable, especially in our country where 2,5 million people experience hunger every day and in a country that has the highest child stunting statistic globally.-It is suggested that for every ton of edible surplus food, an estimated 4 000 nutritious meals could be made for those in need. In the period of September to December 2020, 9,34 million people in South Africa (16% of the total population) faced high levels of acute food insecurity. Currently, the key drivers for food insecurity are COVID-19, economic decline, unemployment, rising food prices and drought.- -Food waste’s effect on the environment is devastating-When food is wasted, the embedded nutrition, energy, water and capital, as well as other resources are also wasted. - -Placing the spotlight on the prevention of food waste-To create awareness of the food waste problem that we face in South Africa and to prove that we can all play a part in changing our behaviour and reducing our food waste footprint, WWF South Africa and UNDP invited local chefs Jocelyn Meyer Adams, Vusi Ndlovu and Jason Whitehead to lend a hand.-Using their expertise, the talented chefs were all challenged to create some mouth-watering dishes from food that was going to be discarded. A feast was produced, and the chefs delivered delectable dishes with fitting names such as ‘Almost tossed salad’, ‘Pasta the sell by date’, ‘Throw away canapés’, to name a few.-“All of these signature dishes demonstrated that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with the food that is all too often rejected. We are encouraging everyone to act as ‘food saving champions’ this holiday season and be smart when shopping for and preparing meals. Educate yourself about food; know where it comes from and the incredible journey it takes and value food more,” concludes Pillay.- -Food practices that are good for you and the planet-Keep an eye on WWF South Africa’s social media pages (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and website this festive season for important facts, fun and delicious recipes and tips on how to reduce your food waste footprint.- --Ends-- -Notes for Editors:-Here are some tips to prevent food waste at home this holiday season:- - ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03']","Simone Smit,Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,South Africa,Goal 2  Zero hunger,partnerships,Featured,Food security,Press release,UNDP,English"

Through this report, UNDP endeavours to carefully consider lessons learnt and share the implementation success stories in the findings from the three African countries who were early adopters of this transformative approach to creating business impact for people and the planet.-The virtual meeting convened several key players including Honourable Minister of Finance, Kingdom of Lesotho, Mr. Thabo Sofonea, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities of Uganda, Mrs. Doreen S. Katusiime, CEO of Africa Venture Philanthropic Association, Dr. Frank Aswani, UNDP Resident Representative South Africa and Director, AFSH, UNDP Country Office staff and other Regional Experts on the subject matter that were pivotal in the successful implementation of EDA in the Uganda, Senegal and Lesotho Country Offices.-The EDA comes as a timely toolkit to enable countries to deliver transformative post-COVID-19 recovery solutions. Evidence of its effectiveness shows that through the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, EDA enabled governments to initiate and deliver some of the strategic progress and policy reforms required across multiple ministries. It was noted that the approach enabled the creation of partnerships and facilitated the establishment of cross-sector integrated solutions that targeted the needs of stakeholders across the value chain.-A reflection and consensus amongst the discussants revolved around how EDA presents an innovative way through which countries could successfully engage the private sector to drive inclusive growth as it leverages collaboration and the co-creation among stakeholder interventions. This is facilitated through an Action Platform to address challenges in the business ecosystem that stifles opportunities and impact. Additionally, the Innovation Challenge Award directly supports business solutions/innovations and provides Catalytic Support to scale up and replicate innovation and business solutions with the direct participation of private sector companies and entrepreneurs.-The Honourable Minister of Finance, Kingdom of Lesotho, Mr. Thabo Sofonea dubbed this “a game-changer”.-UNDP’s field experience during implementation observed the following impact outcomes: Lesotho (Financial Inclusion through Mobile Money) improved financial inclusion through access to mobile money; Uganda (Tourism Development) developed a competitive tourism sector that benefits marginalized communities and informal businesses; Senegal (Access to Solar Energy) aims to improve access to solar energy services for low-income populations through the creation of a supportive ecosystem for inclusive businesses in the solar energy sector.-Dr. Ayodele Adusola, UNDP Resident Representative South Africa and Director of the Africa Finance Sector Hub, emphasized that tackling post-COVID-19 socio-economic recovery requires a coalition of stakeholders in order to improve conditions for the private sector to contribute to better healthcare systems, create jobs, and support SMEs. “The collaborative nature of the EDA will allow various stakeholders to join forces against climate change through interventions such as regenerative agriculture, clean transport, or clean energy and managing the transition to carbon-neutral solutions. If we are to achieve inclusive and transformative impact required to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the EDA creates an enabling environment for this. UNDP stands ready to partner and replicate our success in other countries, with other impact opportunities. When we all share in the vision and action for a better future for people and the planet, we can tackle complex development challenges.” he noted.- -The findings of the report prove the effectiveness of the EDA in relation to the following aspects:-·       Local ownership. The approach leverages the collective intelligence, resources, and capabilities of ecosystem members and aligns their strategies for solving challenges.-·       Transformation. The approach strikes at the root causes of development challenges and builds local capacity to tackle them. Innovation Challenges enable entrepreneurs to develop and test concrete business solutions, generating tangible impact quickly.-·       Sustainability. The approach creates the structures for local actors to continue to solve their own challenges collectively and continuously improve the business enabling environment.-·       Track record. The approach has a track record of success. In Lesotho, Senegal, and Uganda, Inclusive Business Ecosystem Initiatives have triggered policy changes including tax reforms, improved quality standards, trained workers, and helped develop and scale business model innovations and financing mechanisms.-Full recording of the launch: Link to Recording-Passcode: !!*xYop4-Download the study here: https://bit.ly/3D16tBh

Access to quality education remains one the key challenges threatening Africa’s development in the era of rapid technological advancement. This especially applies for girls, who are significantly underrepresented in STEM related fields. Only 28% of science researchers are women in Africa, while 72% of men occupy STEM landscape.- -The UN Development Programme (UNDP) in South Africa, in partnership with an array of organisations - FEMSTEM (Pty) Ltd (FEMSTEM), Sci-bono Discovery Centre in Johannesburg (Sci-Bono in short), and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) – therefore launched the ‘Think Big Start Small: Youth-led Robotics for Multi-dimensional Climate Solutions’ (‘Youth in Climate Robotics’ in short) pilot project to equip educators and high-school learners across South Africa with skills in STEM fields, including robotics and coding. Supported by the Embassy of Denmark in South Africa, the project is one of several UNDP initiatives towards a youth-driven digital and sustainable development in South Africa, especially in the area of climate change.- -The pilot project was designed to target both the need for skills development in the digital economy as well as the need for increased environmental awareness, and the application of digital skills to solve energy (SDG 7), climate (SDG 13) end environment (SDG 15) related challenges.- -Over a six months period, a series of Climate, Space and Robotics training workshops - delivered by the Director of FEMSTEM, Judi Sandrock, and her team  - a cohort of 25 educators and more than 150 students have been trained, both online and in-person in those areas where students do not have access to devices and internet for online learning. The beneficiaries come from eight different provinces and more than 50% are women and girls. The educators and learners took part of this project in their private capacity and all activities took place on evenings and weekends to not interfere with weekday classes.- -“The Youth in Climate Robotics project forms part UNDP’s greater commitment to youth empowerment and sustainable development, particularly SDG 7, 13 and 15. It is the hope that involved educators and learners, equipped with new skills and inspiration, will go on to lead a generation of climate conscious South African youth who are committed to the mission of mitigating the negative impacts of climate and environmental changes, serving their communities at both a local and national level. The project is also an example of UNDP’s active engagement with the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation and adaptation – aiming to generate action, at international, national and local level toward a sustainable world.” – Dr Ayodele Odusola, Resident Representative, UNDP South Africa.- -As South Africa is on its journey to shape and enable a 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) and harness the full potential of the digital economy, capacitating young people with the necessary skills is driving South Africa closer to taking full advantage of the endless opportunities that the digital economy offers. It is increasingly recognised that Internet of Things, Blockchain, Virtual Reality, artificial intelligence, big data, smart technology, the list can go on – components of what is called the 4IR – are the future and that the digital revolution has great potential to do good for more people, both better and faster.- -As the UN SDGs integrator, UNDP has a global digital strategy — the first of its kind in the UN system —that charts a course to leverage digital innovation both inside the organization and in service lines to countries around the world. Digitalisation is also one of the three enablers identified in the new UNDP Strategic Plan 2022-2025, where UNDP is committed to support countries to build inclusive, ethical and sustainable digital societies.- -The digital revolution also has the potential to catalyse a green and sustainable economy. As the world is facing the great challenge of climate change, threatening the prosperity of the planet and future generations, it is important that youth are not only educated about climate change, but are also empowered to become future climate problem-solvers.- -The project has been enabled by support from the Embassy of Denmark in South Africa, as well as UNICEF in South Africa, two partners that are passionate youth-led climate action.- -“Denmark is committed to contribute to empowering South African women and youth and to support innovative and sustainable development in South Africa. Digital skills are one of the most important assets of today, and certainly also the future. Our hope is that the effects of this project will multiply and steadily grow as educators train more students and learners can put their skills into practice over the coming years”, H.E. Tobias Elling Rehfeld, Danish Ambassador to South Africa.- -“Young people are leading the way in climate action. ​An urgent and collective response, with children and young people at the center, can still prevent the impact of climate change from becoming even worse.” - Christine Muhigana, Representative, UNICEF South Africa.- -Despite the challenges faced at the height of the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, meaning that most project activities had to be conducted virtually, beneficiaries have been able to pursue practical experiments concerning solar energy, greenhouse gases and data monitoring related to natural resources through XinaBox xChips kits that were sent to their home. FEMSTEM is an award-winning company and the implementer of the globally recognized XinaBox STEM programme in South Africa, offering virtual workshops and space camps for learners and accredited facilitator trainings.-Apart from technical and interactive workshops, educators and learners have been able to participate in inspirational and technical guest lectures. One was organised by the project partner Sci-Bono - a nationally and globally recognised science centre that offers world-class learning experiences in math, science and technology. The Science Talk was themed ‘Our next great challenge: youth in energy and climate change’ and featured three young professionals in the climate and energy space that shared their knowledge and experiences with young learners interested in pursuing a future career in the intersection between technology and environmental sustainability.- -Educator Colleen Urquhart, a community STEM facilitator under the project in rural Northern Cape shares about the importance STEM education, especially for rural kids who often left behind. “Access to Science and Technology enables our learners to gain a place at the table when it comes to new and exciting careers that are emerging as a result of the 4IR. Early exposure to these skills gives our learners the confidence to compete with other learners who come from more privileged backgrounds. My role is to inspire, encourage and equip interested learners with what they may need to make this possible.”- -Promotion of youth climate & robotics champions-In addition to contributing to increased capacity in digital skills and technological opportunities, the project aimed to develop local and youth-led climate solutions as well to promote and celebrate youth climate champions emerging from the project. At the end of the training programme, learners were challenged to submit innovative robotics ideas aimed at solving problems related the targeted SDGs – 7, 13 and 15. A wide range of ideas emerged such as protection of solar panels, reduction of over-fertilization of crops and soil moisture warning using smart technology. Then a final award ceremony was held at Sci-Bono Discovery Centre on the 9th of October 2021, where all participating learners and educators were graduated and awards presented to five exceptional learners and two dedicated educators:- -·       Most Innovative Robotics Projects:-o   SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy: learner Grace Pakuda-o   SDG 13 – Climate Action: learner Nandi Zuma-o   SDG 15 – Life on Land: learner Tahirah Ahmed -·       Project Team Player: learner Shiven Phlad-·       Best Overall Performance: learner Tafara Mutero-·       Project Ambassador: learner Grace Pakuda-·       Most Learners Engaged: educators Colleen Urquhart and Denise Schemel- -I applied to participate in the project because I am passionate about STEM as I know that STEM skills are needed for success across a variety of tasks and disciplines. I want to gain as much knowledge as I can and develop as many skills as I can because I am eager to use my knowledge and skills to find solutions to different issues in environment. Especially climate change regarding which is a vital issue that is threatening us all. – Grace Pakuda, learner and Youth in Clinate Robotics participant. -Although only a few learners and educators could be recognised at the Award Ceremony, the impact of the project is far greater. This unique pilot project tackling youth skills, climate change and digital revolution has contributed to developing capacity and confidence in digital skills and technological ideas to the next generation of climate influencers and climate problem solvers, which has enabled their preparedness for further higher education, training or entrepreneurship opportunities for future green economy markets.- -The participating educators and learners have with passion absorbed new knowledge in areas of the 4IR and sustainable development. They have also shared and developed new ideas and strategies that will contribute not only to taking themselves to the next steps in their careers, but also to the design of future projects of this kind. The key take-away from this project truly is Think Big, Start Small. As the UNDP we hope that this first of its kind pilot project is only the beginning and that the approach can be further be developed together with partners in South Africa to continue to empower South African youth in STEM fields and sustainable development.-Written by: Tove Nordberg and Ntokozo Mahlangu","['Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Event,Climate change,South Africa,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 13  Climate action,Featured,partnerships,UNDP Donor Partners,News,UNDP,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,English"

At a high-level side event on the margins of the 76th United Nations General Assembly, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, Africa Investor, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) presented the new and innovative Regulation as a Stimulus economic model and urged African governments to support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through intentional regulatory reforms that remove trade bottlenecks so as to enhance the continent’s socioeconomic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.-Through interviews with industry stakeholders, documentary research, econometric analysis, policy mapping and surveys, Regulations as a Stimulus (RaaS), developed by UNDP and Africa Investor, with support from the AfCFTA Secretariat and a research partnership with Cariolis Technologies, identifies regulatory levers that can be utilized by African Heads of State to quickly create change, offsetting some of the short-term adjustment costs and relieving firms from higher export costs.-Eminent panelists, including African Union's AfCFTA Champion - former President of Niger - Issoufou Mahamadou; Secretary-General of the AfCFTA Secretariat Wamkele Mene; Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Executive Secretary Pauline Mbala Elago; Trade and Development Bank President and CEO Tadesse Admassu; World Customs Organization Secretary-General Kunio Mikuriya; and FCI CEO Peter Mulroy; welcomed the timely focus of the Regulation as a Stimulus (RaaS) approach.-""The Regulation as a Stimulus initiative gives African Heads of State a credible and practical stimulus solution and post COVID-19 recovery tool,"" said AfCFTA Champion and former President of Niger H.E. Issoufou Mahamadou, in his Goodwill Message. ""It is an accelerator that will speed up implementation of the AfCFTA and aims at mobilizing African Leaders towards bold and impactful action in the spheres of trade facilitation and regional integration.""-“The model's capacity to put money directly into the hands of people by reducing costs linked to meeting export trade requirements, increases the capabilities of individuals to maintain incomes and employment through savings in better trade environments, while paying attention to women specific concerns” explained United Nations Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Assistant Administrator and Regional Bureau for Africa Director, Ahunna Eziakonwa, co-convener of the event. “Regulation as a Stimulus is a unique and timely model for African governments to create policy and structural enablers that will aid the revival and transformation of economies post-COVID-19.”-According to the World Bank, the COVID-19 crisis has brought Sub-Saharan Africa to its first economic recession in 25 years - disrupting SME supply chains and adversely affecting the informal economy, on which 90 per cent of people depend for livelihoods. The socio-economic fallout has been brutal - as over 30 million people are pushed back into poverty.-The model illustrates that Africa could add $500 billion to business revenue, and create over 260,000 more jobs by 2025 - if transformative action is taken in five key areas: access to finance, business environment, infrastructure, before the border charges (export, import documents and procedures) and at the border costs. RaaS will facilitate inclusion and tackle inequality, since sectors where women are predominant, such as food, soft commodities, and textiles are projected for an 18 per cent uplift.
-“The RaaS research shows how streamlining regulation can support implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement and potentially create savings for businesses on costs, generate stimulus, and support governments in creating favorable market conditions,” stressed Wamkele Mene, Secretary-General of the AfCFTA Secretariat. “Frameworks and support structures that enhance cross-border trade and reduce costs create platforms for ease of movement of professionals, enabling labor mobility across the region.”-Enhancing trade facilitation reforms is a priority in Africa's Regional Economic Communities (REC), as emphasized by Pauline Elago, Executive Secretary of SACU - and RaaS adds new impetus that can take those initiatives further, and faster.-Representatives of the private sector, like Dr. Tadesse Admassu of the Trade and Development Bank, and Peter Mulroy of FCI, and from multilateral institutions like World Customs Organization's Kunio Mikuriya, who also spoke at the event, lauded the initiative for its innovative approach, pledging support to its implementation.-“Through the RaaS model, African governments, supported by the private sector, can generate enabling environments, using frameworks such as digitization, standardization and legislation that support the sustainable growth of trade and trade-related infrastructure investment across the continent,” emphasized Hubert Danso, Chief Executive Officer of the institutional investment holding platform Africa Investor. “Financial regulatory frameworks such as regional agreements can widen access to innovative financing and enable cross-border financial flows. At the same time, national-level regulations could harness accountancy systems and self-assessment, increasing intra-African trade by US$35.8 billion by 2025 with an estimated annual growth of 14 per cent.”-The model will be taken on a roadshow across African countries - by the partnering Institutions - and continued advocacy will be made at key convenings - like AU and REC Summits.-Watch the full event: https://youtu.be/Tye1lCG_UQM-For further information and interview requests, please contact:-Addis Ababa: Ngele Ali, Regional Communications Advisor, UNDP, ngele.ali@undp.org, +251 97 656 9921-Pretoria: Bobby Shabangu, Knowledge Management, Africa Finance Sector Hub, UNDP bobby.shabangu@undp.org, +27720679593-New York: Eve Sabbagh, Strategic Communications Specialist, UNDP, eve.sabbagh@undp.org,

In the context of youth – education, employment and environment – are three of the fifteen fields of action that are considered priority areas by the UN and the international community. While youth empowerment is a global endeavour, the challenges faced by youth in South Africa prevail. As identified by the South African Government, there are several ongoing challenges relating to youth that need immediate action to unleash the full potential of youth in achieving prosperity. These challenges include access to quality of education, job creation, and livelihood opportunities, that are hindering the contribution of youth  in shaping a thriving and sustainable future for South Africa.- -The observation of the UN International Youth Day on 12 August encourages the acknowledgment of the aforementioned issues and the creation of potential solutions. The UNDP maintains an active involvement in devising opportunities for the youth that not only empower them with skills and employment, but also achieves the concurrent goal of promoting an environmentally sustainable economy for the nation too. This year’s international Youth Day is celebrated under the theme “Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health”, as such underpinning the criticality of meaningful participation of young people in climate action, environmental governance and in the economy.- -UNDP and its partners have been supporting the Government of South Africa through empowerment initiatives that create new opportunities to address the triple challenge of poverty, income inequality, and unemployment. These interventions promote better governance, inclusive growth, energy access, climate resilience, and sustainable development. Some examples are the recent collaboration with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) aimed to intensify efforts to reduce youth unemployment, the Technical Vocational Education and Training project to upskill youth with skills relevant to the automotive industry, the and implementation of a Digital Climate, Robotics and STEM project for high-school learners aimed at addressing issues related to climate-related Sustainable Development Goals. Below is an example of an UNDP-led youth intervention in a green sector, namely in the wind energy sector.- -The future of wind energy – experiences from young wind energy technicians-The South African Wind Energy Programme (SAWEP) Phase two is a UNDP-supported multi-year technical assistance project promoting the large-scale commercialisation of wind energy, implemented by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) in close collaboration with the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) and a range of other partners.   Since its inception in 2016 the project has supported policy development and implementation, as well as real impact on the ground in the space of wind energy development in the country.- -The South Africa energy sector largely constitutes of fossil fuels (mainly coal) which has led to country being top 14 greenhouse gas emitter in the world,  and the country is also faced by capacity and supply constraints (mitigated by the so-called load shedding). Even if South Africa has amongst the highest rate of energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa, 9% of the population still remain without access reliable, affordable and sustainable energy – a gap which the SDG 7 goal aims to close by 2030. South Africa is a prime country for renewable energy, especially from solar and wind resources. At the same time, the coal sector employs a large number of people. Therefore, a transition to a low-carbon society with increased use of renewable energy must be just and inclusive, with employment and training opportunities at the core of any strategy, which is recognised by the UNDP and embedded in South Africa’s development priorities. It is therefore key to support education, training and skilling opportunities in renewable energy, a mission which UNDP and its partners have been championing under SAWEP.- -In empowering youth in the green economy in South Africa – in the wind energy sector - UNDP has  teamed up with the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC), a specialised wind training facility under the Department of Higher Education & Training (DHET), residing at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). This support has led to a first cohort of internationally accredited Wind Turbine Energy Technicians (WTST) consisting of 24 young graduates (40% women) from around the country successfully trained through a seven-months accredited programme and absorbed by the South African wind energy market. The WTST qualification is a globally sought-after skill which trains a highly specialised technician to be able to work on a wind turbine undertaking construction, commissioning, maintenance, service, fault-finding and repairs.- -“This support has definitely made a long-term impact in South Africa in terms of the delivery of much needed local technicians for employment in the South African Wind industry as well as the empowerment of individuals to make them marketable for employment and thus contributing towards the ongoing fight against unemployment. The biggest impact is arguably the contribution to reduce South Africa’s ongoing energy constraints as well as combatting Global Warming, said Henk Volschenk, SARETEC Training Supervisor.”- -We interviewed three of the fantastic wind energy technicians, to learn more about their views of the wind technician field and wind energy sector:- -What made you choose to become a wind technician, and what is the best thing about being a wind technician?-“When I visited a wind farm in Molteno, I had an interest in the challenges wind technician face, challenges of working at 100 feet in the air, facing not only electrical challenges but also mechanical, hydraulics and computer skills. As someone who likes challenging herself those challenges appeared joyful to me.“ - Pumeza Tshomela-“At first I was having little information but I wanted to be a part of a big change in energy producing, when I started the training I knew this is where I want to be, the best thing is I am proudly to be one of the female wind technicians.” - Bongiwe Mthethwa-What do you think about the future for renewable energy in South Africa?-“The future is very bright, renewable produce clean energy which is good for environment and it is a solution for energy that is needed in our daily bases.” - Bongiwe Mthethwa-“The future of renewable energy in South Africa is yet to grow and become the most valued source of energy and provide an income in many households.” - Pumeza Tshomela-What advice would you give to other young people that would like to work in the sustainable energy space?-“Work hard and if you planning to go into the wind industry you won't go wrong because it's the future.” - Azra Witbooi-“Sustainable energy is growing fast in our country, if you are a person that's not afraid of heights, challenges and have interest in technical skills this is a career for you.” - Pumeza Tshomela-With more countries, companies, organisations and households turning to renewable energy options as a way to both ensure a reliable and affordable energy supply, and to adhere to necessary climate mitigation action, there is no doubt that the future of wind energy is bright. The Wind Atlas for South Africa (WASA), developed under SAWEP has helped the identification of Renewable Energy Development Zones in South Africa, which in turn supports the implementation of the Integrated Resource Plan 2019 which plans for at least 14.4 GW of new wind and 6 GW of new solar PV capacity by 2030 for South Africa to meet national and international climate targets and net-zero emissions by 2050 as per South Africa’s Low-Emissions Development Strategy.-It is estimated that South Africa will have to train around 1,700 wind technicians over the next years to meet the increasing demand for workers as per South Africa’s current commitments to renewable energy. As the UNDP we are proud to have been working with a great institution like SARETEC under SAWEP, which makes it possible for young aspiring South African’s to create a long-lasting career in a bright green sector, and to share this experience with their families, communities and peers. Institutions like SARETEC are also key in supplying the increasing need of wind energy technicians, and thereby enabling the transition to a sustainable and climate resilient future. Not only in South Africa, but with the opportunity to share knowledge to the continent and the Global South. -Article written by Tove Nordberg and Char Deslandes, UNDP","['Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Blog post,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,partnerships,Success Stories,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,South Africa,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 13  Climate action,Press release,Topics,English"

The MoU is signed together with a project document titled “Automotive Training and Re-Skilling in the Post-COVID-19 Economic Recovery for Vulnerable Youth and Women in South Africa”, which is a year-long project focused on capacitating TVET vocational training in the automotive industry, funded by the Government of Japan. The project seeks to improve the provision of automotive skills through a partnership with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and to strengthen the capacity of the selected TVET colleges to align with the post-COVID-19 economy and labour market needs, including through flexible and digital learning mechanisms.- -TVET institutions have and continue to play a crucial role in providing vocational training to women and youth, as well as supplying the demand for semi-skilled workers in various industries. The automotive sector employs workers across various skills levels and is central to re-industrialising the South African economy post-COVID-19. It for this reason that the project will support three TVET colleges namely Coastal KZN College (Kwazulu-Natal), Northlink College (Western Cape), and Tshwane South College (Gauteng).-                                                   -Project activities include a rapid needs assessment that will uncover the key challenges and opportunities faced by the TVET colleges and students in the COVID-19 context, the strengthening of the institutional capacity of the beneficiary TVET colleges through the provision of upgraded equipment, capacity building of TVET youth and graduates for skills to gain employment, and the establishment of an engagement platform between TVET youth and job opportunities in the automotive sector.  -                  -“We have always looked at training our students for employability and the skills that they acquire in our TVET colleges should help them easily get employment or be able to create employment themselves through the artisanal and technical skills we offer. We have since received compelling support from Japan through financial resources to ensure that the technical capacity of our TVET colleges is aligned with the industry requirements and private sector needs broadly,” said DHET Minister Dr Blade Nzimande.- -COVID-19 has deepened development challenges that nations were already struggling to address. The youth unemployment rate in South Africa is at a concerning state (exacerbated by COVID-19), and the pandemic has also forced some learning institutions to suspend their offerings or pursue remote learning. Intensive responses are needed; that not only driven by government, but also the private sector and development partners, to accelerate development, transformation, and resilience.- -“UNDP has prioritised the education sector as a key lever to achieving equal opportunities for all South Africans and ensuring that no one left behind. However, COVID-19 has greatly disrupted the provision of education. UNDP programming tackles the very core of the challenge - access and education infrastructure – through promoting development cooperation, building collaborative networks, and driving innovation,” said Dr Ayodele Odusola, Resident Representative of the UNDP South Africa.- -This project will consolidate the existing interventions and government plans to support youth, women, and vocational training by providing skills to enhance employability and increase linkages with the private sector, particularly the automotive sector. Although it will run over a period of one year, UNDP and its partners have designed the project with special focus on engaging key role players to secure additional resources and ensure sustainability. UNDP has also been working closely with key actors in the automotive industry such as the National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers (NAACAM) and Toyota. It has also made linkages with existing national interventions such as the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention by working with the SA Youth Mobi platform implemented by the Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator.- -“Japan is committed to the skills development in South Africa and this project is closely aligned with the broader interests of the Japan-South Africa collaboration. Additionally, the project is aiming concretize the implementation of the commitment of TICAD (Tokyo International Conference on African Development) co-organized by Japan and UNDP. The project builds up on already existing interventions we have in the country in relation to technical education and vocational training. We envision that the partnership contributes towards the business exchanges between South African and Japanese industries to achieve greater employment opportunities for youth and women in SA. The project, in alignment with the Toyota Manufacturing School, is gaining traction among the international business environment improvement program organized by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan,” said His Excellency Mr. Maruyama Norio, Ambassador of Japan to the Republic of South Africa.- -The project is one of several COVID-19 response interventions that UNDP has been championing alongside the South African government to support the country to recover from the devastating impacts of the pandemic. Ongoing projects include the joint initiative with the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) in empowering Small Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs), and a youth employment and enterprise development programme in partnership with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) to intensify efforts to reduce youth unemployment.- -JOINTLY ISSUED BY UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (UNDP) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION & TRAINING (DHET), AND THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN.- -For more information, or media interviews please contact:-Ntokozo Mahlangu – Communications Analyst, UNDP: 060 533 6760 (Cell) ntokozo.mahlangu@undp.org (Email)- ","['Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 4  Quality education,Inclusive growth,South Africa,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,UNDP Donor Partners,Press release,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,English"

Construction will begin shortly and is estimated to take two to three weeks.-Funded by the Government of Sudan and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with support from UNDP, the turbine will demonstrate the viability of utility-scale wind energy in Africa’s third largest nation, and is expected to provide power to 14,000 people, connecting to the national grid.-The project will be used as a showcase for future windfarms across Sudan, in support of the Government’s efforts to attract renewable energy investment. It aims to capitalize on the nation’s significant wind-energy potential to improve access to energy, diversify Sudan's power sources, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.-“The arrival of our first wind turbine marks the first step in Sudan’s wind power journey and continues the significant advances in renewable energy we have made over the past decade,” said Yasir Abdalla Saied, Director General, Directorate of Renewable Energy, Ministry of Energy and Petroleum.-During the journey via Port Sudan to the windfarm site in Dongola, Northern State, the Netherlands-made turbine crossed 4,600 km and took seven vehicles to transport, finishing a 19-day journey from the Netherlands to Port Sudan.-“60% of Sudan’s population lack regular access to energy,” says UNDP’s Resident Representative Yuri Afanasiev. “This exciting update is progress towards new solutions that help move the dial on access to affordable energy, improving health, education, the lives of women, and economic opportunities. Having supported Sudan with training, policy advice and research in this field for some time, the turbine’s arrival is a symbolic milestone we are thrilled to see.”-The turbine will also provide training and opportunities to equip engineers with skills to support future wind projects.-UNDP’s support for this initiative is part of its efforts to increase access to renewable energy in Sudan, creating opportunities for employment, improved basic services, and strengthening resilience to climate change.-

This will be complemented by assistance for nearby communities and businesses, national policies, and wildlife and park administration.-“This project will provide Sudan with opportunities to go into more development in all communities, to ensure biodiversity and protect natural resources,” said H.E. Dr. Amin Saleh Yassin, Undersecretary of Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning. “We thank all partners for contributing and moving forward towards sustainable development.”-Sudan’s rich natural environment is impacted by the lack of strong protected areas, both at a policy level and operationally, and limited livelihood options for those living nearby. Project initiatives will enhance key sites, addressing environmental degradation and creating economic opportunities.-Within the parks, biodiversity will be supported via a range of targeted activities, including: consultative demarcation of park boundaries and buffer zones with communities; rehabilitation of selected wetland sites, mangroves and other areas; creation of wildlife corridors; efforts to address invasive species; and expanded monitoring of protected areas. Complementing this will be upgrades to park equipment and facilities.-Efforts to develop economic opportunities will include ecotourism – establishing tourism infrastructure and working with operators on eco-friendly activities – and expanding livelihood opportunities for the 62 communities inside and adjacent to the parks.-“This project and other interventions linked to it emphasise sustainable livelihoods and the ability of people to earn a living from the land in a sustainable way, while protecting Sudan’s natural resources,” said Yuri Afanasiev, UNDP Resident Representative in Sudan. “We hope this will contribute to the Government’s additional efforts supporting recovery in Sudan.”-At a national level, assistance will include training with international experts for national conservation and environmental agency staff, and financial support to meet international UNESCO-conservation guidelines, improve management of the national parks system, and develop a parks tourism strategy and other national policies.-Highlighting the expected impact, Prof.  Rashid Meky, Secretary-General of HCENR, said: “This is a long journey starting today as we take the first steps in this five-year programme. We look forward to increasing the collaboration we have always enjoyed with UNDP and partners - this is an important opportunity for the Government and the people of Sudan.”-The project involves contributions from a range of agencies and partners, including: the Ministry of Finance and National Economy, HCENR, GEF, UNDP, the Wildlife Conservation General Administration, the Range and Pasture General Directorate (RPGD), the Agriculture Research Corporation (ARC), the Sudanese Development Initiative (SUDIA), the Wildlife Research Centre, the Sudanese Environment Conservation Society (SECS), and UNESCO.-### ### ###-For further information, contact:-William Seal-Head of Communications

In the last quarter of 2021, the UN SDG Joint Programme Component 1 has  completed its first and very important phase, the Diagnostic Phase, which involves desk research, stakeholder interviews, surveys and gap analysis conducted by four Participating United Nations Organizations (PUNOs) across priority sectors: Banking and  Finance, Forestry, Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) and Gender which allows an overview of the performance of sectors, the design of capacity building activities and development of a green agreement with stakeholders.-The Sustainable Development Goals  Programme Component 1 was launched in October 2020, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation and is implemented by four PUNOs: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations  Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with the Surinamese government through the Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment. - -Forestry and Gold Mining Sectors-The forest sector diagnostic done by FAO revealed new market opportunities, including the scaling up of revenues of ecotourism and ecosystem services in Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) value chains that could generate twice as much income. With regard to Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM), UNDP’s analysis revealed key insights including the limited access to finance and investments and the sector’s risks to sustainable development due to occupational and social impacts. ASGM operations are currently incentivized through collaborative payments between individual miners and concession title holders. Some concessions include titled areas that indigenous or/and maroons consider their traditional homelands and/or to which they claim customary rights.-The findings of all four priority sectors are consolidated in one comprehensive draft Gap Analysis Synthesis Report of the UN Joint SDG Fund Programme which includes recommendations and facilitates the next phase of the project.-Phases UN SDG Joint Fund Programme Component 1 -Currently, the UN SDG Joint Fund Programme Component 1 project is in the second phase, which includes capacity building- and engagement activities as well as the establishment of a network for dialogue among stakeholders. In the last quarter of 2021 the first sensitization workshop with stakeholders from the public, private and financial sectors, civil society, and academia was conducted. The workshop focused on sustainable finance, gender-sensitive approaches, and its role in the Suriname Recovery Plan 2020-2022, including the barriers and opportunities for sustainable project finance and capacity needs. -In the first quarter of 2022, the Environmental and Social Risk Analysis training leaded by UNEP was conducted for stakeholders in Banking and Finance Sector. Currently stakeholders from Government, Civil society, Banking and Finance, Private Sector and Youth are following a Gender Capacity Strengthening Course leaded by the UNFPA with the aim to strengthen capacity of relevant institutions to ultimately re-orient the flow of expected resources toward more inclusive and gender responsive sustainable actions.-The third phase is also in preparation.

The target groups were represented by their umbrella organizations namely Vereniging Inheemse Dorpshoofden in Suriname (Association of Indigenous Village Leaders, VIDS), and Samenwerkingsverband van Tribale volken in Suriname (Collaboration of Tribal Peoples in Suriname consisting of the Kwinti, Aluku, Matawai, Paamaka, Okanisi and Saamaka, KAMPOS). The JP is aimed at developing integrated policy solutions to enable inclusion, build resilience, and improve livelihoods among Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (ITPs) in Suriname, in an effort to Leave No One Behind in the 2030 Agenda. The JP aims to strengthen policy and regulatory framework to improve inclusion and resilience of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (ITPs); improved coverage of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (W.A.S.H.); and improve livelihood, enhanced food security, and establishment of female farmer networks in targeted ITPs communities.-Ambassador Miriam Mac Intosh, Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Business and International Cooperation, underlined the relevance of the JP. She confirmed that the elements of the JP are in line with the social agenda of the government and also taking into account the Multi-Annual Development Plan and Reform Plan 2020-2022. The JP will contribute to the country’s implementation of the UN MSDCF and the development of the interior. As Suriname is conducting the voluntary review and will be reporting for the first time on the SDGs at the High Political Forum in July 2020, the JP will contribute to the commitment that No One is Left Behind. Ambassador Mac Intosh recognised the strong support received from the UN and its agencies and look forward to continued collaboration with the UN and other relevant stakeholders in the sprint of 2030 and to ensure that No One is left Behind.-Captain Robertho Joghie, village chief of the Konomerume (Donderskamp) and board member of VIDS, thought it was a special day and appreciate the involvement of VIDS in formulating the JP proposal. He memorated that in 2020, a digital survey was conducted by UNDP in collaboration with VIDS on the impact of COVID-19 among Indigenous Households and several project interventions took place after including the face mask production training. VIDS also has very good contact with UNDP and FPIC is applied in every project and information is exchanged on both sides. He underlined the importance of water supply, especially with the COVID-19, to wash hands regularly, but also for safe drinking water which is not available in all villages. Food security is also important especially at certain times such as during flooding. In line with the slogan of Leave No One Behind, the energy issue is also important, especially to safeguard food security.-Captain Samuel Petrusi, village chief and board member of KAMPOS, made his remarks in Sranan Tongo from his plot in the Interior, underlined the relevance of the JP. He had in his hand a mouth mask, and he wanted to highlight the benefit of the training for the production of face mask. He was also appreciative of the collaboration with UNDP and highlighted the experiences of the Tribal communities during the implementation of the UNDP’s project on Mitigating the Impact of COVID-19 among Indigenous and Tribal Communities. He was happy with the approach of UNDP, VIDS and KAMPOS, how to bring development, and indicated that more needed to be done. KAMPOS represents various communities and only in his region there are 60 villages. More communication and the awareness are needed related to handwashing and its purpose. Captain Petrusi also underlined the importance of involvement of the communities and communication through open dialogue. He also pointed out that water provision is very important, and noted that with the flood water sources, including the rivers, are polluted. He seized the opportunity to say thanks and closed his remarks by expressing his agreement that UNDP is not only communicating with the government but also with the communities.-Ms. Isiuwa Iyahen of UN Women, emphasized that the JP will directly benefit ITPs and their communities, as it will “accelerate SDGs as it addresses poverty and hunger, equity, inclusion, and resilience by reducing the economic and services gaps between ITPs and the rest of Surinamese, as the interior is lagging behind in development compared to Paramaribo and the peripheral districts, mainly caused by a shortage of basic care facilities and adequate infrastructure, and that COVID-19 has further exasperated this predicament.-Through the JP UN Women reaffirms its dedication to the most vulnerable indigenous and tribal peoples, such as indigenous women, who should have prioritized access to social services and benefits, access to opportunities, livelihood, financing, and even continuing education.-In her closing remarks, Ms. Margaret Jones Williams, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, acknowledged the remarks from Amb. Miriam MacIntosh of BIBIS, on the relevance and importance of the JP to Suriname and to the Voluntary National Review to be presented. Ms. Jones Williams underscored that the inputs from Capitan Joghie and Capitan for Petrusi on behalf of VIDS and KAMPOS had allowed the audience to hear directly from the beneficiaries on the relevance of the JP to their-lives, livelihoods and recovery from the pandemic. She thanked all the participants for their participation, but also for the inputs over several months, as the launch event is the culmination of several months of data gathering, consultative meetings and project preparation, and looked forward to continued collaboration and partnership.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 04', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 11', 'Icon of SDG 16', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 5  Gender equality,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,Goals in action,Goal 4  Quality education,In the news,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities,Suriname,UN Agencies,For the record,English,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals"

As the country enters its 12th year of crisis, humanitarian needs are at their highest levels. A deteriorating socio-economic context has contributed to approximately 90% of the population living in poverty. Food insecurity has reached historic highs with an estimated 60% of the population who are food insecure. -In these critical circumstances, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with other humanitarian partners, is ramping up efforts to address food insecurity at a scale commensurate with current needs. It is doing so within the framework of the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the Parameters and Principles of UN Assistance in Syria to meet the needs of the most vulnerable across the country, including undernourished women, children and persons with disabilities. More impactful solutions to meet the food security needs of poor Syrians, irrespective of lines of control, can no longer be deferred.-As in other countries in the region, public bakeries represent a lifeline for millions of vulnerable Syrian households. The 12.4 million Syrians, who today are food insecure, depend on bread from public bakeries to meet their minimum daily calorie intake. Given the centrality of public bakeries to assure the nutrition of the poorest households, UNDP and partners are implementing a series of integrated humanitarian interventions within the framework of the HRP to strengthen the wheat-to-bread value chain, which has been greatly disrupted by years of conflict and drought.-On-going interventions include livelihoods support to farming communities and the rehabilitation of irrigation systems and public bakeries across the country. It also includes the rehabilitation of the only, still operating, public yeast factory in Syria, located in Homs Governorate. Before the crisis, Syria had four state-owned factories which daily provided around 113 tonnes of yeast to an extensive network of public bakeries throughout the country. Today, as a result of damage or destruction, the Homs factory is the only one that remains operational, albeit at a much-reduced scale. Only 6 to 10 tonnes of yeast (representing 5 to 9% of pre-crisis production) are produced daily and distributed to public bakeries in Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Tartous and Lattakia governorates. There are no major, private producers of yeast in the country. As a result, yeast needs to be imported, which, given the acute devaluation of the Syrian pound, greatly drives up bread prices at a time when vulnerable households are only able to cover 50 per cent of their basic expenditures. -Increasing yeast production at the Homs factory therefore represents a high-impact intervention to rapidly and significantly scale up access to affordable bread to vulnerable people in the above-cited governorates. Together, these governorates contain roughly one third of the food insecure population targeted by the whole of Syria humanitarian response. By the time rehabilitation is complete, the factory is expected to produce 24 tonnes of yeast per day, to be distributed to public bakeries in these areas. This increase will benefit an additional 3 million vulnerable people who will be able to access affordable bread.-The on-going rehabilitation of the Homs yeast factory, which is based on UNDP technical assessments, will cost approximately USD 1 million. In response to recent media reports, UNDP confirms that 80% of the funds will go to the technical rehabilitation of yeast processing and packaging equipment. The remaining 20% of the budget will go towards ensuring that the factory meets basic safety and hygiene standards.- -UNDP’s overarching objective in Syria is to deliver much needed early recovery assistance to crisis-affected populations. Access to essential humanitarian services such as health, education, safe water and affordable food are critical to the resilience of vulnerable Syrian communities. UNDP’s assistance to populations in need is prioritized based on independent and thorough needs assessments, such as those presented in the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and UNDP’s specific studies and sector assessments, including conflict sensitivity analyses and protection risk assessments at the field level. UNDP is committed to meeting needs in a principled way that advances basic human rights and mitigates risks across its operations to ensure that assistance is needs based, free from interference, and in line with humanitarian principles.-For further information, please contact:-Giacomo Negrotto, Partnership Development Officer, giacomo.negrotto@undp.org Tel: +963 99 33 38 908-____________________________________________________________-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

The support to be provided through this agreement aims to directly build the resilience of and improve the livelihoods of about 2,000 PWDs and builds on an existing partnership between Finland and UNDP (2018-2022) that has resulted in supporting 5,944 PWDs for physical and mental as well as livelihood support and providing 71 service providers, working in disability inclusion, health, accessibility, psychosocial support, and policy making with capacity building opportunities.-In Syria, more than one in four individuals or 28 percent of the total population aged two and above live with some form of disability. PWDs are disproportionately affected by the ongoing socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external and internal factors, such as the fallout from the Lebanese financial and political crisis, the rapid depreciation of the Syrian currency, and severe inflation, all of which have exacerbated needs. Due to attitudinal, environmental, and institutional barriers that are reproduced in the COVID-19 context, they have faced structural inequalities, undermining their social, economic and health needs.-Finland’s contribution comes at a time when humanitarian needs across Syria are at their most acute since the crisis began, with deteriorating socio-economic conditions and widespread poverty, estimated at 90 percent of the population.-“When people think of war, they usually see mental images of destroyed buildings, but we must not forget that bombings leave their marks on human beings too. The Syrian war that has lasted over 11 years has ravaged the country and had a tremendous impact on the lives of innocent people. We are proud of our long partnership with UNDP who is working on a daily basis in the field helping the most vulnerable Syrians, women and children, to build a better future. I have had the possibility to travel several times to Syria and I’ve seen with my own eyes this sentiment of hope glowing in the faces of all the mothers who wish that someday their children will be able to live their lives fully. With this renewed partnership with UNDP to strengthen resilience we will be able to continue our work with those who are most in need of help in this conflict, the people with disabilities.” said Ms. Tarja Fernadez, Charge d’Affaires of the Embassy of Finland in Syria.-A key component of the project is to improve health and functional outcomes of PWDs by enhancing physical rehabilitation and mental health services. Additionally, the project will enhance the livelihoods of PWDs’ households by improving their access to income-generating activities and other socioeconomic opportunities. This intervention will target PWDs with various livelihood support, including vocational and skills training, employment services, entrepreneurship development and agricultural livelihoods. The project will also aim to address multiple barriers to inclusion by taking a multi-sectoral approach to alleviating physical, legal and social obstacles and creating an enabling environment for inclusion.-“UNDP Syria recognizes disability inclusion as an essential requirement for advancing the implementation of the SDGs and promotes the rights of PWDs in Syria in line with the guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) such as non-discrimination, participation and inclusion, equality of opportunity, respect and dignity, and respect for diversity, which are fundamental for building an inclusive and cohesive society in Syria,” said Ramla Khalidi, Resident Representative of UNDP Syria. “Inclusive policies and programmes are sound investments in society, and both the SDGs and the CRPD are mutually reinforcing and critical for developing an effective disability inclusion and overall early recovery and resilience programme. We are very grateful for the Government of Finland’s continued partnership with UNDP to scale up the scope and coverage of its disability inclusion programme.”-Within the two-year project, UNDP will also strengthen disability support service delivery by developing service delivery’s human and institutional capacities. Such investment will ensure sustainable and quality impacts that will serve many PWDs in the future. Given Finland’s wealth of knowledge, practice, and expertise on disability inclusion, this project will explore new partnerships with Finnish experts and institutions to help develop institutional capacities for PWDs support and disability inclusion.-The project is a critical contribution to UNDP's strategy to support PWDs in Syria which is based on the human rights-based approach to disability in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the CRPD as well as early recovery efforts in its pledge to leave no one behind.-For more information on UNDP Syria see https://www.sy.undp.org.- ",[],Press release

The support to be provided through this agreement aims to directly improve the livelihoods of more than 40,000 people and indirectly support more than 275,000.-Japan’s contribution comes on the eve of the 11-year mark of the crisis in Syria which has resulted in deteriorating socio-economic conditions and widespread poverty, estimated at some 90 per cent of the population. The situation has been worsened by the fallout of COVID-19 and the growing impact of climate change which has fuelled food insecurity throughout the country.-“Japan remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance to support crisis-affected population on the ground in Syria, especially vulnerable groups including women, youth and persons with disabilities. We sincerely hope that our support will help alleviate suffering for as many Syrians as possible and help them to weather the multiple and deepening challenges they are facing,” said Mr. Akira Endo, Special Coordinator for Syria and Charge d’Affaires of the Embassy of Japan in Syria.-A key component of the project is to improve water flow for communities by rehabilitating damaged irrigation networks. Additionally, local farmers will receive equipment and training, enabling them to increase their productivity and grow staple crops. This intervention will help alleviate poverty by creating employment opportunities among vulnerable groups within local communities such as impoverished farmers, women, youth, and persons with disabilities and boosting food security in rural areas. The project will also enhance community safety and access to land by raising awareness about the risks of unexploded ordnance.-""The project will be implemented under the United Nations Humanitarian Response Plan and is designed to strengthen the resilience of communities affected by the crisis in Syria and reduce their dependence on aid,"" said Ramla Khalidi, Resident Representative of UNDP Syria. ""The crisis has severely impacted people’s ability to sustain a living, and to access basic and social services and infrastructure; it has also further undermined social cohesion. Most people in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zour are heavily dependent on farming, and it is critical to scale up interventions in the agricultural sector. We thank the Government of Japan for partnering with UNDP to restore the livelihoods of the most vulnerable in those areas.”-Within the two-year project, UNDP will also support socio-economic empowerment of the vulnerable groups by helping entrepreneurs develop their group-based social businesses. This will be complemented by enhancing agricultural processing and marketing, diversifying income sources, and vocational training around agribusiness to equip the families, particularly women, youth and persons with disabilities with the skills and tools needed to earn an income and secure sustainable employment.- -The project is a critical contribution to UNDP's support to local communities and the request by the United Nations Secretary-General that the UN strengthen its early recovery and resilience activities in the country as part of bolstering the international response.-For more information on UNDP Syria see https://www.sy.undp.org.-*********-UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

The project will assist communities and government in cleaning ash, debris, bricks, cement, rubble and vegetation from the destroyed area, market places, homes and streets to pave the way for rebuilding these areas and allowing safe access to communities and businesses. This essential aid comes at a time when heavy rains are compounding the issue and causing flooding and mudslides in an already tenuous situation. The much-needed clean-up efforts can help mitigate the flooding and will also provide short term financial support to persons who have previously lost their jobs due to COVID-19 in addition to being impacted by the volcanic eruption.
-Leveraging UNDP networks to procure the needed equipment and supplies, the Eastern Caribbean team liaised with the UNDP Trinidad and Tobago team who quickly and efficiently supported this procurement action. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago also lent its assistance and provided freight aboard the Galleons Passage to ship the gear and materials directly to St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The vessel left Trinidad for the Kingstown Port in St. Vincent on April 28, 2021.
-Randi Davis, Resident Representative UNDP Trinidad and Tobago, spoke to the collaborative effort stating, “We were delighted to be part of a coordinated effort to get relief and supplies to the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The national governments of the Caribbean have proven that unity is strength in a time of crises and we at UNDP stand ready to assist countries when they need it most and especially ensure that those most vulnerable receive the assistance they require.”
-The emergency employment programme will require labour as well as tools, equipment and the use of light machinery. Work will be coordinated in partnership with the Ministry of Health, Wellness & the Environment as well as the Ministry of Transport, Works, Lands and Surveys and Physical Planning. Workers will be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, boots, face masks, goggles and helmets, where neccessary. Safety training will be conducted and in keeping with the agency’s mission of building forward better and boosting community resilience, tools and small equipment purchased under the programme will be kept by the community members for their use, after the process is completed.
-As exogenous threats like COVID-19 and the current volcanic eruption in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are impacting the region, it is vital that developmental efforts persist in order to reinforce the need for regional resilience and building forward better. UNDP will continue discussions with donors and partners to accelerate recovery efforts in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This recovery action is part of the work of  UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean in its commitment to promoting economic diversification, job creation and resilience with the ""Blue Economy for Green Islands"" vision. As the Caribbean continues to seek solutions to build resilience and livelihoods for traditionally vulnerable groups, UNDP Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in partnership with governments and stakeholders, remains dedicated to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable development throughout the region and building resilient communities that can withstand shocks and crises through targeted projects and programmes.

It will require the shifting of deeply entrenched social and political norms, embedded within a nation’s history and culture.-According to UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner “Inequality is not just about how much someone earns compared to their neighbour. It is about the unequal distribution of wealth and power: the entrenched social and political norms that are bringing people onto the streets today, with triggers as diverse as - the price of petrol, demands for political freedoms, the pursuit of fairness and justice. This is the new face of inequality and addressing it is not beyond solutions. Recognising it is a first step; what happens next is a choice that each leader must make.”
-The HDR includes a Human Development Index (HDI) for a number of countries and regions, including  Trinidad and Tobago  which ranks high in the HDI - positioned at 63 out of 189 countries. However, a closer disaggregation of the data shows significant gaps and inequalities.-The report notes that in Latin America and the Caribbean, the perception of unfairness in the distribution of wealth has increased since 2012, returning to levels of the late 1990s. Inequality in self-reported happiness (or subjective well-being as it is also called), which had remained steady in the region until 2014, has risen since.-Please see here for the full report: http://hdr.undp.org/

Even though all of this is not directly attributable to wood and charcoal, this represents one of the highest rates of deforestation in Africa. The total charcoal demand in Uganda, according to the National Development Plan III is 2.09 million tonnes as of 2019.-With these growing deforestation realities in Uganda, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), ran a call for innovative solutions to reverse the rapid deforestation in the country. The plan was to identify, test and scale-up the most promising solutions to Uganda’s persistent deforestation trend, birthing the Biomass-to Electricity Pilot Project at Mulago National Referral Hospital.- -The project was officially commissioned by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Development, Hon. Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu at the Mwanamugimu Nutrition Unit. - -During the project commission, the Acting Executive Director Mulago Hospital, Dr. Rose Byanyima, said that the unit on a daily admits or receives 6-10 severely malnourished children.-“These come with severe complications resulting from malnutrition. She adds that such cases of severe malnutrition escalated in Uganda as a result of new sets of constraints that came with the Covid19 lockdown. Others are causes resulting from families being fatally afflicted by HIV-Aids,” Dr. Byanyima said.-The project, which is supported by UNDP, in partnership with Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) is intended to promote the use of electricity for cooking as opposed to use of biomass such as firewood and charcoal and it targets to convert institutions such as hospitals, schools, prisons, and universities, households, and commercial enterprises countrywide, from using biomass-based energy to electrical energy for cooking services.- -The UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Ms. Sheila Ngatia, added that the pilot is meant to be catalytic, bring on board the right partnerships, and foster learning to drive several systemic changes to scale the use of electricity for cooking in social institutions and households.-“This experiment, in addition to informing the design of cooking tariffs, will also potentially inform the regulatory environment for the importation, local production, maintenance and pricing of cooking equipment for large institutions and households,” said Ms. Sheila Ngatia-She further said, “we have the bigger role of converting these learnings into processes that trigger structural transformations in our electricity tariffs, in the pricing of cooking appliances, in our cooking behaviors calling for collaboration from the public sector, our private sector and development partners,” and reiterated UNDP’s continued support to resource mobilize to scale up the initiative. - -While commissioning the project, Hon. Nankabirwa noted that biomass is still the primary source of Energy for cooking, with over 96 per cent of the population relying on charcoal or firewood attributing this to tradition, limited access to other sources of Energy and low levels of awareness. The Minister added that this creates serious health challenges to the Country’s population with research revealing diverse respiratory complications such as acute respiratory infections especially in infants. It is on this basis that she implored ERA and other Electricity Sub-sector players to address the bottlenecks to achieving a full transition of the population from using biomass-based energy to using electricity noting that a healthy population, clean and healthy environment guarantee the country the desired sustainable development. However, there are fears of high Electricity Tariffs and unreliable power supply. - -According to ERA, there is a designed Special Tariff of 451.4 Uganda Shillings per Kilowatt Hour for institutions and 412 Uganda Shillings per Kilowatt Hour for Domestic consumers under this project. 14.-“We are looking at further lowering the Tariffs as the consumption of Electricity grows. On the issue of Reliability of Electricity Supply, we have put in place a mechanism for enforcing responsiveness to improve the performance of licensees to deliver a quality and reliable service,” said Chief Executive Officer, ERA, Eng.

This landmark conference came up with key proclamations duped the Stockholm Declaration and Action Plan for the Human Environment that embodied key principles.-Fifty years after the Stockholm Declaration, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly made a decision through two resolutions to convene an international meeting entitled Stockholm+50 under the theme “a healthy planet for the prosperity of all - our responsibility, our opportunity”, in Stockholm, on the 2nd  - 3rd  June 2022, during the week of World Environment Day (WED). This is to commemorate 50 years since the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. It is designed to help accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during the Decade of Action, including a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.- -Uganda’s High Level Preparatory Meeting.-The Stockholm+50 national consultations started with a high-level preparatory meeting where discussions of the plan and key considerations to consider during the consultations were made.-For the meeting, the Minister of State for Environment Hon. Beatrice Anywar, and the Ambassador of Sweden – Ambassador (Amb).  Maria Håkansson were welcomed by the United Nations Resident Coordinator (RC) – Ms. Susan Namondo Ngongi and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Resident Representative - Ms. Elsie Attafuah and other stake holders on the 31st of March 2022 at UNDP Uganda offices.- They discussed a series of suggestions to look at the national consultations not only as a preparation process but as one that eventually influences how Uganda strategically uses nature, environment, climate actions to promote inclusive sustainable development, strengthen cooperation and accelerate innovative action towards national development, whilst contributing to global commitments.   -The meeting also recommended the inclusion of Government and non-state actors specifically the indigenous people, representatives from the local government, private sector, youth, and the Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).- -Uganda Launches the Stockholm+50 National Consultations.- -The Stockholm+50 national consultations were launched on Friday, 22nd April 2022 at Protea Hotel, Kampala. The key stake holders include the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Water and Environment in partnership with UNDP and with support from the Government of Sweden. The consultations begun with the active engagement and participation of young people.-With UNDP leading Global consultations in 60 countries - the national consultation process stimulated inclusive whole-of-society and whole-of-Government dialogue on the main themes of Stockholm+50 initiative that include three leadership dialogues which are expected to yield clear and concrete recommendations for action at all levels in Uganda;-Speaking during the Launch, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Water and Environment – Mr. Alfred Okot Okidi, urged that the national consultations should be more actionable and inclusive for everybody to participate, highlighting the need for more climate financing, technology transfer and capacity building.-“A healthy environment is a responsibility for all of us, it is a personal responsibility, it is a community responsibility, it is a national responsibility, but also a global responsibility, there is need for everybody to play their part; and the need to ensure that action is taken, he said during the Launch.-Similarly, Edwin Muhumuza from Youth Go Green, Uganda emphasized that the youth have a responsibility to speak up and safeguard the environment for a better future for all.-“If we, the youth, do not have the responsibility to safeguard our environment, how will our future be? If we do not wake up and act, what will the world look like in 50 years. We can't see our natural resources being degraded, our precious gifts being taken away and we keep quiet. We must speak up about these things.” – he said emphasized during the youth Consultations.- -What stockholm+50 initiative means for Uganda.-Stockholm+50 represents an opportunity to think and act beyond individual challenges but towards a systemic approach – one that builds on existing initiatives and agreements and takes them one step forward. It offers an opportunity to mark a milestone on how we conceive and deliver on human well-being, capabilities, and freedoms by focusing on the needs of humankind in the 21st century.-Beyond UN Member States, stakeholders include organizations and bodies of the UN system, intergovernmental organizations, international financial institutions, civil society groups, indigenous peoples’ organizations, academic institutions, the scientific community, the youth, the private sector, and philanthropic organizations who will have the opportunity to amplify their voices to influence national debates.-During her speech, Amb. Maria Håkansson highlighted the opportunity the initiative brings to Uganda saying it will serve as a platform to learn from other best practices to build back better and greener from COVID-19.-“This is an opportunity to celebrate 50years of multilateral collaboration on environment, it is an urgent time to start implementing of lots of commitments, to take bold actions, to learn from each other’s best practices, and to look at different practices that are linked, like environment and climate.” She said during the launch.-On her part, the acting Resident Representative, Ms. Sheila Ngatia urged at the time is now for accelerating actions to achieve the 2030 Agenda and beyond and she highlighted that the youth, women, and indigenous population are vital going forward.-“The time is now for accelerating actions to achieve the 2030 Agenda and beyond, complement the important spaces that have been created for discussing and resolving the climate, nature and pollution challenges posed to development and health.” She said.-Stockholm+ 50 initiative is a critical milestone towards renewed multilateralism and strengthened global solidarity. It is a time for bold action and engagement by acknowledging and highlighting the need for international unity, reciprocity, and diversity. This is a time for all actors to find their unique place in a global system, in collaboration with others, to embrace new ideas and commit to a shared responsibility for a better future on a healthy planet with prosperity for all, with a focus on principles of intergenerational responsibility, inclusive participation and interconnections, and implementation opportunities.

Supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the half-day workshop was held on the 10th of March 2022 at Kampala Serena Hotel. Graced by the Minister of State for Environment Hon. Beatrice Anywar, the Post COP26 workshop gathered stakeholders around the country, who included the United Nations family, representatives from the British High Commission, representatives from embassies, research, academic institutions, youth, civil society organizations (CSOs) among others.-During the workshop, discussions on the implications and opportunities that COP26 presents for Uganda were discussed. Stakeholders discussed how key outcomes on adaptation, technology, and finance among others would be integrated into country planning priorities, particularly the implementation of the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). -The need to develop a framework for monitoring the implementation of these outcomes was considered important as it would provide inputs into the road map to COP27, which is expected to take place in Egypt where Uganda and Africa are expected to push for support on clean energy transition, implementation of climate change plans among other development priorities, ensuring that the continent optimizes financial benefits from her oil and gas.-In a similar way, discussions on the integration of capacity building for beneficiaries as one of the key climate change interventions were emphasized not forgetting the issues of gender mainstreaming and the consideration of the special position of youth, People with Disability (PWDs) in climate action. - - -During the workshop Hon. Beatrice Anywar emphasized the need for everybody to collectively participate in climate change mitigation and urged all Ugandans and local consumers to say no to destructive products.-“We the consumers of plastic and the end-game sufferers of climate change need to say ""NO"" to destructive products,” she emphasized.-She continued to challenge participants to demonstrate commitment to climate action, noting that climate action starts with individual behaviors and actions.-“All our works must be aligned with planting indigenous trees to restore our national forests that have fallen victim to the deforestation activities in Uganda,” she said. - - -To stimulate critical reflection and discussions, the UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Ms. Sheila Ngatia posed key questions:-“Is there the provision of means of implementation in the COP26 outcomes for Uganda’s NDC, and to ensure the realization of the enhanced ambition?-a) As a country, how can we boost national readiness to capitalize on article 6 that opens the way for market mechanism especially carbon trade?-b) What are the implications for Uganda in COP26 failing to have a decision on loss and damage mindful of the frequent climate -induced floods and landslides that the country experiences?-c) There is a continuous call for the engagement of non-state actors in boosting climate actions. As a nation, how do we plan to implement the engagement of civil society, private sector, academia, youth among others?” She asked during the national Post COP26 workshop at Serena Hotel, Kampala. - - -As a way forward in scaling and amplifying the voices of young people, UNDP in Uganda supported a youth representative to attend the COP26 in Glasgow UK - it is important to provide a platform and see more young people attend and showcase their innovations and be part of key world decisions.-“I appreciate the support of UNDP and for the support that is being given to young people acting and innovating in the climate spaces across the country. I am a firm believer in the school of through that unleashing the energy & creativity of young people starts with providing them with the right platforms, the right opportunities & the right collaborations. As young people, with the support of our leaders say the Climate Change Department in Uganda, we can create more platforms of engagement.”- Juliet Grace Luwedde, said during the workshop.-Implications of COP26 Outcomes for Uganda-One of the key goals of COP26 was to influence policies that would enable the world to achieve net-zero. This means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a level where global warming will be kept under 1.5°C and as a result, retaining a planet that is liveable for communities and nature. Despite Uganda being a low carbon economy, it is at risk to natural disasters caused by extreme weather events, which has led to mudslides, landslides and flooding, particularly for the Country’s Mountain regions and related districts such as Mbale in the Mountain Elgon region.-Climate change is predicted to have a significant impact on Uganda. The national-level studies show that if no adaptive action is taken, annual costs could be in the range of US$3.2 - 5.9 billion within a decade, with the biggest impact being on water, followed by energy, agriculture, and infrastructure. For over 40 years from 2010 to 2050, the costs of inaction are estimated between US$273 - 437 billion. Even if there were no further increases in climate impacts, the cost of inaction would rise over time because of an increase in population. Poor and vulnerable groups are mostly likely to be impacted through damages to their assets, livelihoods, and their food security.-With these key outcomes, the next step for Uganda is to ensure that the country has the required means of implementation of the targets set in the climate change policies and strategies such as the National Climate Change Act, the revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), Long term Low Carbon Development Strategy (LTS), Green Growth Development Strategy, among others. This can be achieved through effective capacity building, increased access to climate financing, technology to ensure effective implementation of key climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in sectors including agriculture, forestry, water, energy, transport, water and sanitation, infrastructure, among others. Key interventions include promoting climate-resilient and low carbon agricultural production and value chains, promoting land management practices that promote sustainable and productive use of land, climate-resilient water supply systems, sustainable management of ecosystems, strengthening climate information services, promoting education on climate science, increase efficiency in the use of biomass in the energy sector and promotion of the use of alternative/renewable energy sources. - ","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 07', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 16']","Climate change,Uganda,Goal 13  Climate action,Damage and loss,Goal 16  Peace, justice and strong institutions,News,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,Goal 7  Affordable and clean energy,Newsletter,English"

This follows a prior meeting that was conducted on 15 November 2019 in Kampala by the Ugandan Ministry of Water and Environment and the Water Convention Secretariat which is hosted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) to increase awareness and understanding of the Convention with officials, including those from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development.-The overall objective was to inform stakeholders about the Water Convention, to share the processes initiated by Government of Uganda to become a party to the Water Convention and to discuss the next steps in the accession process.-What the Water convention means for Uganda.-Uganda, which has 98% of its water resources in the Nile River Basin, has taken numerous measures to promote cooperation with neighboring States in the management and development of its shared waters, in accordance with the provisions of international law. Uganda has ratified the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) and hosts the secretariat of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) in Entebbe. Additionally, Uganda is party to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Kenya regarding the Sio-Malaba-Malakisi (SMM) transboundary basin is in its final stages. -The secretariat of the Water Convention was directly involved in supporting the development of the SMM Basin Investment Framework which led to the development of the SMM MoU. Adopted on 17 March 1992 in Helsinki, Finland, the Water Convention aims to strengthen cooperation in the field of transboundary waters and to promote protection and sustainable use of transboundary surface waters and groundwaters. Initially limited to the UNECE pan-European region, the Water Convention has been opened for accession by all United Nations Member States, since 1 March 2016. Five African countries have already acceded to it (Chad, Senegal, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau and Togo) and many others are in various stages of the process of accession.-The Water Convention, and the 1997 United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (Watercourses Convention) – together known as the “United Nations global water conventions” – provide  unique global legal frameworks to support cooperative development and prevent conflicts related to shared waters. Furthermore, the Water Convention has a dynamic institutional framework which acts as an essential intergovernmental platform within the United Nations system for promoting transboundary water cooperation at the global level. Both conventions are mutually complementary, and the United Nations Secretary-General encourages countries to accede to and implement them.- -Let’s hear from the key speakers of the workshop.-As the chief guest, Hon. Sam Cheptoris while giving remarks aired out how Uganda has since 1960s acted as a moderator of downstream-upstream dialogue and played a key role in the finalization and signing of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) and has been engaging other countries in the basin to resolve the disagreements over CFA.-“I wish to take this opportunity to welcome you all for this national workshop, where issues of transboundary water cooperation will be discussed, and justification as to why Uganda should accede to the Water Convention will be presented leading to a road map for accession.” he said during the workshop.-Ms. Sonja Koeppel, highlighted the great step taken to integrate a dedicated goal on water (SDG indicator 6.5.2) which was included in the Sustainable development goals (SDGs) but also is a requirement for countries to implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation.-“Today's workshop represents an important step and unique opportunity for thoroughly analyzing the obligations of the Convention, the practical tools it offers to support countries' efforts, and the benefits and risks, if any, associated with its accession. It is important that this workshop results in a clear commitment and roadmap for accession.” She said, during the national workshop at Protea Hotel in Entebbe.-On her part, Ms. Caroline Adriaensen, emphasized how the national workshop will help bring all parties to a common level of perspective on the cooperation framework of the Water Convention.-“I believe that for Uganda to join the UNECE Water Convention would come with many benefits. Apart from providing international principles, standards and practises necessary for the sound management of international watercourses, it would send an unmistakable signal to international water actors that Uganda is keen on cooperation, thus ultimately helping unlock and share the many benefits accruing from water.” She said while making her speech at Protea Hotel in Entebbe, Uganda.-Mr. Harry Liiv, Special Envoy for Transboundary Waters at the Ministry of the Environment in Estonia and Chair of the Bureau of the Water Convention disclosed that the Convention will enable better management for water resources and will also promote bilateral cooperation with neighboring countries.-Mr. Alfred Okot Okidi, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Water and Environment, said that the preparatory meetings are going on to help address the challenges ahead of the accession process and that once the convention is ratified Uganda will enjoy great benefits on various water sources and international lakes.-UNDP’S Water and Ocean Governance programme.-“The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projects and programmes bring a diverse suite of actors together to jointly protect ecosystems and ensure the sustainable use of water and ocean resources to build equitable, inclusive, and sustainable societies. Supporting transboundary resources’ management is part of that effort.” Ms. Elsie Attafuah-Ms. Attafuah also re-echoed the call to action by the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Amina Mohammed, at the Africa Water and Sanitation Week in November 2021. Ms. Mohammed set out three immediate priorities to urgently accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 on clean water and sanitation for all.-At a global level, the UNDP Water and Ocean Governance Programme (WOGP) helps countries achieve integrated, climate-resilient, sustainable, and equitable management of water and ocean resources, and universal access to safe water supply and sanitation. Addressing the triple crisis of climate change, waste, and landscape degradation to save surface and ground waters requires an integrated approach and a good framework for multi-stakeholder engagement.-At the regional level, UNDP supports sustainable management of transboundary waters. For example, UNDP is working with the NBI together with the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) in seven countries to enhance collaborative management of surface and ground water resources in selected transboundary aquifers in seven countries of the Nile Basin.-At the national level, and in the case of Uganda, current work on landscape and wetland restoration is a clear testimony of our commitment to support the protection and sustainable management of Uganda’s freshwater ecosystems.  Recognizing that wetlands are the natural filters and purifiers of ground water system, UNDP has partnered with the Government of Uganda, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Austrian Development Agency on an ambitious programme to restore over 70,000 Hectares of wetlands in 24 districts in Eastern and Southwestern Uganda.-We also recognize that land use and landcover change, including urbanization, is exerting pressure on water resources and aquatic ecosystems. This ranges from poor waste management, pollution, and destruction of important water catchment which are impacting both surface and underground water systems.-Supporting international frameworks and treaties on transboundary water resources will therefore be critical to Uganda’s efforts on conservation and enjoyment of her water resources and associated biodiversity. The 1992 Water Convention and the 1997 Watercourses Convention together provide the global platforms for transboundary cooperation to support Uganda in its shared water management, including enhancing existing, or supporting new, bilateral and basin agreements and institutions.","['Icon of SDG 06', 'Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 14', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Uganda,Goal 13  Climate action,Goal 14  Life below water,Goal 6  Clean water and sanitation,News,Newsletter,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,English"

The thirteenth and fifteenth Sustainable Development Goals encourage us to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts to   protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss. Achieving this requires our collective commitment and action against wetland encroachment.-""Carbon is building up everyday in the atmosphere causing global warming, drought, floods and many diseases as we have recently witnessed with the flooding of Lake Victoria. Unless we commit ourselves and channel all our efforts towards restoration of Uganda’s wetlands, the future is very oblique for us,"" said Sam Cheptoris, Minister for Water and Environment, Uganda during the 2nd February 2022, World Wetlands Day held at Gayaza playgrounds, Kimanya – Kabonera Division in Masaka City.-This year’s World Wetlands Day was observed under the theme “Wetlands Action for People and Nature” which require both state and non-state actors to invest more financial, human, and political capital to save the world’s wetlands from disappearing and to restore those that have been degraded.-In line with the theme, the minister ordered for the immediate restoration of Katonga swamp in Masaka. It is in the catchment area of Lake Victoria and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention and provides a spawning ground for mudfish and lungfish, as well as supports globally threatened bird species and the endangered Sitatunga.-In 2019, The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) stopped Zetong Bang Limited, Chinese Company, from carrying out any activity in Katonga wetland. This followed reports that the company had violated the conditions of the user permit which had been granted to them. The illegal activities of the company were exposed by the then Masaka LC V Chairperson, Jude Mbabali.-Also in attendance was the UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Ms. Sheila Ngatia who represented the United Nations in Uganda among other dignitaries.-She urged all citizens and indeed all stakeholders in Uganda to collectively support efforts geared towards halting further degradation of Uganda’s wetlands, which have a direct impact on the quality and quantity of water across the country.-She also expressed delight at the Wetlands Atlas by Government in partnership with the United Nations Development programme (UNDP) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and “has played an essential role in informing policy makers and the public to take action on several wetland demarcation and restoration activities.”-She further commended the Government of Uganda for drafting a Ten-Year Action Plan for restoration of environmental and natural resources (2021 to 2030) and a decision to cancel illegal land titles located in critical urban wetlands.-The World Wetlands Day provides the opportunity for us to take stock of our actions towards wetland conservation and raise awareness about the value of wetlands for humanity and the planet.-The commemorative activities for this year’s celebration include seminars, nature walks, restoration of degraded wetlands, planting of trees and exhibitions.-The United Nations General Assembly on 30th August 2021 proclaimed the 2nd day of February as World Wetlands Day to raise awareness of the twin urgency of reversing the accelerating loss of wetlands and to promote the conservation and restoration of wetlands. Wetland action has two main aims, promoting ecologically sustainable management of wetland resources to meet social – economic needs and maintain ecosystem services and integrating socially sensitive wetland management strategies for the long-term enhancement of livelihoods and poverty reduction.-Role of wetlands to the environment.-Wetlands play vital ecological and socio-economic functions such as flood mitigation, water purification, erosion prevention, moderation of extreme flows of water, maintenance of water tables in surrounding lands, and providing habitat for numerous species of animals and plants that contribute to a rich biodiversity. Wetlands are also essential for food, medicines, water supply, fisheries, dry season grazing for livestock, nutrient retention, elimination of toxins, tourism, and recreational use among other benefits.-Yet despite the myriad benefits they provide, wetlands are among the ecosystems with the highest rates of decline, loss, and degradation. Wetlands are disappearing three times faster than forests and are Earth’s most threatened ecosystem.-In Uganda, wetlands continue to be degraded and the current area of wetlands across the country is below that recorded in the 1990s. In the urban areas, there is indiscriminate encroachment for expansion of human settlements while in the rural areas there is steady conversion of wetlands for agricultural use. According to the Uganda Wetlands Atlas Volume II, developed by the Government  in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the national area of wetlands declined by 30 per cent between 1994 and 2008. And although between 2008 and 2014, there was an increase in area under wetlands, this has been a paltry 0.03 per cent increase: from 26,307km2 in 2008 to 26,315 km2 in 2014 (MWE, 2014).-“Now more than ever government of Uganda is committed to financing and enforcing wetlands management through stake holder engagements, creating innovative land scape mmanagement practices and providing alternative livelihood options. Wetlands are home to a variety of natural creatures, they offer alternative livelihoods, mitigate floods, filtrate water bodies and harbor papyrus a raw material for basket weaving. If we want to destroy Uganda lets destroy wetlands,” Said Mr. Alfred Okot Okidi, the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Water and Environment.-UNDP’s role in wetland restoration-UNDP is working with the Government of Uganda, through the Ministry of Water and Environment to restore wetlands across the country and improve their management. The “Building Resilient Communities Wetland Ecosystems and Associated Catchments in Uganda”, an initiative of the Government of Uganda, UNDP, and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is supporting the restoration and management of wetlands facing severe encroachment in 24 districts in eastern and western Uganda. -The project is building the capacity of wetlands adjacent communities to implement livelihood and economic activities that support sustainable wetlands conservation. This is not only important in enabling Uganda to meet her obligations of reducing carbon emissions but also will increase the appreciation of wetlands as an important resource for socio-economic transformation of communities and landscapes that house important wetlands.-Recently, the Austrian Development Agency partnered with UNDP and the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Water and Environment to extend wetland restoration activities in five districts of Kaliro, Kibuku, Butaleja, Namutumba and Budaka. These interventions are aligned to and support Government of Uganda aspirations on wetlands management and ecosystems restoration, environment, and natural resource conversation as enshrined in the Uganda Vision 2040 and the third National Development Plan (NDPIII) 2020-2025.-The United Nations in Uganda is working with the government on several initiatives geared towards protecting wetlands as nature-based solutions for tackling climate change and realization of SDGs.","['Icon of SDG 13', 'Icon of SDG 15']","Goal 15  Life on land,Uganda,Goal 13  Climate action,Climate change and disaster risk reduction,News,Newsletter,English"

Now in its final year of implementation, the Uganda Host and Refugee Community Empowerment Project 2019-2022 has created economic opportunities in communities and impacted the lives of many who have fled from war, violence, conflict or persecution to find safety in Uganda, giving them a fresh start at life.-The project is implementing schemes for emergency employment, vocational training, value chain development and structured community mobilization and messaging to empower people and address the root causes of gender inequality and gender-based violence (GBV). The project is implemented as part and contributes to the current UNDP Emergency Response and Resilience Strategy, based on the Humanitarian Development and Peace (HDP) Nexus and Refugee and Host Population Empowerment (REHOPE) Frameworks of United Nations and Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) of the Government of Uganda.-By December 2021, this project had disbursed UGX 2.4 billion via cash-for-work activities and supported 10,040 beneficiaries, surpassing the total target beneficiary number of 7,200. The project also established 341 Village Saving and Loans Associations (VSLAs) and facilitated micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with start-up business grants. The total grants disbursed is UGX 700 million for 3,037 individual MSME owners/starters, with various trainings in business skills, financial literacy, and vocational training for youth having also been provided.-The project is now entering the second stage of value chain development/improvement to boost the local economy and give better business opportunities after emergency support (Phase I) and business recovery (Phase II).- -Individual start-up business grant: Jennifer’s Story-Individual beneficiaries have different accounts of how the project has impacted their lives.  Ms. Jennifer Foni, 40, fled to Uganda in 2016 from South Sudan and temporarily settled in Nyumanzi Reception Center of Nyumanzi settlement, later moving to Maaji II settlement in Adjumani District. During her stay in the various settlement camps, Foni, a single mother of 8 children has tried different income generating activities ranging from selling vegetables, running a grocery shop, growing crops, woodlot planting and road construction.-Foni participated in woodlot and road construction as part of the project’s cash-for-work activities, earning UGX 11,000 (about USD 3) daily. She used the earnings to strengthen her business (food items) which steadily picked up and has since expanded into a full-fledged kiosk selling fruits and general groceries. - -She has also undergone several financial literacy and business skills trainings held as part of the project offer which have enhanced her business acumen and improved her savings and financial discipline. Now Foni dedicates a generous amount to savings in two Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) groups in her area. These groups have impacted her life financially but also socially,-“I have made friends in our savings group and improved my earnings. We are like a family and support each other in times of need,” said Foni.- -From the business, Foni earns between UGX 400,000-600,000 per month with a net profit of about UGX 200,000. From these earnings, Foni meets her home basic needs such as food, transport and school fees and medication for her children.-Group start-up business grant: Modern Hybrid Group in Poultry Business-The project also supported 221 group businesses to start or scale up, one such business being the Modern Hybrid Group in Obongi District. The group comprises 18 members (5 males, 13 females), all refugees from South Sudan, and was formed as a VSLA after participating in Pasu road opening and woodlot planting in March 2021. Since the group was established, members have saved group business money from cash-for-work income and also received a business grant of UGX 8 million for the poultry business. They initially bought 150 chicks and have sold 50 birds so far, remaining with 100 which they are selling to the local community. The group plans to expand the business buying 400 more chicks as well as starting up market vending, goat rearing, and petty trades in 2022.- -Ms. Lilian Keliki, a member of Modern Hybrid Poultry Business Group, is 35-year-old from South Sudan with seven children. She arrived in Uganda in 2017 wholly dependent on food rations provided for in the refugee camps which she said were not enough for her family. Later she was selected to take part in woodlot planting and crop growing which has transformed her life.-“My children became healthier after I participated in the project,” she said. “I used the money from cash-for-work and put it into the savings groups. I participated in the group business and I was in charge of feeding chicks. I could earn extra money to support my children. We can now afford two meals a day unlike in the past when we had only one meal.”-“I also took the psychosocial support from the project and learned how to manage the problems and disturbing memories I carried from the past during the war in South Sudan. It helped me to take care of my children well. I feel stronger than before mentally and physically.”-Other beneficiaries welcomed the diversification to include crop and animal husbandry, saying that it is difficult to earn money only with crop planting in Obongi because of flooding.-Vocational Training – Carpentry: Charles’ Story-Charles Lou, 40, underwent carpentry and joinery for three months and later used the skills and earnings to start a carpentry workshop. A South Sudanese national, Lou and his colleagues used to spend most of their time on games before the TVET training. Now they are involved in productive and income generating activities. Lou also recounts difficulties in providing for his family of eight children and two wives before the project,-“I used to rely on my wife who by that time was selling food items in the market. This was so hard for me because I was incapable of supporting my family financially,” said Lou, adding that the vocational training he attended was a game changer. After the training, Lou engaged in woodlot planting, a cash-for-work activity where he earned UGX 400,000 (about USD 114) cash that he used to start a carpentry workshop at his home specializing in making beds, tables, doors and cupboards.- -“It costs me about UGX 38,000 (USD 10) to buy the necessary items to make items such as tables which I sell at UGX 70,000 (USD 20) giving me a profit of about UGX 32,000 (about USD 9.). Lou adds that every month he makes an overall profit of between UGX 120,000 (USD 34) and UGX 150,000, (USD 42) making and using this money to save in VSLAs, take care of his family and expand his business.-Today, Lou’s carpentry employs two people and plans to teach more members the skills he acquired. He however calls for longer vocational training citing challenges in capacity building with the shorter trainings.-“I appreciate the vocational training; however, the three months are not enough to acquire all the skills. There are some items we are unable to make because we are incapacitated by the skills that we have.” ","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 05', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 10']","Goal 1  No poverty,Uganda,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 5  Gender equality,News,Newsletter,English"

Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and anger. This is evident in the glaring effects of climate change including rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, floods which affect crop production and lead to crop failure, low yields, loss of income to farmers, food insecurity, hunger and starvation.-These occurrences affect the achievement of the sustainable development goals and particularly efforts to end poverty and hunger. It is against this background that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries supported by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) started the “Enhancing Resilience of Agricultural Landscapes and Value Chains in Eastern Uganda” project to promote Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) best practices that farmers can adopt to create resilience under such conditions.-Implemented in the districts of Kamuli, Kaliro, Buyende, Bugiri, Busia, Budaka, and Namutumba between January 2018 and December 2021, the project sought to increase land productivity through promoting conservation of soil and water resources, building capacities of farmers, school pupils and extension officers at Local Government levels and strengthening resilience to climate change and increasing the number of farmers using CSA practices.-Project benefits-The project has had multiple benefits. Prior to the project, farmers in Bulondo Village, Kamuli district were experiencing food insecurity, poverty and prolonged drought. This has been mitigated thanks to the adoption of CSA practices.-“From the project, I learnt of many CSA methods and technologies, and I chose to start with permanent planting basins. Because these are deep, they collect and save water for the plants, prevent any runoff water from leaving the garden thereby trapping any nutrients that may be running with it and traps it in the basins. This helps the crops to grow healthy even when there are low levels of rainfall,” said Sharifa Ntono, a youth farmer and President of Young Generation Bandela Farmers Centre International, based in Bulondo village.-Ntono, who has been with the project since its inception in 2018, adds that many other farmers who have embraced CSA practices are harvesting more yields compared to those that did not. Before the adoption of permanent planting basins, Ntono harvested 300-500kg of maize per acre but when she used permanent planting basins, she is now harvesting between 1,500-3,000kg. - -Solution to the scarce rains-Yet Ntonto is not alone. In Namutumba, a district known for irregular rains punctuated by a series of droughts and sandy soils which affect crop production because they don’t conserve water for long, CSA approaches like point application of organic fertilizers and use of rippers have helped farmers escape dry spells, expand existing crop acreages, and commercialize maize production.-The use of rip lines has been a game changer in this area and has helped farmers plant early given that they are made in the dry season before the start of planting rains to harvest and conserve rainwater as soon as it comes. This helps crops to escape short season soil moisture deficits. The rip lines enable plant roots to grow deeper into the soil and utilize the stored dry season soil moisture to meet crop water requirements.-Use of the tractor drawn rippers to make rip lines and herbicides for weed control has made land preparation, commercialization, planting and weed control work easier and enabled farmers to plant early and expand acreages cultivated. These practices have enabled farmer engagement in large scale production and increased crop production.
-A combination of permanent planting basins, rippers, contour bands, and mulching have reduced soil erosion in the area. According to Moses Kidangole, a maize and soya beans farmer and chairperson of Bukenga Akanabala Farmers’ Cooperative Society, Bugobi Town Council, Namutumba District, nothing compares to CSA practices when it comes to increasing crop productivity.-“For me I don’t know what our great grandchildren will eat if they don’t adopt CSA. It is only CSA that can improve crop production, improve food security and incomes to farmers in Namutumba,”. Rippers have transformed Kidangole’s farming capacity from subsistence to commercial agriculture. -Good feeding improves learning and the performance of schools-In Budaka district, where lack of food was one of the causes of school dropouts and poor academic performance, the project has helped improve school feeding programmes. The availability of food for learners improved school performance because the children did not have hunger as the reason to keep away from school.-At Suni Primary School, one of the benefiting schools, project activities have scaled up food production according to David Mbayo, the Secretary of the CSA Club and Director of Studies. He says that the USD 10,000 grant the school received as part of the project has enabled the school to fence off six acres of school land to prevent theft and animal grazing and also procured all farm input required to start the school garden. -As a result, Mbayo says that the recent re-opening of schools found them ready because they had enough food in storage. He revealed that even during the closure of the schools due to COVID-19, the school continued to farm with the pupils from the neighborhood and cultivated maize, potatoes and vegetables. These pupils have in turn taught their parents how to use CSA technologies thus creating complete cycle of food security.","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 02', 'Icon of SDG 03', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 13']","Goal 3  Good health and well-being,Goal 1  No poverty,Uganda,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 2  Zero hunger,Goal 13  Climate action,News,UNDP,Newsletter,English"

This year’s theme focuses   on “Sustainable Mountain Tourism”.-The tourism sector remains one of the fastest growing economic sectors in Uganda. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the tourism sector was contributing 6.2% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (over USD 2bn) and employing 589,300 people - 3.6 % of total employment. The outbreak of COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on the tourism industry with visitors and number of persons employed by the industry going down to about 473,000 and 386,200 respectively in 2020. 
-Sustainable tourism in mountains can contribute to creating additional and alternative livelihood options and promote poverty alleviation, social inclusion, as well as landscape and biodiversity conservation. It is a way to preserve the natural, cultural, and spiritual heritage, to promote local crafts and high value products, and celebrate many traditional practices such as local festivals.-The lessons we are learning from COVID-19 point at the need to rethink the competitiveness and resilience models of the tourism industry.  UNDP has therefore partnered with the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities, Uganda Tourism Board, Uganda Wildlife Authority, the Uganda Wildlife Education Center, Cultural Institutions like the Kingdom of Tooro, and the Private Sector to implement the UNDP Rapid Financing Facility (RFF) which is a USD 2 million initiative designed to harness nature, culture, and digital technology and stimulate recovery and build a resilient tourism industry in Uganda. 
-The project is being piloted in the Rwenzori Tourism Development Area, in supporting national efforts to recover the tourism sector through greener development pathways to create jobs for the youth, women, and men and to rebuild resilient livelihoods. It is also promoting recovery of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), supporting strategic reorientation of tourism policy towards inclusive green recovery, enhancing capacities of national systems to boost the tourism industry, and building an active innovation ecosystem with accelerated digital transformation.- -The project commenced through a UNDP and Uganda Tourism Board partnership with Mr. Joshua Cheptegei the 5,000m and 10,000m world record holder, and current 5,000m Olympic Champion leading a team on an expedition in December 2020 to climb the Rwenzori Mountains in Kasese. The expedition included Dr. Lily Ajarova, Chief Executive Officer at Uganda Tourism Board; Moses Golola, champion kickboxer; and other local mountaineering enthusiasts who summited the third tallest mountain range in Africa, to climb the peak of the Rwenzori mountains. This move was intended to illuminate the tourism potential of the Rwenzori and highlight the need for concerted effort to tackle biodiversity loss and combat climate change which has caused rapid loss of the glaciers on Mt.Rwenzori and as well as the endangering of wildlife living in areas around the mountain.- -The expedition on Mt. Rwenzori has been documented and the film was premiered in November 2021 in Fort Portal during the Ekyooto Ha Mpango Tourism Festival. The Mountains of the Moon Documentary showcases the beauty of the Rwenzori Mountain range and drives domestic and international tourist traffic to experience the mountain and National Park; highlight the need for collective efforts to diversify Uganda’s tourism product range to include mountain communities in the tourism value chain whilst protecting natural and cultural resources; showcase the investment opportunities in the mountain destination; and compliment the efforts of the Government of Uganda and the Private Sector to build an inclusive, sustainable and resilient tourism industry. -Through this initiative to rebuild the tourism industry, UNDP is supporting efforts to broaden community participation in the tourism value chain and effectively harness the country’s rich natural and cultural heritage, while capitalizing on the digital economy.  -UNDP supported the Kingdom of Tooro, working in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities,  as well as the private sector, to launch an exciting tourism product - Ekyooto Ha Mpango – which is a cultural festival showcasing Tooro Kingdom’s rich history and cultural heritage; exhibiting innovations that emanate from the wider Rwenzori region; marketing businesses and investment opportunities in the region; and providing a platform to engage in inclusive conversations on the integration of culture and communities in the tourism business ecosystem.-The Ekyooto Ha Mpango featured events such as a tree planting campaign, Business Clinics to promote community participation in the Tourism Business Ecosystem, Sporting activities such as a mini marathon, a boating regatta, cycling, royal guided tours of the Sempaya Hot Springs, Chimp tracking in Kibaale Forest (the Chimp Capital of the World), and Royal guided tours of King Oyo’s Model Farm to inspire and train youth in modern farming practices. -During the Ekyooto Ha Mpango celebrations that happened from the 24th to the 28th of November 2021, Ms. Elsie Attafuah, the UNDP Resident Representative echoed her pleasure, last December, in seeing-off a team to climb to the peak of the spectacular snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains. The expedition funded by UNDP was intended to showcase the beauty of the Rwenzori Mountain; drive tourism traffic to experience the enchanted adventure that the mountain offers; and exhibit the investment opportunities that abound in the mountain destination.-UNDP’s deliberate intention was also to stimulate and harness the power of culture, biodiversity, and tourism to build forward better and greener whilst reducing poverty, creating jobs and livelihood opportunities for young people; and incentivizing environmental conservation – a triple-win for Uganda’s transition towards a more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient economy.
-The Rwenzori mountains, is the largest in Africa (120km long /65Km wide) with an altitude range of 1600m to 5109m above Sea Level, making it the highest mountain in Uganda and third in Africa. It is the tallest horst mountain, standing at 5109 m above sea level (Margherita peak).-Mountain tourism attracts around 15 to 20 percent of global tourism.  As Uganda and world work to rebuild the tourism sector, there is a huge opportunity in harnessing the potential mountains offer. Uganda is endowed with Mountains – The Mountains of the Moon in Rwenzori in the West, Mountain Elgon in the East, and Mountain Moroto in the North East, these are assets we must work together to conserve while building world class tourism products to ignite the local economies in these respective regions through Sustainable Mountain Tourism.- -Happy International Mountains Day!","['Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 14']","Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Goal 14  Life below water,News,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Newsletter"

It is also projected to boost intra-African trade by 52.3 percent when import duties and non-tariff barriers are eliminated. Though, there are several challenges and opportunities that Uganda needs to address to harness the potential of the AfCFTA.-The Agreement has been touted as a game changer for economies like Uganda, as it promises larger market opportunities, triggering more trade and investment and allowing greater value addition, export diversification and productivity growth – leading to more and better jobs with greater social inclusion.
-The AfCFTA also promises higher intra-regional trade in agri-food products, including from surplus to deficit countries, thereby stabilising food prices and improving food security in Africa. It offers an opportunity to promote socioeconomic transformation and improve competitiveness through regional value chains in manufacturing while improving competitiveness, triggering greater trade and investment in green enterprises, and promoting socioeconomic transformation.
-Unlocking the Potential of AfCFTA in Uganda
-Under the theme ‘Unlocking the Potential of AfCFTA in Uganda’, the dialogue held as part of the AfCFTA Week activities between 10-12 November 2021, UNDP and partners sought to increase awareness of AfCFTA opportunities for Uganda and identify opportunities for partnership.
-The dialogue, held at the Kampala Serena hotel, was graced by Hon. David Bahati Minister of State for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives (Industry), Hon. Harriet Ntabazi, State Minister for Trade, Ministry of Trade Industry and Cooperatives (Trade), Ms. Geraldine Ssali the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, Mr. Wamkele Mene, the AfCFTA Secretary General and the UN Resident Coordinator Ms. Susan Ngongi Namondo, among other private sector stakeholders.- -Speaking during the dialogue, Hon. Bahati underscored the role of the private sector in spearheading “our effort to take advantage of the opportunities in the AfCFTA.”
-The Minister described the AfCFTA as one of the drivers of Africa’s growth and industrialisation agenda. “With a population of 1.3 billion people and a combined GDP of US$$3.4 trillion, the AfCFTA offers the continent, and Uganda, a solid base for a speedy industrialization,” he said.-Fostering recovery from COVID-19-The Minister noted that implementation of the AfCFTA is timely especially in light of the economic challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely impacted global economic growth projections. “The African Continental Free Trade Area provides us an opportunity to further consolidate our resilience and should catalyse our recovery from the impact of COVID-19,” he said.- -On her part, Dr. Joy Kategekwa, UNDP Africa Strategic Advisor stressed the need for renewed efforts to create awareness about the AfCFTA and the opportunity it presents, a commitment to support and increase the capacity of entrepreneurs and exporters to meet quality standards needed in the market and sustain supply chains while establishing an enabling infrastructure such as roads and energy.-In agreement, citing the example of Ugandan pineapples touted as being the best in the world, Hon. Ntabazi stressed the need to increase quantity and quality of products and services consistently as well as improve packaging and branding to improve the country’s competitiveness. Hon. Bahati called for renewed efforts toward addressing impediments inhibiting nations from fully harnessing the opportunities presented by the AfCFTA market.-Overcoming hindrances to the AfCFTA dream-Different speakers listed a number of challenges, including high interest rates, unfavorable tax policies, quality standards, poor dispute resolution mechanisms, insecurity, low digitalization levels and inability of key institutions to identify opportunities and linking them to entrepreneurs and limited support to boost quality productions.-AfCFTA Secretary General who made a presentation at the dialogue lauded the government of Uganda for the great strides that have been made towards implementation of the AfCFTA.-On her part, UNDP Resident Representative, Ms. Elsie Attafuah underscored the importance of inter-country trade and cooperation, noting that “Development experience shows that no country has ever achieved rapid economic growth and prosperity without trading with other countries.”- -Ms. Attafuah noted that the AfCFTA is an opportunity Uganda cannot afford to lose. “The successful implementation of AfCFTA in Uganda will put us at a new inclusive and sustainable development path by building an industrial value chain and specialization structure based on Uganda’s comparative advantages,” she said.-Africa accounts for just 2.9% of global trade and only about 17% of African exports are intra-continental, compared with 58% for Asia and 65% for Europe. The AfCFTA therefore heralds a new chapter in Africa’s integration and development – one of cooperation through trade to drive economic and structural transformation.-The African Continental Free Trade Area is the world’s largest free trade area which provides an opportunity for countries in Africa to competitively integrate into the global economy, reduce poverty, and promote inclusion. The potential impacts at the household level are also significant.-The third National Development Plan (NDP III) and Vison 2040 identifies Uganda strategic opportunities for positioning to harness the African Continental Free Trade Area. These include: i) a youthful population, the third largest in the World; ii) rapid urbanization; iii) a strong comparative advantage in agriculture and minerals; and iv) a strategic geographical location on the continent which is ideal to position Uganda as trade and logistics hub.-Unlocking AfCFTA Potential-UNDP’s offer is supporting the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives to accelerate Uganda’s implementation of the AfCFTA, focusing on awareness raising, enhancing market access opportunities, preparing a National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy, and establishing a catalytic Trade Finance Facility with special focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).-The support is also geared towards building local and regional partnerships, both technical and financial, for ensuring more efficient implementation of AfCFTA in Uganda.-This is being done in collaboration with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives and with support from key private sector business support organizations such as the Uganda Manufacturers Association (UMA), Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UNCCI), Private Sector Foundation of Uganda (PSFU), Federation of Small and Medium Enterprises of Uganda (FSME-U), the Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA), among others.-For media enquiries, please contact:-Michael Mubangizi,-Communications Analyst, UNDP Uganda,-Email: michael.mubangizi@undp.org,-Tel No.: +256772147564, 0751 423191","['Icon of SDG 01', 'Icon of SDG 08', 'Icon of SDG 09', 'Icon of SDG 10', 'Icon of SDG 12', 'Icon of SDG 17']","Goal 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure,Goal 1  No poverty,Uganda,Goal 8  Decent work and economic growth,Goal 10  Reduced inequalities,Goal 12  Responsible consumption and production,Press release,Topics,Newsletter,Goal 17  Partnerships for the goals,English"

Reports show that NCDs affecting Ugandans include cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, mental health conditions and substance abuse conditions. In Uganda, nearly one in four adults dies from an NCD before the age of 70, and NCDs are estimated to kill around 100,000 Ugandans annually.-Despite commitment and interventions from the Government of Uganda, more needs to be done to invest in prevention and control of NCDs. To strengthen and fast-track multisectoral action in selected countries including Uganda, the United Nations Interagency Task Force (UNIATF) established the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) joint program for prevention and control of NCDs. The catalytic project is intended to fast-track critical actions for the prevention and control of NCDs in Uganda. The 2-year project, funded by the European Union will focus on:--       Briefing parliamentarians on NCD risk factors.--       Supporting parliamentarians to develop effective and feasible laws.--       Undertaking policy dialogue to facilitate a whole-of government and whole of society response to NCDs.-Developing a National NCD Strategy and to strengthen the NCDs multisectoral coordination structure. 
- -Speaking during the project launch, Hon. Margaret Muhanga the Minister of State for Health, noted that the fight against NCDs is in high gear, though the country has funding and technical challenges to fully address NCDs and requires partners to support the country in this fight. She applauded UNDP and WHO for efforts made thus far and pledged Government’s commitment in the implementation of the project as well as support for NCD services in the country.-Need for greater investments to deal with NCDs- -On her part, UNDP Resident Representative Ms. Elsie Attafuah noted the need for greater investment in building partnerships for sustainable health financing and supporting the NCDs multisectoral coordination mechanism for prevention and improved service delivery. She called upon all stakeholders to join hands in the NCD struggle to lessen their impact on both individuals and the country’s economy.-“All sectors have a role to play in mitigating NCD risk factors in their areas of influence as an urgent cross cutting issue of great importance. NCDs prevention starts earlier in life and everybody has a role to play,” she said, reiterating UNDP’s support toward good health and development.-According to the representative from WHO, Dr. Bayo Fatnmbi, the rise of NCDs in Africa and Uganda requires multi-sectoral action that focuses on partnerships through a holistic society approach, increased policy coherence across sectors and through all levels of governance.-The WHO-UNDP Global Joint Programme on Catalyzing Multisectoral Action for NCDs is one of the flagship projects for the United Nations Interagency Task Force.  Uganda is one of three African countries that were identified to pilot this project. The UNIATF works with United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) to provide technical support for scaling up multisectoral action on NCDs and mental health through whole-of-government and society responses. The UNIATF supported Uganda in developing the NCDs investment case and is currently developing the Mental Health Investment Case to guide government on the most effective and cost-effective intervention based on evidence.-Expected outcomes of the project include evidence based, effective and feasible laws and regulations for NCDs risk factors enforced; a whole-of-government and whole-of-society response to NCDs and a National NCD strategy to be updated and implemented.

6 April 2022 – Sana’a, Yemen: US$108 million of additional finance from the World Bank’s International Development Association to step up social protection and support for Yemeni households whose food security affected by the conflict, COVID-19, and climate-related shocks.-An estimated one million Yemenis will benefit from the World Bank’s IDA support package of US$ 169.4 million to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s Emergency Social Protection Enhancement and COVID-19 Response Project in Yemen (ESPECRP) launched back in December 2020.-Over 17 million people in Yemen are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity.-More than seven years of unrelenting conflict, poverty, and displacement have significantly crippled service delivery in key public sectors and crumpled the already-ailing economy in Yemen.-The level of child stunting and wasting in Yemen are among the highest in the world with nearly 2.2 million children under the age of 5 in need of immediate treatment for acute malnutrition. This further erodes Yemen’s human capital and poses a long-term risk to Yemen’s development.-“Healthy and strong Yemeni children mean a long-term prosperity and brighter future for decades to come,” says Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen’s Resident Representative.-ESPECRP is intended to sustain and scale up the impact of the response to the alarming increase of acute malnutrition in Yemen through cash-for-nutrition support, health, and nutrition education. Over 153,000 children and women suffering from malnutrition will benefit from the project’s nutrition programme.-ESPECRP’s income-generating interventions - through labor-intensive cash for works and wage employment – will focus on rehabilitation of community and productive assets (e.g., agriculture land, irrigation systems, rural roads, water, and sanitation). This will support the livelihoods of food-insecure households and put cash in the hands of nearly 122,000 Yemenis to afford food and other basic needs.-The project also seeks to mitigate the effects of climate change through community investments in flood prevention, land protection, irrigation canals, and water conservation.-Through targeted grants and technical assistance, as well as increased access to finance, the World Bank fund will also extend economic support to nearly 8,000 existing small and micro businesses across Yemen. This will help local businesses continue to operate and provide its local goods and services and generate jobs.   -Building upon the success of the World Bank’s IDA US$ 400 million Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project (YECRP), UNDP and the World Bank have signed another two funds – the Social Protection Enhancement and COVID-19 Response Project (SPECRP) and Yemen Food Security Response and Resilience Project (FSRRP)– to scale up their emergency response and support for social protection interventions and food security resilience through cash transfers, livelihoods restoration, and provision of key services.-“Through IDA’s support, the strategic partnership between UNDP and the World Bank in Yemen has helped millions of Yemenis to overcome multiple crises caused by the war, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sana’a, Yemen – The European Union (EU) and Sweden have contributed new funding totaling US$ 49.37 million to boost resilience, livelihoods, food security, and climate adaptation in Yemen. The recently signed agreement to support the third phase of the Supporting Resilient Livelihoods, Food Security and Climate Adaption in Yemen - Joint Programme (ERRY III) covers a three-year period starting in March 2022.
-The programme aims to enhance capacity of crisis-affected communities to manage local risks and shocks for increased resilience and self-reliance. Specifically, it will target the most vulnerable community groups, including women, the unemployed, youth, marginalized minority groups, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and stressed host communities.-“The European Union believes in the future of Yemen and in the ability of Yemenis to build resilience and pathways towards sustainable development even during the ongoing conflict,” said the EU Ambassador to Yemen Gabriel Munuera Viñals. “With the additional funding, the European Union contributes to investing in Yemen’s future while supporting people in Yemen to address immediate challenges.”-The programme will potentially reach nearly 847,000 direct beneficiaries and will be implemented jointly by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the World Food Programme (WFP).
-“It is critical to support communities throughout Yemen in local development to strengthen their resilience towards external shocks such as the conflict and the economic crisis,” said the Head of the Regional Development Cooperation at the Sweden Embassy in Amman, Ms Maria Selin. Through ERRY III, we will work with UNDP, FAO, ILO, and WFP so that women, youth, and men have enhanced opportunities to access sustainable livelihoods and job opportunities through climate sensitive programming.”-Considering the social and cultural barriers rural women face in Yemen, the ERRY III activities will also focus on strengthening women's economic empowerment, including women at all stages of implementation, and addressing the specific needs and opportunities for women.-“The new phase of the ERRY joint programme builds upon the success of Phase II, a successful three-year programme that was also funded by EU and Sida. The programme significantly enhanced resilience, food security, and livelihood for over 740,000 vulnerable people in Abyan, Hajjah, Hodiedah, Lahj, and Taiz governorates,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen. “These services are critical to reduce vulnerability and strengthened resilience of crisis affected rural communities in Yemen through the creation of sustainable livelihoods and improving access to basic services.”-The UN agencies will work together to ensure that community institutions are strengthened, and their capacity is developed around the following focus areas:

A first of its kind in Yemen, this hybrid system can sustain power for 24 hours to facilitate steady provision of critical health services by using an innovative on-and-off-grid and diesel solution. A hybrid solar system is cost effective and efficient in Yemen, where regular power outages and other systemic issues weaken the health system.-The project was made possible by generous support from the Government of Italy and was implemented by UNDP’s Rapid Financing Facility (RFF) which aims to strengthen community resilience to shocks and crises.-During the first and second COVID-19 waves, the Seiyun hospital cared for COVID-19 patients with limited beds (10). As the infection rate increased, so did the COVID-19 response capacity with 24 beds. Despite this, however, electricity remained challenging for the hospital administration. However, with a capacity of 40 kW solar photovoltaic, 55 kW from the utility grid and backup generator, and a 240 kWh storage bank, everything has now changed.-“The solar hybrid solution has reduced the cost of electricity by $17,500 a year. In addition, the system can help run 10 ventilators, several machines, and 17 air-conditioners,” says Mr. Anees Aideed, the hospital’s Director. “We have also saved on the cost of diesel and the COVID-19 Isolation Unit response capacity has increased,” he adds.-In addition to serving the local communities in Seiyun and the surrounding areas of Hadramout, this COVID-19 Isolation Unit also serves the local communities in the governorates of Al-Maharah, Marib, and Shabwah. Furthermore, Seiyun is home to a growing population of internally-displaced people (IDPs) with more than 50 per cent of the IDPs visiting the center for general and COVID-19 treatment.-“Considering it is the only COVID-19 isolation unit and facility for more than 500,000 people in the region, the support from UNDP has boosted our confidence and response capacity to confront the pandemic,” says Mr. Abdul Hadi Al Tamimi, the Deputy Governor. “Thanks to UNDP for such a provision and critical support,” he further adds.-The environmental impact of the isolation centre hybridization of electricity sources will save more than 636 tons of carbon dioxide over the lifetime of the equipment.-***-Press Contacts

Generously funded by the Government of Japan, this effort is the first of a larger plan to deliver 100 fishing boats, 100 boat engines, 500 fishing nets and 500 GPS devices that will be evenly distributed between Aden and Mukalla. The second delivery of items is expected later this month in Aden.-Conflict has affected more than 70 per cent of small-scale fishers – the backbone of the fisheries sector. Through the Rebuilding Livelihoods and Capacities of Conflict-Affected Small-Scale Fisheries Households in Aden and Hadramout (RELACC) project, the fishery production in Aden and Mukalla is being supported and revamped. The distribution of boats, engines, fishing nets, and GPS will assist small-scale fishers meet market demand and supply by improving their production and catch rates. Equipped with cooling storage for the fishers’ catch, the boats will also help resolve the issue of cold storage at the production level.-In December 2021, UNDP and YLDF distributed 500 financial grants worth US$950 each – 250 provided to fishers in both Aden and Mukalla – to help fishery communities establish supporting fishing businesses. The grants were preceded by the project helping 1,000 Yemenis learn to fix fishing assets such as boats, boat engines, and fishing nets, as well as build their entrepreneurial skills to help them improve and sustain their livelihood opportunities.-“When I first saw this project advertised, I knew that I could help my grandfather make fishing hooks. The training and grant allowed me to make different types of hooks and sell them to the fishers in need,” says Hanan, aged 30 from Hadramout.-The project has also encouraged women’s participation in fisheries, an industry where the employment rate is almost negligible. With 30 per cent participation of women, the local fishing businesses focused on converting fish waste into fertilizers, salt production and packaging, fish farming, sale of dry fish, fishing equipment stores, and maintenance of fishing equipment.-UNDP and YLDF collaborated with General Fisheries Authority (GFA) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries Wealth in Aden and Hadramout with full support to implement the RELACC project. The GFA partnership has also helped build ownership and sustainability of the implemented interventions.-“The conflict has severely impacted the fisheries sector, and subsequently small-scale fishers and their livelihoods, income, and food security,” says the Project Manager, Arvind Kumar. “This project is expected to improve and strengthen the fishing community’s resilience though vital generation of sustainable incomes,” he adds.-                                                                       ***-Press Contacts-UNDP Yemen: Leanne Rios, Team Lead: Communications and Advocacy Leanne.rios@undp.org-

As a consequence, communities are suffering from the increased risk of disease outbreak due to poor waste management. With the continual influx of displaced Yemenis fleeing to Hadramout from frontline conflict, the already damaged systems struggle to adequately serve the growing populations. -The new project will support improved WASH systems in five healthcare centres in Hadramout, including water supply and handwashing services, the rehabilitation of sanitation systems and training and systems development for medical waste management. This support will benefit over 50,000 local residents to access more well-equipped health services. -One of the five centres targeted will be focused on reproductive health, supporting women’s access to safe pre- and post-natal care.-An additional 20,100 Yemenis will benefit from life-saving emergency WASH interventions in communities affected by COVID-19, war and severe weather damage. These interventions will include repairs and/or installation of water and sanitation systems, support for solid waste collection and disposal, and community awareness raising to encourage best practice. -“This new project builds upon existing success from UNDP’s recently completed 3-year WASH project – also funded by Japan – which improved local water and waste management systems and service delivery for over 850,000 people in Aden and Mukalla,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Resident Representative in Yemen. “These services are critical to a sustainable recovery in Yemen, building a healthier foundation for Yemenis to rebuild their lives free from the risk of disease.” -This agreement builds upon a well-established partnership between UNDP and the Government of Japan and reaffirms a joint commitment to serve Yemeni communities, helping to rebuild and achieve a sustainable, peaceful recovery for all.- -Press Contacts

 Aden, Yemen, 19 December 2021 – With funding from the Government of Japan, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and its local partner, For All Foundation (FAF), began the distribution of 1,000 financial grants to Yemenis in Aden and Lahj – including 500 women. The US$ 800 grants will enable recipients to establish their own small businesses and achieve a sustainable income.

Prior to grant distribution, recipients were employed through cash-for-work to rehabilitate 10 safe spaces in Aden and Lahj, earning critical income that allowed them to purchase necessities for their families. Recipients then participated in business management training, helping build their knowledge in financial planning and asset management.

“Small businesses are the heart of local economy and UNDP supports them to strive and thrive,” says Arvind Kumar, UNDP Project Manager. “They also help reduce Yemen’s high unemployment rate and provide critical services to communities.”

The recipients of the grants will cover a range of service sectors including electrical and home appliance maintenance, fisheries, car mechanics, baking, food-processing, and handloom and textiles.

“This grant will enable me to open a shop where people can arrange the repair of their solar systems or the installation of new ones. The high demand for solar power systems has created new opportunities for sustainable energy and sustainable incomes,” says Al Bara’a, a grant recipient.

Throughout the distribution process, all the recipients will have access to psychosocial support sessions to ensure their mental health and well-being and to build the confidence as they embark on a new professional and personal journey.

With funding from the Government of Japan, UNDP’s Building Resilient Livelihoods and Improving Protection Services for Conflict Affected Communities in Aden and Lahj (BRISCC) project targets the communities most affected by the ongoing conflict in Aden and Lahj. The key areas of focus include: (a) identification of needs and opportunities for affected communities to return to normal; (b) restoration of disrupted livelihoods for the crisis-affected population; and (c) strengthening of community-based protection mechanisms with a focus on women and youth.-

Millions of Yemenis continue to suffer from the conflict, trapped in poverty and with little possibility for jobs and livelihoods,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.” The study presents a clear picture of what the future could look like with a lasting peace including new, sustainable opportunities for people. To help to get there, the entire UN family continues to work with communities throughout the country to shape a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous future for all Yemenis.”-The report comes as Yemen continues to be mired in a conflict underway since 2015, which in addition to loss of life is tearing apart livelihoods, social fabric, causing Yemen to teeter on the brink of famine, and resulting in widespread reversals of development progress. The report projects that in the last six years the crisis has caused Yemen to miss out on US $126 billion of potential economic growth.-The report, carried out by the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver, is the third installment of the Impact of War on Yemen series. Like the previous editions, the report uses an integrated statistical modeling technique that forecasts future scenarios.-While identifying potential peace dividends, the report also contains grim projects of future trajectories should the conflict continue into 2022 and beyond.-Should the conflict continue through 2030, the report projects that it will have taken 1.3 million lives by that year. Moreover, the report shows that a growing proportion of those deaths will occur not due to fighting, but due to second-order impacts that the crisis is waging on livelihoods, food prices, and the deterioration of basic services such as health and education. Thus far, the report projects that 60 percent of deaths during the crisis have been caused by these secondary factors – a proportion projected to grow to 75 per cent by 2030 should the war continue.-In this way, the report sheds light on the lesser-known yet widespread impacts that a persisting crisis in Yemen will continue to have across key dimensions of development and well-being. The crisis has already pushed an additional 4.9 million people into malnutrition, and the report projects that this toll will grow to 9.2 million by 2030 should the war persist; by the same year, the number of people living in extreme poverty would surge to 22 million, 65% of the population.-While urging that peace is the only viable way forward to end suffering in Yemen, the report also calls upon national, regional, and international stakeholders to adopt an inclusive and holistic recovery process, across sectors and inclusive of the entirety of Yemeni society.  Support for recovery must go far beyond infrastructure and have people at the centre; investment focused on agriculture, women’s empowerment, capacity development, and effective and inclusive governance and institutions are projected to have the highest return on development.-The analysis emphasizes that women’s empowerment is key to recovery, with projections showing that focused efforts on uplifting women and girls across Yemen can lead to a 30 % boost of GDP by 2050, coupled with a halving of maternal mortality by 2029.-The report sends a hopeful message that not all is lost in Yemen. However, it also makes clear that with the staggering effects of the conflict witnessed over the last six years, there is no time to waste as the situation continues to propel in a downward spiral. Plans to support recovery must be continuously developed even as fighting continues.-“The people of Yemen are eager to move forward into a recovery of sustainable and inclusive development,” said Khalida Bouzar, Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States. “UNDP stands ready to further strengthen our support to them on this journey to leave no one behind, so that the potential of Yemen and the region can be fully realized – and so that once peace is secured, it can be sustained.”-UNDP works across Yemen to help people meet their most basic needs, restore livelihoods, support communities, and advance peacebuilding.

While national authorities were able to boast significant improvements during this period, the reignition of violent conflict in 2014 and 2015 now demands a response to the increased and more complex contamination of explosive hazards – including a significant increase in the prevalence of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).-“Safety and security are fundamental to the peacebuilding process,” explains Auke Lootsma, UNDP Yemen Resident Representative. “Without the institutional capacity to clear explosive hazards in Yemen, civilians are left with no choice but to risk their life and limb to carry out everyday tasks. This is not a backdrop against which we can achieve sustainable peace,” he adds.
-The Dutch funding will help establish a new three-year project – Emergency Mine Action Project – Phase II – that aims to build upon existing results to strengthen institutional capacity to respond to the threat of explosive hazards, and to improve awareness among local communities to avoid them. It will be Implemented across Yemen, with a particular focus on contaminated communities.-All activities will be implemented in cooperation with local partners, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC) located in Sana'a and Aden, the Yemen Mine Action Co-ordination Centre, and the National Mine Action Centre (NMAC). They will focus upon:-“Demining is an important means to improve human security,” says Peter-Derrek Hof, Ambassador of the Netherlands Embassy to Yemen in Amman. “By supporting the Mine Action project, the Netherlands contributes to building a society in Yemen in which people will regain access to safety and security, schools, hospitals, markets, livelihoods and other important resources and services, necessary for socio-economic development,” he adds.
-This agreement builds upon a previous partnership between UNDP and the Netherlands that supported mine action efforts in Yemen over the last five years, and reenforces the long-standing commitment of the Netherlands and UNDP to the safety and security of all Yemenis.

This has been supported by the funds generously provided to the GRZ-UN Joint Programme on GBV Phase II by the Governments of Ireland and Sweden.-The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Gender, Dr.  Sastone Silomba commended this gesture as it complements Government’s efforts of ensuring continued service and health care for all.-“As we receive these hygiene products, PPEs and the project motor vehicle on behalf of implementing partners as they continue to implement the Joint GRZ-UN GBV Programme Phase II we are aware that the majority of GBV victims are women and girls. Anecdotal reports show that during the pandemic cases of GBV have increased thereby putting many women and girls at risk and increasing the demand for such services.”-The Joint Programme is responding to challenges faced by service providers such as police, safe shelter managers and law enforcement officers. The Programme is therefore contributing to enabling business continuity where the provision of quality services is sustained amidst the challenges presented by COVID19.  - - ",[],"News,Zambia,Gender equality,Sexual and gender-based violence,English"

The report argues that we are in an unprecedented moment in the history of our planet, that scientists term “Anthropocene,” a new geological epoch: the age of humans. For the first time in our long 300,000-year relationship, instead of the planet shaping humans, human activity is shaping the planet.
-“This report calls for a renewed commitment to and investment in multilateralism, with better monitoring and enforcement so that the actions of a few countries do not limit the choices of all. The Anthropocene forces us to recognise that it is not enough to look at planetary imbalances in silos. We need to see challenges as interdependent and make systemic changes collectively” says Trevor Kaunda, the Permanent Secretary for Development Cooperation, Monitoring and Evaluation in Zambia’s Ministry of National Development Planning.
-The report shows that across the globe, human development has largely happened with huge pressure on the planet showing that no country in the world has achieved yet the magic combination of high Human Development and low planetary pressure. The report argues that humans are destabilizing the very systems they need to survive and resulting pressures on our planetary systems are manifested not just as climate change and biodiversity loss but in many other ways including pollution, ocean acidification, land degradation that are affecting disproportionality developing countries. Inequalities between and within countries not only reflect unequal consequences of a dangerous planetary change, gross imbalances of power and opportunities are also the major obstacle in the way of finding solutions. For example, the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather a year by 2100, whereas rich countries could have this number reduced to 18 days a year, despite being more responsible for climate change.
-It is time for all countries to redesign their development paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change. To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).
-By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress. With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress.
-The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming people’s values and social norms, scaling up nature-based solutions, creating the right incentives for change and enforcing tailor-made regulations that influence our decision making to promote rather than prevent planetary damage, the report argues.
-The report further suggest that to steer actions towards transformational change, it is important to empower people in three ways, by enhancing equity, by pursuing innovation and by instilling a sense of stewardship of nature grounded on the responsible use and protection of the natural environment through conservation and sustainable practices to enhance ecosystem resilience and human wellbeing.
-A range of nature-based solutions comprising reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the report shows.
-In Zambia, the virtual event was organized around speeches and a panel discussion where experts from the Government, the United Nations, the Development community, the academia, think tanks and civil society organisations enlightened the exchanges on the 2020 Human Development Report.
-“As this report shows, Zambia’s human development index value for 2019 is 0.584. This puts the country in the medium human development category and at position 146 of the 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, Zambia’s HDI value increased from 0.421 to 0.584, an increase of 38.7 percent,” Permanent Secretary Kaunda said, noting that while it is gratifying to note progress for the country, Zambia still needs to do more if it is to attain the set objectives outlined in the vision 2030. It is worth noting that Zambia’s life expectancy at birth increased by 14.6 years, mean years of schooling increased by 2.5 years and expected years of schooling increased by 4.0 years. Zambia’s GNI per capita increased by about 65.0 percent between 1990 and 2019. He said Government is committed to exploring new frontiers aimed at building a more resilient and sustainable Zambia.
-“For the UN System in Zambia in particular, this report provides timely theoretical and empirical reference materials for the development of our Country Analysis and new Cooperation Framework that will form the basis of our support within our next programmatic cycle. This report's findings and recommendations provide ‘food for thought’, data and background information to inform the design of policies towards sustainable development,” the UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio said, reaffirming the United Nations’ commitment to working with the Government and partners on advancing sustainable development in the country.
-“It is worth noting and commendable that Zambia has been using the HDI as a key indicator in its Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP),” said Lionel Laurens, UNDP Resident Representative in Zambia. “We must work together and go beyond discrete solutions to individual problems and instead focus on mechanisms that will transform our lifestyles, how we work, eat, interact and, most of all, how we consume energy. We must also recognize that we are part of nature and not separate from it and could learn from traditional societies that have maintained a strong sense of responsibility and agency because they recognize that our humanity is part of a larger network of connections with nature, with the planet and with all living things.” He added

-“The Government through the Ministry of Higher Education will think of this signing not only in terms of what we will be able to achieve in terms of collaboration but in a much wider context of generally developing Science, Technology and Innovation as well as Education and skills Development and its position in the development of our country,” the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Higher Education Ms. Kayula Siame said at the signing ceremony in Lusaka. -“We are pleased to align the contribution of UNDP around the vision of the Government of the Republic of Zambia for a country which leverages its young population for productive and meaningful engagement in the sustainable development of the nation,” said Lionel Laurens, the UNDP Resident Representative in Zambia, noting that the collaboration reaffirms UNDP’s continuous support to Zambia ́s efforts to spur progress toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
-Through the MoU, the Ministry of Higher Education and UNDP will promote public awareness in areas such as enhancing gender equality through supporting initiatives to encourage girls and women to pursue higher education, vocational education and training and specialize in scientific research and technological innovation to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, which are essential conditions for achieving the SDGs. The cooperation will simultaneously promote innovations and internship programmes and connect potential youth volunteers with opportunities to contribute meaningfully to their communities, while gaining valuable work experience and skills for future employment. As part of the agreement, the two institutions will collaborate on promoting knowledge sharing and mutual learning to accelerate transformation in line with the SDGs. -To achieve the goals of the MoU, both the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Higher Education Kayula Siame and UNDP Resident Representative Lionel Laurens reaffirmed their commitment to work together for strategic and coordinated approach for delivering impact and call for innovative partnerships to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with Government, civil society, Cooperating Partners, International Financing Institutions and private sector and identify innovative financing models. -“We will continue the strategic dialogue on our joint priorities, at all levels, so that we can complement and leverage each organization’s comparative advantage to the benefit of our country's development,” Siame said. When all key stakeholders do their part and forge partnerships that pull in the same direction, reaching the SDGs by 2030 will no longer be a vision; it will be reality,” Laurens said.

The innovation grant aims to promote sustainable waste management practices that improve the welfare of the waste collectors, provides employment opportunities to the youth and women and promotes a circular economy through recycling of waste. The call innovation is part of UNDP Accelerator Lab Network global initiative that was launched in 2019 with support from key Cooperating Partners including Germany, Qatar and Italy. Through long-standing partnerships with national governments, AccLabs are creating a new capability for decision-makers to explore, experiment, and grow portfolios of mutually reinforcing solutions to tackle 21st century complex challenges from multiple angles to accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and Leave On One Behind.-Speaking during the virtual Innovation Award Ceremony, UNDP Resident Representative, Lionel Laurens said that 187 entrepreneurs applied for the Call, which ran from June to August this year. The 10 selected youth innovations are awarded USD 4,000 each to address sustainable waste management challenges in Ndola and Lusaka districts and will be enrolled into a mentorship programme to sharpen their business skills. The recipients include 6 entrepreneurs from Lusaka, 4 from Ndola whilst five of them are female-led initiatives.-In encouraging the winners, the UNDP Resident Representative said, “I want to encourage the selected 10 to take advantage of this opportunity to develop their business initiatives. Make every use of the mentorship support that you will receive from the experienced business consultants to walk the initial steps of this journey with you. UNDP has demonstrated its trust in you and your vision by choosing to invest resources to start up your businesses, and now it is up to you to turn your ideas into prosperous enterprises that will contribute to the development of Zambia”.-In appreciating UNDP for initiating the call to support innovations in waste management, Mr. Edgar Mulwanda, the Public Health Director from Lusaka City Council (LCC) reiterated the need to tackle waste from a sustainability perspective. This involves reduction, reusing and recycling of waste, which are incorporated in the LCC strategic focus. He expressed happiness at the prospect of the innovators helping to accelerate progress towards the 2030 vision of the Council. The multi-faceted challenges in waste management have grave impacts on human health and the environment, causing diseases such as cholera, dysentery and pollution, as well as water, air, soil or land contamination, proliferation of pests and vermin and the loss of aesthetic beauty.-The Innovation Call, which was open to Zambian youths aged between 18 – 35, with 50% allocation to women in Lusaka and Ndola. The Call focused on solutions to the challenge of waste recycling, with demonstrable capacity of their entrepreneur to continue their activities beyond the life of the funding made available.-In thanking UNDP on behalf of all awarded entrepreneurs, Lizzy Banda of Sunshine Group Zambia, one of the ten awardees said the award was going to go a long way in ensuring attainment of their dreams. - ",['Icon of SDG 11'],"News,Goal 11  Sustainable cities and communities"

Only fifteen percent reported to have maintained normal operations. The Education, Transport and Catering and Accommodation Sectors have been particularly impacted by Covid-19 while other sectors were almost not affected. Eighty-five percent (85%) businesses working in education reported to be completely closed, while sixty percent (60%) of businesses in the human health and social work sector maintained normal operations.-The report also proposes recommendations on relevant policies and provides baselines for the government, development and cooperating partners to design projects and policies to assist and support impacted businesses by the Covid-19 outbreak. The policy recommendations highlighted in this report are based on real-time evidence, gathered from the online survey conducted in May 2020, covering 706 large, medium, small and micro enterprises as well as a thorough review of reports and research literature published by different organizations on the impact of the pandemic. The report also shows that loss of customers is the most significant challenge rated by 77.3% of the respondents. Other reported challenges include supply chain cuts at 37.7%, high commodity prices/material prices reported at 36.0 % and problems with late payments at 32.3%, among others. These challenges are expected to affect operating revenue for enterprises.-The Survey revealed that the majority of enterprises are committed to continue operations by adhering to the new normal requirements to do businesses alongside Covid-19 threats. Enterprises have further resolved to adopt new development strategies by embracing and exploring new business models, accelerating technological, product and services innovation, and strengthening global reach of supply chain and expansion of overseas market.  However, 7% of the total responding enterprises reported to have failed to cope with the epidemic and expressed their intention to withdraw from the market.-Against this backdrop, Honorable Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Christopher Yaluma said that quantifying the real impact of the Covid-19  was difficult, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, but noted that the survey focused on understanding the possible socio-economic repercussions in order to propose policy recommendations aimed at mitigating the impact on the economy. He added that: “It is my expectation that the report has generated sufficient information indicating the areas that need improvement in terms of policy interventions for private sector development. In view of the foregoing, it is in the best interest of both government and private sector to note the findings of the study. I am confident that the Survey Results will give a clear indication of how business enterprises have been affected in Zambia and provide comprehensive policy actions aimed at mitigating the impact of the disease on the economy”.-Speaking at the launch of the report, UNDP Resident Representative, Lionel Laurens, said that the pandemic has had a huge impact on the economy, which requires moving together to assist the private sector to get through this difficult period.-Mr. Laurens said that: “Development Partners, including the United Nations are ready to assist Government to take on the longer-term challenge of transitioning to a more sustainable economy and working with its key partners support the co-design of a green stimulus package to address the economic crisis (growing inequalities) and the climate crisis. This work would fall into 4 areas: (1) Impact investment for the transition to a green economy; (2) Green businesses and green jobs through local economic development, urban planning, sustainable homes, sustainable procurement, and innovation; (3) Nature-based solutions and green infrastructure; (4)  Social protection system that adequately protect vulnerable workers in the labour market...”-The support to the Rapid Covid-19 Business Survey is part of the broader support being provided by the UN system in Zambia to the Government of Zambia to assess the socio-economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in Zambia. It aims to anticipate and propose measures to manage and mitigate its consequences in the short, medium and long term chiefly to safeguard the country’s sustainable growth path and achievements within the national development objectives enshrined in the 7NDP and the Vision 2030. -To access Business Survey Report - the impact of COVID-19 on enterprises in Zambia

Law enforcement officers are at the frontline of the fight not only at ports of entry but also within communities as they act as pro-active agents who can help contribute to public awareness measures encouraging citizen to adopt positive behaviours and adhere to prevention measures. Thus, day-to-day interaction between law enforcement agents and citizens creates strong opportunities for containment or the farther spread of the virus. 
-At the launch, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative, Lionel Laurens has said that, “during such periods, its vital that international human rights standards are maintained and that vulnerable groups are protected. Our support, which includes the SOP, will equip the security and law enforcement sector in Zambia with information, tools and skills to deal with the COVID-19. This includes ensuring information on COVID-19 for law enforcement, materials to reduce risk of contamination for law enforcement officers, business continuity, dealing with citizens particularly offenders of new restrictions, and general public sensitization on safeguarding human rights in the context of COVID-19.”
-And highlighting the UN’s experience and technical approach, UN Resident Coordinator, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio has underscored that the SOP is an important blueprint that “the Zambia Police Service may utilize for years to come and adapt in response to other global pandemics that may impact citizens. The UN’s technical approach and expertise offers stakeholders opportunities to consider the Human Rights impact of COVID-19 and safeguarding progress towards achieving the SDGs, including addressing stigma and discrimination arising from its spread and supporting marginalized people and vulnerable populations”.
-The Zambia Police Inspector General, Kakoma Kanganja observed that with a force of approximately 20,000 personnel country-wide, Zambia Police Service provides a key service. He emphasised that the SOP “has been tailored to adequately meet modern policing strategies” and that it “inherently recognises the need for all Zambia Police Service officers to uphold human rights and respect gender in the course of their duty during this period and beyond.”
-The UNDP programmatic and policy offer builds upon past experience with the Ebola and Zika epidemics as well as pandemics including HIV, TB and malaria, and a long history of working together with countries and communities – with the public and private sector - to prepare for, mitigate, and tackle complexity and crisis with the necessary urgency.  Against this backdrop, UNDP in contributing to develop this SOP capitalized on its long-standing partnership with the Zambia Police Service and the Human Rights Commission (HRC), tapped into its global network of expertise to draw technical support from the UN Police, UNDP New York and the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights.
-This intervention is part of the wider UN response to COVID-19 in Zambia in support of the Government of Zambia’s Multisectoral COVID-19 Contingency and Response Plan and complements the strong collaborative efforts from the Government, civil society, private sector and all development partners to end COVID-19.

These solar systems allow these health centers now to operate as  Outpatient Departments (OPD) for 24 hours a day.
-Dr. Minyoi Health Centre and Kamiba Clinic, located in Mayukwayukwa and Meheba Resettlement Schemes both received and installed solar systems costing USD24,000.00 and USD 33,400 respectively.-“At Dr. Minyoi Health Post, we had failed to become fully operational after the clinic was commissioned in 2016. The health facility lacked basic services such as lighting and water. Without proper lighting, we had become accustomed to using candle-lights or torches”, said Health Coordinator, Steven Mafumo.-As Mayuykwayukwa and Meheba are not yet connected to the national electricity grid, Dr. Minyoi and Kamiba Health Centres have been able to leap-frog this power challenge with support from UNDP and the Government of Japan.-The support provided includes the installation of the solar systems, which comprised of off-grid PV systems with Li-ion (liFePO4) battery banks and 230 VAC sinusoidal inverters, including earthing, distribution boards, sockets, indoor and outdoor LED lights with switches, ceiling fans with rotary timer switches. It also includes after-sales services for a year, maintenance (preventative and corrective) together with technical maintenance (on-site preventive /on call curative).-This, according to Steven Mafumo, is a significant milestone for Mayukwayukwa Resettlement Scheme, which is managed by the Department of Resettlement, and oversees approximately 550 households comprised of Former Refugees and Zambians.-Mafumo notes that, “with the solar energy system fully installed, medical supplies will be stored refrigerated unlike in the past when the provision was absent. Essentially, it is expected that with improved service delivery, there will be improved health outcomes”.-The installation of solar panels is part of a grant of USD500,000.00 in total from the Government of Japan to support several activities for the sustainable resettlement of former refugees in Zambia. The overall goal of the programme is that, by 2021, communities living in the targeted resettlement schemes are cohesive, productive, sustainable and fully integrated into development at all levels. -According to the UNDP Officer in-charge of Inclusive Growth and SDGs, Jan Willem van den Broek, “the Promoting Human Security Through Sustainable Resettlement Programme has three main objectives, “firstly, that Government at national and sub-national level undertake inclusive and participatory planning and governance processes that incorporate the targeted resettlement schemes; secondly, communities in and around the targeted resettlement schemes have access to social services and sustainable economic opportunities; and thirdly, resettlement communities are tolerant, inclusive and integrated with the surrounding society, enabling people to live in freedom and dignity and to fully realize their human potential.”- - - - - - - - - - - - ",['Icon of SDG 03'],"Goal 3  Good health and well-being,News,Press release"
